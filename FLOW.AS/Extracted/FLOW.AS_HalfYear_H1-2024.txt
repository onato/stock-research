Our risk management


Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk Management
Framework (ERMF) forms the foundation of our
approach to managing risks. The ERMF is
documented in Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk
Management Policy and is reviewed on an
annual basis.

Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify
and document potential risks which are inherent to
trading and automated market-making. In this
dynamic environment, we designed our ERMF in
such a way that it is robust, efficient and transparent.
In the figure on the right, we present the
stakeholders that have an interest and place value in
how our framework operates.


Our ERMF helps us to ensure that we have adequate
systems and controls including the management of
our liquidity and capital. This is delivered through a
consistent, continuous and careful method for
addressing, managing and prioritizing our key risks
in the context of our strategic goals.

well as all employees are aware of the risks that our
Company faces and their responsibilities in
managing these efficiently.


Our risk management is organized along three lines
of defence.The first line of defence is comprised of
Trading, Technology and Operations. These
departments are critical for managing the core
processes within Flow Traders and are responsible for
incorporating preventive and detective controls into
the day-to-day trading and IT processes as well as for
the continuous monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems
and trading controls.


The second line of defence is responsible for
oversight and monitoring of risks, rules and
requirements. Risk, Compliance and Finance
manage risks through a combination of preventive
and detective controls. Together they are responsible
for the continuous risk management of Flow Traders.
On the second line we have the Financial Capital Risk
Committee and the Non-Financial Compliance
Committee. The Financial Capital Risk Committee
includes oversight reporting and planning in relation
to market, credit and treasury risk within the firm.
Whereas, the Non-Financial Compliance Committee
reviews a wide range of risks that are not directly
related to financial matters, such as operational risks,
reputational risks, strategic risks, legal and regulatory
risks, technology risks and ESG risks.


The third line of defence is formed by Flow Traders’
Internal Audit function (IA). They provide
independent and objective assurance and advice on
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk
management and control systems. This achieves the
competent application of systematic and disciplined
processes, expertise, and insight. They report their

The annual Risk Management Cycle follows the
below Risk Management Framework
Every year the Executive Directors and Executive
Committee sets its business targets following the
strategic goals. The strategic goals are generally
formulated in November/December. The Board
approves the strategic goals and business targets.


Additionally, the Board is involved in the strategy
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals,
short-term targets are determined. These targets are
then translated into annual Company-wide,
departmental and individual goals and discussed in
an annual meeting with the Executive Directors, the
Executive Committee and all relevant Managing
Directors.


Based on the targets and objectives, the Executive
Directors and Executive Committee formulates the
risk appetite of the Company. The targets, objectives
and risk appetite give direction to the various
departments within Flow Traders and are used to
derive the Company’s strategic risks.


Flow Traders’ Risk Management cycle is used to
identify, manage and mitigate our financial, non-
financial and compliance risk. The risk cycle consists
of four recurring activities; risk identification &
assessment, risk control, risk monitoring and risk
reporting. The cycle is designed and implemented to
determine & assess our risk, take mitigating actions
to control our risk, monitor the effectiveness and
developments of the taken measures and report
findings and effectiveness of all measurements and
actions taken. The risk cycle will ensure that our
residual risk profile will remain in line with our annual
set risk appetite and that emerging risks, changed

The Whistleblower Policy has wide applications,
including in respect of topics such as fraud, market

that is being reported. We respect a non-retaliation
approach when a suspected misconduct is reported.

a) Reportable segments
The Executive Directors of the Board examine the Group performance from a
regional perspective and have identified three reportable segments of its global
trading business: Europe, the Americas and Asia.


Europe consists of activities in The Netherlands with institutional trading
activities in France, UK, Italy, trading activities in Jersey and IT activities in
Romania. Americas consists of the subsidiaries in the USA. Asia contains our
subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore and a Chinese representative office in
Shanghai. The Executive Directors of the Board consider this segmentation to be
relevant to understand the Group financial performance because it allows
investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate
the operating performance and decision making about allocation of resources
and trading capital.


b) Basis of presentation
The Group measures results on an IFRS basis and reconciles the total segment
results on net trading income, profit before tax and net profit. Significant
transactions and balances between geographic regions occur primarily as result
of Group operating companies incurring the operating expenses such as

In 2024, no transfers in or out of level 3 took place (2023: nil). The following table
shows the movement in level 3 assets, please also refer to note 17 & 18. The fair
value of the level 3 investments is determined based on the latest transaction
price. The fair value is reassessed based on internal reviews of the investments'
milestone performance and runway. Changes in the unobservable inputs used to
determine fair value may result in an increase or decrease in fair value.

b) Joint Venture


The Group has invested in a joint venture in which it has joint control and a 35.5%
ownership interest through voting preferred shares as of March 2024. The Group,
along with the other investors identified in the Shareholder Agreement as Major
Investors, must each approve (with unanimous consent) the matters relating to
the relevant activities of the joint venture. This results in collective control of the
arrangement.


The Group does not consider the assessment of control a significant judgement
under IAS 1, given the nature of the contractual terms and the activities that
require agreement from each major investor. According to the shareholders'
agreement, the Group is considered a major investor.

deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the
statement of financial position.


The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for
offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because they create a
right to offset recognized amounts for the parties to the agreement that is
enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Group or the counterparties or following other predetermined events.


In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net
basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.


The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can
receive and grant collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in
respect of the following transactions:


▪   derivatives;
▪   sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
▪   securities lending and borrowing.

The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable
securities as set out in notes 12 and 21 in respect of derivatives (including swaps).
Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms including, where
appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities received/
granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction,
but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each
party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure
to post collateral.


Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include:
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set-off liabilities against
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event of
the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit exposure.
However, the offsetting criteria in IFRS 9 are not met in all cases.
