Message of the Board
From left to right: Folkert Joling, Roger Hodenius, Jan van Kuijk, Linda Hovius, Rudolf Ferscha, Olivier Bisserier and Mike 
Kuehnel. 
Throughout 2022, Flow Traders continued to 
deliver value to its stakeholders globally while 
focusing on driving transparency, efficiency, and 
accessibility across markets. As a multi-asset 
global liquidity provider, we further executed on 
our ambitious growth strategy, diversified the 
business, expanded our leading positions across 
asset classes and capitalized on the evolution of 
the financial markets. 
We grew our talented team with a record 
number of new hires across all markets, while 
our leadership layer was strengthened by the 
formation of a global Executive Committee in 
September.
Towards the end of the year, Dennis Dijkstra, 
following fourteen years with the business made 
the decision not to stand for reappointment as 
CEO at the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The 
role was assumed by Mike Kuehnel on 1 
February 2023. Mike had served as CFO since 
2021.
Global team 
Throughout the year we remained committed to 
developing our people and fostering our 
entrepreneurial culture, which is core to our 
success. We welcomed 206 new hires globally, a 
record number for the company in a single year. 
We introduced dedicated frameworks to support 
our teams in their professional and personal 
development and designed programs tailored to 
our technology department. 
In September, we welcomed our biggest group 
of graduates ever, further demonstrating that 
Flow Traders is seen as an employer of choice 
within our industry and recognizing our 
dedication to supporting our workforce to reach 
its full potential.
We introduced a global Executive Committee to 
support the Board in accelerating the execution 
of Flow Traders’ strategic growth ambitions. 
Comprised of talent from within the business, 
this centrally coordinated and dedicated senior 
leadership team represents our business areas 
and strengthens our global leadership layer, 
while bringing additional values to the entire 
organization. 
In 2022, Flow Traders introduced a broader and 
enhanced Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy 
to further embrace equal opportunities across 
the workforce and foster a diverse culture. The 
firm also further focused on developing its 
external positioning around this theme by being

active in Women in ETF globally and several 
local initiatives. 
Our people also continued to contribute to 
society and charity, a long standing passion of 
the Flow Traders team. In March 2022, the 
company collaboratively drove charitable 
initiatives to support Ukraine and the colleagues 
impacted. Through the Flow Traders Foundation 
many employees remained actively involved in 
causes across the globe. Employees volunteer 
and donate to support initiatives that focus on 
fighting poverty. In February 2023, Flow 
Traders employees also undertook the challenge 
to climb Kilimanjaro to raise funds for the 
Foundation with more than 30 colleagues taking 
part. 
We continue to be extremely proud of all of our 
colleagues and their dedication to delivering on 
our priorities and contributing to our global 
growth. Flow Traders’ unique culture and 
entrepreneurial spirit has been key to the 
success of the business thus far and will be for 
many years to come.
"Our dedication to pricing 
excellence and innovative 
proprietary trading 
infrastructure further 
enhanced our proposition 
across all asset classes"
Global growth 
Our focus on developing opportunities in the 
rapidly evolving financial markets resulted in 
many positive developments for our business 
throughout the year, underpinning our strength 
and ability to continue providing liquidity. 
Our three core business pillars grew in terms of 
both trading capabilities and footprint. Our 
presence grew across exchanges and trading 
venues and our extensive global counterparty 
network surpassed the 2,000 mark, while we 
also enhanced our institutional trading 
capabilities with dedicated expertise on Fixed 
Income and our newly formed currency, crypto, 
and commodity business pillar.
In Equity, we maintained our position as the 
leading liquidity provider both on- and off-
exchange in Europe, and we collaborated with a 
range of existing and new partners, such as 
iShares and SPDR, to launch innovate financial 
products. 
We also expanded our trading footprint in Asia, 
obtaining a Qualified Foreign Institutional 
Investor (QFII) license in China, and we have 
already successfully executed our first trades 
on-shore in China’s domestic markets. 
Additionally, we received approval to open a 
Representative Office in Shanghai and this was 
opened in October 2022. 
During the year we combined currency, crypto, 
and commodity into one business pillar, 
leveraging our infrastructure, insights and 
expertise to drive value across these asset 
classes, using their natural connection to 
enhance capabilities and drive the segment 
forward as a whole. We also branched out into 
liquidity provisions for tokens, successfully 
manoeuvred the ETH merge, and drove growth 
through the creation of a global commodity 
strategy. Our robust and proactive risk 
management procedures and approach meant 
that we were able to navigate the volatility in 
the crypto markets, particularly around the 
events surrounding the collapse of FTX.
We further built upon our successful Fixed 
Income business, continuing to leverage the 
accelerating trends towards electronication and 
algorithmic trading, as well as fostering the low 
vs high touch trading model which is something 
Flow Traders is well positioned to support. We 
were the exclusive partner for BondBloxx to 
launch their range of Fixed Income ETPs in the 
US, retained our top-five dealer status on 
Bloomberg in Europe, and were once again lead 
sponsor of the main Fixed Income Leadership 
Summit.
Overall, our dedication to pricing excellence and 
innovative proprietary trading infrastructure 
further enhanced our proposition across all 
asset classes.
We formalized the creation of our venture 
capital unit, Flow Traders Capital. This is a 
dedicated €50 million fund to actively invest in 
the development of financial markets 
infrastructure and the digital asset space. Flow 
Traders Capital makes direct minority 
investments, across all geographies, with an 
emphasis on three key themes: platform, data, 
and connectivity and in 2022 we completed 16 
investments, in organizations such as D2X, 
Elwood and Thalex.

Governance and regulatory 
In October 2022, following a thorough legal and 
capital structure review, Flow Traders 
announced its intention to update its corporate 
holding structure which was approved by an 
overwhelming majority of the shareholders on 2 
December 2022. The change in jurisdiction for 
the top holding company to Bermuda resulted in 
different regulatory capital requirements and 
seeks to create a more level playing field with 
competitors globally. This in turn supports Flow 
Traders to accelerate our growth strategy and 
achieve our ambitions. The implementation of 
the new top holding was completed on 13 
January 2023 and and Flow Traders Ltd. became 
our top holding company. As a result, Flow 
Traders installed a one-tier board structure, 
composed of executive and non-executive 
directors and updated its governance 
documents to reflect the necessary changes 
pursuant to the update while mimicking as 
much as reasonably possible the previous 
governance arrangements. 
We foresee that EU financial market regulations 
will be further reviewed through 2023, and we 
look to engage where we believe Flow Traders 
can make a valuable contribution. The Markets 
in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) is a particular 
focus area for the business, as it heads into the 
final stage of the legislative process after the 
political agreement at the end of 2022, and the 
introduction of a consolidated tape for the 
European capital market as part of the Markets 
in Financial Instruments regulation review 
(MiFIR).
Financial overview
Flow Traders delivered an improved financial 
and trading performance in 2022 compared to 
2021 reflecting a more active market 
environment. We recorded Normalized Total 
Income in 2022 of €460.6 million and 
demonstrated a healthy Normalized EBITDA 
margin of 45% with Normalized EBITDA of 
€208.2m. Ultimately, we recorded a Normalized 
Net Profit of €150.2m with Normalized Basic 
EPS of €3.45. This, along with our strong capital 
position, allowed the company to pay a total 
dividend of €1.50 per share to shareholders.
Farewell to Dennis Dijkstra 
On 31 January 2023, Dennis Dijkstra stepped 
down as CEO of Flow Traders after fourteen 
years with the company and eight years as CEO. 
Under his entrepreneurial leadership, Flow 
Traders has become one of the world’s leading 
liquidity providers and we would like to express 
our deepest gratitude to Dennis. He has been a 
key contributor to creating the unique Flow 
Traders spirit that thrives across the business, 
and which will continue to be a part of the 
company culture and a key factor to our 
success. On behalf of everyone at Flow Traders, 
we wish him every success with his future 
endeavours. 
Looking ahead 
Finally, we would like to recognize our people 
and their incredible efforts in 2022. Our talented 
and vibrant team make Flow Traders a special 
place to work and they have been key to the 
success of the business. The journey ahead is 
an exciting one and we would like to thank our 
people, shareholders and other stakeholders for 
their support and contribution.

Our profile
Who we are
Flow Traders is a leading global financial technology-
enabled liquidity provider in a wide range of financial 
products, historically specialized in Exchange Traded 
Products (ETPs), now successfully expanded across 
multiple asset classes. Flow Traders ensures the 
provision of liquidity to support the uninterrupted 
functioning of financial markets. This allows 
investors to continue to buy or sell ETPs or other 
financial instruments under all market 
circumstances. We continuously grow our 
organization, ensuring that our trading desks in 
Europe, the Americas and Asia can provide liquidity 
across all major exchanges and trading platforms, 
globally, 24 hours a day. Founded in 2004, we 
continue to cultivate the entrepreneurial, innovative 
and team-oriented culture that has been with us 
since the beginning.
What we do
We are a financial technology company operating in 
the global financial markets, using our proprietary 
technology platform to provide liquidity by quoting 
bid and ask prices in thousands of financial products. 
Flow Traders ensures the provision of this liquidity to 
support the uninterrupted functioning of financial 
markets. Our core trading focus is on exchange-
traded products (ETPs) and we do this globally, 
enabling investors to buy and sell ETPs efficiently by 
quoting bid and ask prices under virtually all market 
circumstances. 
We provide this liquidity via two main routes: “on 
screen” which is conducted on stock exchanges 
where Flow Traders is a registered market maker in 
ETPs and “off exchange” where we trade bilaterally 
with institutional counterparties, often through 
Request for Quote (RfQ) platforms such as those 
operated by Tradeweb, MarketAxess and Bloomberg. 
More recently, we have diversified our market 
making activities across multiple asset classes, such 
as fixed income, cryptocurrency, Foreign Exchange 
(FX), and commodity. 
Flow Traders’ group companies can be found in Note 
33 in the Financial Statements.

Products
Exchange-traded products (ETPs)
ETPs, the main products that we trade, are often 
compared to mutual funds largely because they are 
both baskets of shares, bonds, or commodities. 
However, that is where the similarity ends. Unlike 
most mutual funds, the majority of ETPs simply 
track an index without trying to outperform such 
indices. ETPs have open-ended fund structures 
rather than closed-end and, unlike mutual funds, 
can be continuously bought and sold on trading 
venues during trading hours and off-exchange at all 
times. ETPs provide investors with exposure to a 
wide variety of underlying assets, ranging from ETPs 
that replicate the composition of a particular equity 
index, to those that provide investors with exposure 
to assets in specific sectors or countries, to 
commodities, or to currencies. ETPs also enable 
investors to create and manage diversified 
investment portfolios in an efficient manner, as well 
as enabling them to switch exposures at any given 
moment during trading days. There are broadly 
three main categories within ETPs in which we trade: 
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
This category is the most traded, when compared to 
ETCs and ETNs. ETFs derive their value from shares 
or bonds held in proportion to an index. For 
example, a Euro Stoxx 50 ETF would hold the same 
shares as the Euro Stoxx 50 index, in approximately 
the same proportions. Fixed-income ETFs derive 
their value from a portfolio of debt instruments. For 
example, bonds included in the Barclays US 
Treasury 1-3 Year Term Index. ETFs are the most 
widespread among ETPs as measured by Assets 
under Management (AuM).
Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)
ETCs typically derive their value from a commodity 
index, such as the Bloomberg Commodity Index, 
although in some cases they derive it from just a 
single commodity, such as gold or oil, or a certain 
currency. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares ETC 
tracks the value of physical gold. ETCs may hold 
physical assets, but exposure can also be held 
through derivatives of the underlying commodity, in 
combination with cash.
Exchange-traded notes (ETNs)
ETNs are types of unsecured, unsubordinated debt 
securities issued by an underwriting bank. The 
returns of ETNs are based on the performance of the 
index being tracked. For example, the iPath S&P 500 
VIX Short-Term Futures Index TR ETN would track 
the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures volatility index.
The ETP ecosystem
The ETP ecosystem is made up of a number of 
participants who together make ETP investing and 
trading possible. These include investors, ETP 
issuers, exchanges and other trading venues and 
authorized participants, who can also act as liquidity 
providers, such as Flow Traders. The ETP ecosystem 
can be further divided into two markets: the primary 
market and the secondary market.
Primary market
Interaction in the primary market takes place 
between authorized participants (APs) and the 
issuers, who either issue or cancel ETPs. This is done 
in reaction to market demand and is called the 
creation and redemption process. APs can create 
ETPs with the issuer by transferring the underlying 
assets (or cash equivalent) to the issuer in return for 
a corresponding number of newly issued ETPs.
In this way, the issuance of ETPs through APs 
provides the issuers with access to a broad investor 
market without having to support a complex and 
costly trading infrastructure which would be non-
core to their business. Redemption is the reverse of 
the creation process: the AP transfers ETPs to their 
issuer in exchange for the underlying assets (or a 
cash equivalent). The issuer then cancels the ETPs it 
received. 
Secondary market
The secondary market is where ETP trading takes 
place between market participants, similar to the 
trading of ordinary shares, at market-determined 
prices. Secondary market participants include 
institutional and retail investors, liquidity providers 
and APs. Secondary markets include exchanges and 
other automated trading venues, as well as off-
exchange trading between market participants such 
as large institutional investor.

Our business is aligned to three distinct 
asset classes and underlying focus 
groups.
Equity
At present, Flow Traders provides liquidity within the 
Equity space solely in ETPs and associated index 
products. We traded these Equity products globally 
utilising our three trading hubs in Europe, Asia and 
Americas.
Fixed income
The fixed income markets in particular have been 
experiencing a wave of electronification which is 
expanding the opportunities available to non-bank 
liquidity providers such as Flow Traders.
Flow Traders provides liquidity in fixed income ETPs 
as well as cash bonds (investment grade and high 
yield corporate credit and emerging market 
sovereigns) in Europe, the Americas and Asia. We 
have held a long-standing strong position within the 
fixed income ETP space. Our cash bonds proposition 
was launched in 2021 and was further expanded and 
built out through the course of 2022 both in terms of 
ISIN coverage, counterparty onboarding as well as 
RfQ platform connectivity. Fixed income is a key 
strategic growth area for the business.
Currency, Crypto and Commodity (CCC)
Flow Traders started providing liquidity in FX as a 
separate asset class during 2018. We provide 
liquidity in an increasing number of FX pairs on spot 
and futures in the EMEA and APAC markets to a fast-
growing number of counterparties on an expanding 
number of platforms, including Bloomberg’s FX 
platform. In addition, we naturally also provide 
liquidity in FX ETPs. 
Flow Traders also provides liquidity across the digital 
asset space which include cryptocurrency ETPs, 
futures and spot, which we consider to be a key part 
of our broader CCC proposition. This is a growing 
part of our overall business and is also a key 
strategic focus. 
In commodities in general, Flow Traders has always 
been active in the ETP market as well as the 
underlying asset classes. This also includes 
commodity futures and spot products.

Pricing
Pricing fast and accurately
Being able to accurately and rapidly price the 
various financial products that we provide liquidity in 
is vital to the success of our business. Get it wrong, 
and we risk not winning the trade or losing money 
due to bad pricing. Our experience in establishing 
the pricing and hedging relationships across different 
products in a variety of market conditions means we 
can offer competitive bid and ask prices, while still 
covering our trading and hedging costs while 
achieving a transaction profit. We achieve this using 
pre-set hedging strategies, which, when possible, 
instantly reduce our market exposure, creating a 
market-neutral position. This approach is also taken 
with respect to providing liquidity in the various 
asset classes we trade such as cryptocurrency and 
corporate credit.
Cutting edge proprietary technology 
platform
Developing software in-house 
We are a technology-enabled company operating in 
the financial markets space. As such, technology 
truly lies at the core of our business, enabling us to 
provide liquidity in a variety of market environments 
across the globe. We trade using proprietary and 
scalable software with the vast majority of our 
applications developed in-house. These include 
pricing and trading software, market data processing 
tools, pre-trade risk controls, and other risk and 
compliance tools. This is the main reason that our 
technology department makes up 40 percent of our 
FTEs and is our largest employee group.
One of our software platform’s core features is its 
modular design, which allows us to rapidly test and 
implement ongoing enhancements. This also means 
we can easily and cost-effectively expand our 
coverage of securities, asset classes, trading 
platforms and geographical markets as we grow the 
business.
In 2022 our total technology expenses increased by 
23 percent versus 2021 as we invested further in the 
trading business. Our technology expenses 
represented 35 percent of our total fixed expenses 
and the number of technology FTEs grew to 262 in 
2022 from 244 in 2021, in order to support the 
execution of our growth strategy.

Dividend policy and dividend 
proposal 
Dividend policy
Flow Traders intends to pay dividends annually in 
two instalments, with a target aggregate dividend 
pay-out ratio of at least 50 percent of the company’s 
net profits realized during the financial year. The  
Board may decide that the profits realized during a 
financial year will fully or partially be appropriated to 
increase and/or form reserves. A distribution of 
(interim) dividends is subject to applicable rules and 
regulations, the Bye-laws of the company, and the 
Board Rules.
It is anticipated that our interim dividends will be 
declared and paid following the publication of our 
results for the first half of each year. However, there 
can be no assurance that in any given year a 
dividend will be proposed or declared.
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts 
and timing thereof will depend on a number of 
factors, including legal and regulatory requirements, 
future profits, financial conditions, general economic 
and business conditions, future prospects and such 
other factors as the Board may deem relevant. Our 
intentions in relation to dividends are subject to 
numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, 
many of which may be beyond our control.
The Board may decide to make allocations to 
reserves and therefore decides how much of the 
profit will be allocated to reserves. The profits 
remaining shall be put forward at the disposal of the 
General Meeting (subject to a change of the Bye-
laws which will be proposed at our upcoming general 
meeting in 2023). 
Reserves and dividend proposal for the financial 
year 2022 Pursuant to Bye-law 33.1, the Board has 
decided that of the profit for 2022 (totalling €126.8 
million), an amount of €64.9 million shall be added 
to the reserves. The remaining amount of €61.9 
million is at the disposal of the General Meeting 
(subject to a change of the Bye-laws which will be 
proposed at our upcoming general meeting in 2023).
It will be proposed to the General Meeting (subject 
to a change of the Bye-laws which will be proposed 
at our upcoming general meeting in 2023) that a 
total cash dividend of €1.50 per share will be paid 
out to shareholders for the financial year 2022, 
subject to a 15 percent dividend withholding tax 
(dividendbelasting). An interim cash dividend of 
€0.70 per share was paid out on 19 August 2022. 
This means that the final cash dividend proposal to 
the General Meeting is €0.80 per share. Subject to

change of the Bye-laws which will be proposed at 
our upcoming general meeting in 2023) on 26 April 
2023. Shares will trade ex-dividend on 28 April

Value creation and strategy
We create value in a number of financial 
and non-financial ways for a variety of 
stakeholders. Supported by our 
proprietary technology platform, we 
provide liquidity in financial products 
that helps contribute to more efficient 
markets by lowering overall trading 
costs, delivering greater execution 
quality and market transparency. For 
our employees, we provide a compelling 
and constantly evolving work 
environment that enables them to 
develop to their full potential. We take 
an active interest in the societies in 
which we operate, contributing to local 
learning initiatives and charities 
through the Flow Traders Foundation. 
And we care for our investors by 
focusing on growing profitably and 
providing dividend returns. Our value 
creation model shows how we create 
value and the impact our business has 
on our stakeholders.
Our ambition and strategy 
Our purpose and ambition
We are the driving force for an investment 
environment that is more transparent, efficient and 
lower-cost for end-investors, through the power of 
trading acumen, innovation and talent.
Our market and environment
We operate in a highly dynamic world, where 
globalization and technological development are 
continuing to accelerate the pace of change. In 
addition, we see certain mega trends which are 
more specifically shaping the future of the financial 
markets:
▪
Rise of passive investing with significantly 
growing assets under management with 
Blackrock estimating that ETP AuM will double by 
2025 compared to 2020
▪
Increasing electronification of trading across fixed 
income and other asset classes
▪
Growth in digital assets and institutional adoption 
as well development of new large liquidity pools
▪
Emerging ecosystems adapting to shifting trends 
and driving venture capital and private equity 
investments
▪
Ever developing regulatory landscape which 
creates greater transparency and a more level 
playing field
The markets’ core functions remains the same: 
transferring risk between various market 
participants. This is where we add value. 
Accordingly, our focus will continue to be on 
providing liquidity in more and more products in the 
financial markets across multiple asset classes, 
building on our status as an ETP powerhouse. We 
also are seeking to be a driver and accelerator of 
change in the financial markets through our 
dedicated corporate venture capital unit, Flow 
Traders Capital.
Our business principles
Our business principles are being flexible, agile and 
focused on continuous improvements. To be 
successful, we recognize that we need to perform 
well across all areas of the business. Achieving this 
involves diligently studying the markets and our 
responses to them, and using our resources where 
they have the greatest impact. The outcome of this 
process defines whether or not we have a 
competitive edge.
Our strategy 
We will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing 
to grow our business through our dedicated multi-
year diversification strategy. Here we have 
expanded, and will continue to expand, on our 
market leading position in ETPs with growth in Fixed 
Income, Digital Assets, FX, and Commodities. This 
should result in structurally increasing our Net 
Trading Income (NTI), while increasing the resilience 
of the business and also maintaining our desired risk 
profile, controlling costs, and securing and attracting 
the right talent. 
Increasing our NTI involves increasing the product of 
volume and the net margin we capture per trade, 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   17


---

## Page 18

where volume is the value of products we trade and 
the net margin is the margin we capture per trade 
after the corresponding exposure has been hedged. 
Our risk profile is characterized by having no 
directional opinion on the market. In other words, 
our results do not depend on the direction of market 
prices. By expanding our presence as a liquidity 
provider across multiple asset classes, Flow Traders 
can maximize the growth of its NTI. 
By growing our presence in the global financial 
market as a liquidity provider and as an agent of 
change, we build a foundation to support our long-
term growth trend. By growing our presence in 
underlying asset classes, we expect to improve our 
performance in the future, including during those 
periods where the trading activity in the market may 
slow down. Our investments through Flow Traders 
Capital are expected to not only generate a financial 
return but also drive business growth as we drive 
innovation across the global financial markets. In 
this sense, we believe we are on the journey to 
becoming a next generation liquidity provider.
Our strategy is firmly aligned with our ESG ambition 
and mission. Growing our presence in the financial 
markets through expanding and deepening our ETP 
trading footprint as well as improving pricing and 
access to fixed income, commodity and FX liquidity 
will only make markets more efficient and reduce 
trading costs for end-investors globally. It will also 
enable the financing of the shift towards a 
sustainable world economy. 
Moreover, in order to drive forward our growth 
agenda we rely on the talent and integrity of all 
colleagues at Flow Traders in line with our focus on 
business ethics and creating sustainable 
employment.
Becoming a leading global multi-asset 
liquidity provider
We believe there are six elements of our strategic 
ambition which will drive Flow Traders in its goal to 
becoming a leading global multi-asset liquidity 
provider:
▪
Global access - providing liquidity any time 
anywhere across trading venues, exchanges and 
to institutional counterparties
▪
Asset universe - trading any asset to expand our 
presence in ETPs and grow in the underlying 
asset classes
▪
Pricing excellence - acting as a market neutral 
provider 24/5 with strong hedging capabilities for 
low risk in all asset classes
▪
Proprietary cutting edge technology - benefiting 
from automated, low-touch trading infrastructure 
for seamless execution
▪
Talented team - leveraging experienced talent 
pool that forms an open, diverse and 
entrepreneurial team
▪
Ecosystem innovation - shaping financial markets 
through venture capital investments and 
partnerships with leading players

Markets and trends
Our business
In 2022 we had access to more than 180 trading 
venues in 40 countries around the world. We provide 
liquidity in over 8,000 ETP listings on- and off-
exchange, which is around 60 percent of all ETPs 
globally.
Off-exchange, we provide liquidity in ETPs on a 
request-for-quote basis to more than 2,200 
institutional counterparties across the globe, 
including banks, asset managers, pension funds, 
insurance companies, family offices, hedge funds, 
and others and this number is increasing on an 
almost daily basis. 
In addition to ETPs we provide liquidity in similar 
instruments whose value is correspondingly affected 
by a change in the value of underlying or related 
assets, such as futures or bonds. 
During 2022, we continued to implement our 
dedicated diversification initiatives across other 
asset classes and provided liquidity as a market 
maker in FX, fixed income, commodities and 
cryptocurrency.
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider 
we generally do not have a directional opinion on the 
market. In other words, our results do not depend 
on the direction of market prices. Our NTI is realized 
through the small price differences that are realized 
between buying and selling related or correlating 
assets. Whether that is between the ETPs we buy or 
sell, and the prices we pay or receive for the 
underlying or related financial instruments to 
mitigate our risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager 
and do not have our own Assets under Management 
(AuM). We also do not develop or make products, do 
not provide any services and do not have 
(consumer) clients. Our value chain comprises, 
among others, of our institutional counterparties, 
prime brokers and regulators. 
ETPs
In recent years, the ETP ecosystem has continued to 
mature and experience significant growth in both 
Assets under Management (AuM) and number of 
products. According to ETFGI, global ETP AuM 
declined from €9,030 billion by the end of 2021 to 
€8,143 billion by the end of 2022. This a reflection 
mainly of the underlying market performance during 
2022 and the expectation is that AuM will grow 
going forward, We believe there are a number of 
reasons for this expected trend, including beyond 
2023: one is that investors are attracted to the 
transparent nature of ETPs, which enables them to 
follow clearly how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid 
and available at low-cost and can be bought and 
sold easily during market hours. A third reason is 
that ETPs can be composed of financial instruments 
from almost any asset class, sector or location, 
providing investors access to markets that would 
normally be difficult to reach.
Review of 2022 
Global ETP markets shrank by 10% percent in 2022, 
as measured by AuM, driven predominantly by the 
performance of the underlying markets. Annual 
global inflows of ETP AuM were €818 billion in 2022 
(2021: €1,138 billion  – source ETFGI). Overall 
trading activity in 2022 increased as the markets 
absorbed the outbreak of the Russian - Ukraine 
conflict as well as interest rate and inflation 
increases alongside the continued high levels of 
retail investor activity, particularly in the US.

Global coverage
Flow Traders operates three main trading hubs in 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and New York. In addition, 
we operate various branch or representative offices 
around the world in London, Milan, Paris and 
Shanghai. In November 2022, we announced the 
receipt of regulatory approval to open a 
representative office in Shanghai. This is consistent 
with Flow Traders’ growth strategy to deepen its 
geographical footprint and it will enable us to 
increase our proximity to institutional counterparties 
in specific markets.
In 2022, Flow Traders ETP value traded once again 
was in excess of the €1 trillion mark. The largest ETP 
market globally remains in the United States, where 
total ETP value traded (on-exchange and off-
exchange) was €44.7 trillion in 2022. Our New York 
office’s total ETP value traded was €892 billion in 
2022, markedly higher than in 2021 and, for the 
fourth year in a row, a record year for Flow Traders 
US since inception. With institutional trading gaining 
further momentum in 2022, Flow Traders US 
continued to grow and deepen its overall presence in 
this important market. We also expanded our Lead 
Market Maker activities during 2022 and accordingly 
supported numerous ETF listings in the United 
States for a variety of leading issuers. Our strategic 
investment in Members Exchange (MEMX) underlines 
our long-term commitment to the US equities 
ecosystem as we seek to grow our business and 
presence further. The EMEA ETP market had a total 
ETP value traded of €2.4 trillion in 2022. Our total 
ETP value traded from our Europe offices was €787 
billion in 2022. We remained the number one 
liquidity provider in ETPs in EMEA and managed to 
grow our on- and off-exchange presence further. In 
APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with 
large differences in trading volumes, trading costs, 
regulation and maturity across the financial markets.
The APAC ETP market had a total ETP value traded 
of €4.8 trillion in 2022, including China, while the 
total ETP value traded at our APAC offices was €95.8 
billion. Flow Traders had a successful year in 2022 in 
APAC in terms of trading volumes, confirming the 
contribution of specific recent investments made in 
the region. In 2022, Flow Traders was awarded Best 
ETF Market Maker by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and 
received the Top Market Maker - ETP Coverage 
award from the HKEX for Flow Traders' contribution 
to the ETF market. Flow Traders is currently a 
market maker in more than 200 ETPs on HKEX. In 
addition, there was an expansion of Flow Traders’ 
ETP trading footprint in APAC through receipt of a 
QFII licence in China and by becoming an official 
market maker on ASX and CBOE Australia in 55 
tickers.
Equity
We still see significant opportunities for growth in 
the equity ETP market, which is the main focus of 
the Equity business at Flow Traders. Global Equity 
ETP value traded increased to €26.1 trillion in 2022 
and further market growth is expected to due 
increasing investor demand and awareness for the 
product.
Flow Traders Equity value traded (ETPs, Futures and 
Cash) amounted to €3,349 billion in 2022.
Flow Traders strengths and future focus relating to 
Equity include:
▪
Market leader in EMEA ETPs consistently with 
26.8% overall market share and 41% market 
share on-exchange
▪
Strong performance globally in International ETPs 
and Index Futures
▪
Domestic ETPs build-out dependent on single-
stock competencies (particularly in the United 
States)
▪
Leveraging of global pricing capabilities in Asia as 
we penetrate and unlock new growth markets
Fixed Income
Electronic trading has increased dramatically over 
the last few years. For example, 45% of Euro-
denominated investment-grade (IG) credit is now 
executed electronically, reaching 75% on a ticket-
count basis. The COVID-19 pandemic has only 
further accelerated this trend with the buy-side 
favouring the use of RfQ platforms to an even 
greater extent. This increase has contributed to the 
approaching inflection point of electronification in 
credit markets, comparable to what we have 
witnessed in other markets, such as foreign 
exchange (FX), US equity options and exchange-
traded funds (ETFs). This transition is being driven 
by better pre- and post-trade information, the rise of 
algorithmic trading and new trading protocols being 
embraced by the buy- and sell-side. Initially driven 
by regulation such as MiFID II, it is likely that the 
regulatory landscape will continue to accelerate this 
electronification trend. 
Responding to these market dynamics, Flow Traders 
has built a strong fixed income liquidity provision 
capability set spanning ETPs, corporate credit 
(investment grade and high yield bonds) and 
emerging market sovereigns. 
There has been a consistent increase in fixed income 
ETP value traded in recent years as well as AuM 
Indeed in 2022, Global Fixed Income ETP value 
traded increased to €3.0 trillion.
Flow Traders Fixed Income value traded (ETPs, 
Futures and Cash) amounted to €1,323 billion in 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   21

## Page 22

2022, which is a significant increase over 2021 
(€1,036 billion) as we deepen and broaden our 
market coverage and our offering gains traction with 
the buyside.
From a strategic standpoint, Flow Traders strategic 
focus areas include:
▪
ETP ecosystem - partner with issuers to develop 
innovative fixed income products. We are also 
seeking creation-redemption synergies with 
corporate bond market making
▪
Credit trading - will increase quote sizes to 
undertake larger block transactions with 
counterparties as well as distributing pre-trade 
portfolio trading levels to expedite portfolio 
construction
▪
Model pricing - expand model trading capabilities 
to new fixed income subsets and improve pricing 
and coverage of investment grade bonds
Currency, Cryptocurrency and 
Commodity (CCC)
In recent years, cryptocurrency has emerged as an 
important asset class with increased institutional 
acceptance. The crypto markets have experienced 
significant volatility during 2022 with digital 
currencies experiencing material price declines. For 
example, the price of Bitcoin decreased by 64% in 
2022 and Ethereum by 68%. Trading volumes also 
experienced corresponding reductions with Bitcoin 
average daily volume in Q4 2022 21% lower than 
Q4 2021. The development of institutional grade and 
regulated digital asset market infrastructure 
continued to progress in 2022, namely in custody 
solutions, prime brokerage, data and analytics, AML-
KYC and other risk solutions, digital property rights, 
digital identity solutions as well as DEFI ecosystems. 
Crypto ETPs are another clear example of regulatory 
and investor acceptance of digital assets. They solve 
liquidity and custody issues many investors, both 
retail and institutional, face by having an exchange-
listed instrument with registered market makers 
providing liquidity under all market circumstances. 
Flow Traders’ crypto liquidity provision commenced 
5 years ago and spans OTC spot as well as ETPs. We 
are connected to 20 trading venues globally and 
trade 300 coins. From an ETP perspective, Flow 
Traders is the number 1 liquidity provider in crypto 
ETPs in Europe with a circa 45% market share and 
has a 27% market share globally on exchange. The 
digital assets space is well suited to Flow Traders’ 
technology-enabled capabilities.

The volatility evident in the crypto markets in 2022 
with the onset of the "crypto winter" and the 
collapse of FTX digital assets trading platform has 
not altered our conviction around the long term 
potential of crypto and decentralised finance both 
from a trading as well as a technological and 
financial markets innovation standpoint. With Flow 
Traders' generally market neutral approach, we 
continuously provided liquidity across these markets 
in throughout 2022 which once again highlights our 
trading capabilities, strong risk framework and 
consistently improving technology stack.
The future focus and opportunities for digital assets 
include:
▪
ETPs - maintain our leading position in crypto 
ETP market making with prospect of further 
regional expansion while at the same time 
working to increase efficiency of access across 
the ecosystem
▪
Spot and derivatives - continue to grow market 
making business across these products by 
expanding platform and token coverage
▪
Strategic partnerships - leverage new and 
existing partnerships to build out further the 
trading infrastructure around digital assets. Work 
with Flow Traders Capital to embed Flow Traders 
further into the overall ecosystem

Our performance
Flow Traders delivered an improved 
financial and trading performance in 2022 
compared to 2021 reflecting a more active 
market environment. We recorded 
Normalized Total Income in 2022 of €460.6 
million (2021: €387.1 million). Significant 
operational highlights included the 
continued growth of our fixed income 
proposition, broadening and deepening our 
equity ETP trading footprint, as well as 
resilience in the digital assets markets. A 
key strategic milestone was the successful 
the update of our corporate holding 
structure.
Financial overview 
Total income
The market environment in 2022 was more active 
compared to 2021 as the markets and investors 
reacted to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as the 
changing macro environment as rising interest rates 
and inflation affected the global economy. Volatility 
in 2022 was on average higher than seen in 2021 as 
measured by the VIX index (25.98 vs 19.88). 
Given this market backdrop and our leading global 
trading footprint, Flow Traders total value traded in 
2022 grew to €6.8 trillion (2021: €5.7 trillion), of 
which €1.8 trillion (2021: €1.5 trillion) was traded in 
ETPs (on-exchange and off-exchange). The rest was 
traded in related financial products to facilitate 
competitive pricing in ETPs as well trading in other 
asset classes, such as fixed income, FX and 
cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, ETP market value traded 
(on-exchange and off-exchange) also increased 
during the same period to €51.8 trillion (2021: 
€36.8 trillion).
The market environment Normalized total income of 
€460.6 million in 2022 (2021: €387.1 million), 
comprising Normalized Net Trading Income (NTI) of 
€459.5 million (2021: €384.0 million) and €1.1 
million of other income from unrealized gains in our 
growing portfolio of strategic investments (2021:
€3.1 million) - the second most successful year for 
Flow Traders. Europe, our home market, contributed 
the most to our NTI which reflects that region’s high 
level of flow visibility and counterparty and product 
coverage. There was also significant contributions 
from the US and APAC. During 2022, we were able 
to successfully leverage our recent dedicated efforts 
to diversify our trading activities across various 
asset classes and products.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, Flow Traders reported 
Normalized total income of €113.9 million which 
reflected generally higher activity levels in the 
markets as well as the growing resilience and 
trading diversification of the business.
Market volatility
In 2022 market volatility increased from the levels 
witnessed in 2021. The main volatility took place 
during October, May and June with average VIX 
levels of 30.37, 29.98, and 28.56 respectively.
Operational expenses
On the cost side, Normalized fixed operating 
expenses increased to €161.6 million in 2022 (2021: 
€122.1 million). The main drivers of the increase in 
fixed expenses related to USD strengthening, base 
compensation increases, technology investments to 
support diversification initiatives as well as new 
hires. FTEs increased by 8 percent to 660. 
Normalized variable employee expenses increased to 
€90.8 million (2021: €86.5 million) which reflects 
the improved overall financial performance of the 
business during the year and the adjusted profit 
sharing percentage of 32.5% (2021: 35%) which 
was implemented to ensure the base compensation 
increases were income statement neutral.
Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
continued to demonstrate strong operational 
leverage with a Normalized EBITDA margin of 45% 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   25

## Page 26

in 2022 (2021: 46%) with Normalized EBITDA of 
€208.2 million (2021: €178.5 million).
Normalized Performance: IFRS 
Reconciliation
Flow Traders makes certain adjustments to various 
IFRS expense and profit measures to derive an 
Alternative Performance Measures (APM). The policy 
is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to 
be significant in both nature or size and where the 
treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders 
with useful information to assess the year-on-year 
or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On 
this basis, the following items were adjusted or 
excluded for the 2022 results reporting:
▪
Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based 
payments which include the deferral of a portion 
of the current year share plans as well as 
recognition of prior years’ share plans. This 
adjustment provides insights into the relationship 
between the current year variable employee 
expenses and current year trading performance.
▪
Other income line includes all the realized and 
unrealized results on Flow Traders’ long-term 
equity investments whether accounted for as Fair 
Value Other Comprehensive Income (FV OCI), 
Fair Value Profit and Loss (FVPL) or Results of 
Equity-accounted Investments.
▪
Exclusion of strategic advisory costs as one-off 
expenses in 2022 in relation to optimization of 
the Group legal entity and regulatory structure 
and further balance sheet review efforts.
▪
Tax expenses are adjusted based upon the pre-
tax adjustments and/or excluded items above.

Capital base and dividends
During the year we continued to maintain a strong, 
stable capital base, comfortably exceeding both our 
regulatory and prime broker capital requirements. 
We paid out a €0.70 interim dividend in August 2022 
and propose to pay €0.80 as a final dividend over 
2022. Over the course of 2022 we therefore aim to 
return a total of €1.50 per share through dividends 
to our shareholders, which represents a 51% (2021: 
51%) percent dividend pay-out ratio.
As at 31 December 2022 our regulatory capital 
requirements under IFR/IFD were €274 million. As 
Flow Traders’ total regulatory capital stood at €538 
million, this resulted in an excess capital position of 
€264 million. Trading capital stood at €651.0 million 
at the end of 2022 (€610.6 million as at 31 
December 2021).
Cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities decreased to 
€93.8 million in 2022 (2021: €244.8 million in 
2021). Cash flows from operating activities in 2021 
were at an elevated level due to dividend funding 
and share repurchases.  
Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to 
€19.7 million in 2022 (2021: €13.8 million) as 
additional strategic investments were made through 
the newly established Flow Traders Capital alongside 
continued investment in the business. Lastly, cash 
outflows from financing activities in 2022 amounted 
to €70.6 million (2021: €234.6 million) as dividends 
and share buybacks reduced year over year. 
Growth
We continued to grow our global team, trading 
strategies and infrastructure in 2022. We increased 
our institutional counterparty base globally to over 
2,200 as well as being connected to over 180 
trading venues. To facilitate this growth, we 
continued to grow the business during the year 
across all regions, resulting in an increase in the 
number of FTEs to 660 by year-end (2021: 613).
Outlook
While Flow Traders remains committed to bringing 
onboard additional talent in growth business areas, 
FTEs are expected to remain broadly flat during 
2023 given expected efficiency gains. There is a 
strong commitment to maintain the fixed operating 
cost base in line with the December 2022 run-rate. 
Accordingly, normalized fixed operating expenses in 
2023 are expected to amount to c. €175 - €185 
million compared to €161.6 million in 2022.
Flow Traders will remain focused on all arising 
opportunities to create shareholder value through 
systematic capital management going forward.

Our ESG focus areas
▪
Business integrity
Being able to act with honesty and being 
consistent in whatever it is you are doing based 
on the particular moral value or belief compass 
you have. For Flow Traders this implies 
conducting business within a framework of laws 
and regulations, high ethical standards, 
respecting human rights and own policies and 
procedures. See page 34
▪
Liquidity in financial markets
Providing liquidity to global financial markets to 
promote fair, transparent and stable markets. 
Flow Traders ensures the provision of liquidity to 
support the uninterrupted functioning of financial 
markets. The provision of this liquidity allows 
investors to continue to buy or sell ETPs or other 
financial instruments under all market 
circumstances. See pages 34-35
▪
Good corporate governance
Pursuing the highest standards of good corporate 
governance to make sure we take actions that 
have a beneficial effect on all our stakeholders. 
Corporate governance is the system of rules, 
practices, and processes by which a firm is 
directed and controlled and essentially involves 
balancing the interests of a company’s many 
stakeholders, such as shareholders, senior 
management executives, customers, suppliers, 
financiers, the government, and the community. 
See page 35
▪
Diversity and inclusion
Pursuing a diverse and inclusive business. 
Diversity is defined as the range of human 
differences, including but not limited to race, 
ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual 
orientation, age, social class, physical ability or 
attributes, religious or ethical values system, 
national origin, and political beliefs. Inclusion is 
defined as involvement and empowerment, 
where the inherent worth and dignity of all 
people are recognized. For Flow Traders it implies 
being a truly equal opportunity employer, by 
recruiting, retaining and promoting people based 
on merit, and merit alone. See page 35-36
▪
Sustainable employment
Creating a context that contributes to sustainable 
employment, which refers to the extent to which 
workers are able and willing to remain working 
for Flow Traders. Flow Traders creates such a 
context by offering high-quality jobs, developing 
talent in-house, maintaining a substantial 
employee shareholder base, offering variable 
remuneration which allows employees to share in 
the success of Flow Traders and creating and 
maintaining high-quality jobs in the places where 
we conduct business. See pages 36-41
▪
Fair taxation
Pursuing the principle that tax should follow the 
business. Consequently Flow Traders pays taxes 
where profits are earned in accordance with local 
tax legislation. We aim to comply with domestic 
and international tax laws and also the standards 
set by the OECD Guidelines. Flow Traders is 
aware that its business, including our approach 
to tax, has an impact on society. See pages 
41-42
▪
Societal commitments and charities
Supporting charitable initiatives and engaging in 
community giving, not only financially but also by 
offering access to our knowledge and experience. 
A key part of this support will be through the 
Flow Traders Foundation which was established 
in 2020. See pages 43
▪
Stakeholder engagement
Engaging with stakeholders that may be affected 
by decisions and giving stakeholders the 
opportunity to influence decision making 
processes through extensive stakeholder 
dialogue. See pages 43-44
▪
Carbon emissions, material use and waste
Reducing the amount of carbon we emit through 
energy consumption and travel as well as 
reducing the amount of materials we use and 
waste at our offices which consists of stationary 
products and general household waste. Flow 
Traders does this e.g. by sourcing sustainably, 
video conferencing, buying green energy, limiting 
the amount of food wasted during lunches and 
separating waste. See pages 44-45

Shared value
Flow Traders was founded more than 15 years ago, 
and in that time we have developed an innovative 
and entrepreneurial spirit that enables us to grow 
and explore new markets. We recognize that with 
this growth come responsibilities that go beyond our 
core business, and that our activities influence the 
society in which we live and operate. 
At the same time, society has a very real impact on 
our business and operations. Both the Executive 
Committee and the Board pay close attention to a 
wide variety of developments and trends that could 
pose either a risk or an opportunity and in 2022 the 
COVID-19 pandemic was still relevant as such an 
event. Another is the opportunity that comes with 
the shift to digitalization, which is helping make 
financial products and services more widely available 
to investors across society.
For us Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
is about creating shared value. To better help 
manage our impact and our need to create shared 
value, we have divided our ESG focus across nine 
main focus areas. We have also connected these 9 
ESG focus areas with three corresponding United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that 
we believe are particularly relevant for Flow Traders.
Below we outline our priorities within each of these 
ESG focus areas, and explain our extended efforts to 
positively impact the world around us. At the end of 
this chapter we provide more information on our 
SDGs.
Flow Traders ESG mission and ambition
The world is facing significant challenges in ensuring 
a sustainable future for our people and our planet. 
Many national and international initiatives are 
addressing these challenges. Every organization will 
have to play its own role in the transition to a 
sustainable society, depending on its impact and its 
opportunities.
The finance sector can be an important contributor 
to the global sustainability agenda and can promote 
sustainable finance, by incorporating environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) factors into investment 
decision-making, and by supporting the allocation of 
capital to sustainable initiatives.
Flow Traders has a critical and important role to play 
in the global financial ecosystem and ensures that 
financial markets function in an orderly manner. We 
serve the real economy by allowing investors, 
including pension funds and retail investors, to 
manage their risks by being able to trade at all 
times. Moreover, market makers such as ourselves, 
have made it much cheaper and more efficient to 
trade than in previous decades, which benefits 
everyone. In this key role Flow Traders has a 
responsibility to contribute to the financial stability 
and the sustainable agenda in the countries in which 
we operates (see Flow Traders’ value creation 
model). As a key market participant, at the core of 
the financial ecosystem, Flow Traders will support 
the acceleration of the transition towards sustainable 
growth and finance, notably by providing liquidity in 
the ever growing suite of ESG ETFs.
Flow Traders ESG ambition is to ensure to smooth 
functioning of markets which will assist in financing 
the transition towards a sustainable society by:
▪
Investing in our trading capabilities to ensure 
that sustainable investment products can be 
traded easily and efficiently;
▪
Promoting the drive for fair and transparent 
markets, in continuous collaboration with the 
financial and investment community;
▪
Operating with high ethical standards at all times 
and compliance with laws and regulations and 
respecting human rights;
▪
Promoting sustainable tangible practices within 
our company and towards our communities, by 
respecting and developing our people and by 
supporting our ecosystem.

EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system, which 
will be used to determine, and report on, which 
activities are sustainable, through the creation of 
activity specific sustainability criteria. As financial 
and non-financial actors must report on their 
performance in reference to the same criteria, the 
Taxonomy will create a common language for 
companies, investors and society alike. Corporate 
activities (known as economic activities under the 
Taxonomy regulation), will need to be aligned with 
the following three elements to be considered 
sustainable or “green” under the Taxonomy 
Regulation: a) Substantially contribute to at least 
one of the six environmental objectives per the 
Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) defined in the 
Regulation; b) Do no significant harm to any of the 
remaining five environmental objectives; and c) 
Comply with the minimum social safeguards. The 
European Commission (EC) is defining TSC for the 
six environmental objectives at a sector and 
economic activity level. The TSC for Climate Change 
Adaptation (CCA) and Climate Change Mitigation 
(CCM) have already been defined in the EU 
Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act.
The EU Taxonomy Regulation was adopted by the 
European Parliament in June 2020 and is now 
binding throughout the EU. The EU Taxonomy 
currently applies to Flow Traders as Flow Traders 
falls under the scope of the Non Financial Reporting 
Directive (NFRD) and as an Investment Firm under 
IFR/IFD.
As part of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the Group 
has prepared the mandatory overview of Total 
Assets broken down into EU Taxonomy KPI relevant 
asset classes.
Accordingly, we report a nil value for the Eligibility 
EU Taxonomy percentage for 2022. As a global 
liquidity provider, we have no direct access to the 
entities for which we hold ETP, equity, debt or other 
instruments on our balance sheet as at 31 December 
2022. Moreover, 2022 annual accounts including 
Taxonomy information are not available. We have 
not provided disclosure regarding voluntary EU 
Eligible Taxonomy percentages as our balance sheet 
reflects a point-in-time position and our trading 
books reflect the extremely short holding periods in 
relation to the underlying assets.  In our view, a 
voluntary eligible EU Taxonomy percentage will not 
provide readers of this report any insight to our 
contribution to Climate Change Mitigation and/or 
Climate Change Adaption.
Stakeholder expectations and 
materiality analysis
As a first step towards the creation of our ESG 
strategy, we performed in late 2020, a materiality 
analysis to identify the ESG related issues that 
should be our main areas of focus. Based on internal 
and external developments we determined a 
shortlist of relevant topics. To determine the priority 
of the relevant topics we first launched a stakeholder 
consultation process to identify the ESG related 
issues that various stakeholders believe should be 
our main areas of focus, through a survey. Flow 
Traders has had the feedback from a wide selection 
of stakeholders, including shareholders, 
counterparties and issuers and employees. These 
stakeholders were selected because Flow Traders 
directly influences their interests. These Flow 
Traders’ stakeholders recognize that we play a role 
in ESG from numerous standpoints: Flow Traders as 
a participant in the financial markets ecosystem, 
Flow Traders as a business providing services and as 
a corporate actor. In each of these roles, Flow 
Traders has different responsibilities. A consultation 
was held with internal management to prioritize the 
issues with which Flow Traders can have the most 
economic, environmental and societal impact. The 
outcomes of the stakeholder and management 
prioritization is presented in the materiality matrix 
below which was validated by both the Management 
Board and Supervisory Board, helped us determine 
our ESG priorities. The x-axis represents the 
prioritization by internal management and the y-axis 
the prioritization by stakeholders. On the basis of 
the materiality matrix Flow Traders has identified 9 
key issues, of which five are considered highly 
material.

Activities relating to ESG priorities
1. Business integrity
At Flow Traders, business integrity means 
conducting business within a framework of laws and 
regulations, to high ethical standards, and in 
accordance with our own policies and procedures. 
We also have a great respect for human rights in 
every jurisdiction where we operate. Moreover, Flow 
Traders operates in an industry where the risk of 
modern slavery and human trafficking is inherently 
low and in jurisdictions where labour standards are 
high.
Nonetheless, we have applied to become a signatory 
to the United Nations Global Compact. Flow Traders’ 
complies with these fundamental rights, conventions 
and recommendations, notably social rights, 
freedom of association and equality, abolishment of 
forced and child labour. An example of our business 
integrity can be seen in the fact we have zero 
tolerance towards bribery and corruption and we 
actively ensure that no such behaviour occurs. No 
cases of bribery or corruption were reported in 2022. 
Continuous training of staff as well as robust risk 
and compliance controls contribute to the business 
integrity of Flow Traders.
2. Liquidity in financial markets
As a liquidity provider we are active on global 
financial markets and we contribute to transparency 
in the pricing process, enabling market participants 
to invest at fair prices and lower costs. We enable 
thousands of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and 
other financial products to be traded across the 
world’s markets, by continuously quoting bid and 
ask prices. As an innovative segment of global 
financial markets, ETPs have introduced efficiencies 
and cut investment costs substantially for a wide 
range of investors, from pension funds to retail 
investors. Increased liquidity, higher execution 
quality, and lower overall trading costs are just 
some of the benefits that liquidity providers, such as 
Flow Traders, offer through these innovative 
financial products compared to more traditional 
investment products. We are seeking to bring the 
same benefits to other markets we operate in such 
as fixed income (corporate bonds) and digital assets. 
In 2022 we saw an increase in the amount of ESG 
ETFs and ETPs, including ESG products focused on 
clean/alternative energy investments. As a leading 
liquidity provider in ETPs globally, Flow Traders 
naturally trades ESG-related products with its 
counterparties. 
Our role is to enable trading in widely diversified 
investment products to anyone at any time, allowing 
end-investors to invest with lower costs and thus 
produce potentially higher returns. As a result of the 
efforts of liquidity providers such as ourselves, over 
the years trading costs have dropped dramatically 
and access to transparent and inexpensive 
investment products for anyone has never been 
more open or efficient. This benefits institutional 
investors, individual investors and, ultimately, 
society at large by creating a more open and 
accessible financial market.
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   34

## Page 35

This role was never more important than during the 
exceptional and extraordinary market circumstances 
evident in late March and early April 2020 when Flow 
Traders was able to continuously provide liquidity 
and pricing to the ETP markets on a global basis. 
End-investors, issuers and counterparties have been 
reassured by our continuous presence when markets 
were under pressure which has enabled them to 
trade in all circumstances and when liquidity is most 
sought after.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager 
and do not have our own Assets under Management 
(AuM). We also do not develop or make products, do 
not provide any services and do not have 
(consumer) clients. Our value chain comprises, 
among others, of our institutional counterparties, 
prime brokers and regulators.
3. 
Good corporate governance
As of 13 January 2023, Flow Traders operates a one-
tier board governance structure, comprising 
executive and non-executive directors. The 
executive directors along with the Executive 
Committee which was established in September 
2022 are responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the company, formulating strategies 
and policies, and setting and achieving our 
objectives. The non-executive directors on the Board 
supervises and advises the senior management 
team. The Board is accountable to the Annual 
General Meeting for the company's and its 
performance.
Our governance is reflected in our internal rules and 
regulations, including our Articles of Association, By-
Laws, the Terms of Reference of our Board 
committees and our Code of Conduct. These, 
together with our policies, can be found on our 
website. 
Flow Traders remains focused on long-term value 
creation, culture and risk management while 
balancing the interests of our many stakeholders, 
such as shareholders, senior management 
executives, counterparties, suppliers, investors, 
employees, regulators and the community. When 
making decisions, both boards carefully weighs the 
interest of all these stakeholders in relation to our 
company objectives and ESG priorities. ESG strategy 
and agenda is determined and set by the Executive 
Directors and Executive Committee with regular 
monitoring by the Board. Please refer to the chapter 
‘Governance’ for further information.
4. 
Diversity and inclusion
Flow Traders is a multinational company with offices 
across the globe. This naturally creates an 
environment where people of diverse cultures and 
backgrounds collaborate and drive our organization 
forward, excel every day, and perform at the highest 
level possible. We believe that a diverse workforce, 
which has open communication channels and the 
freedom to collaborate and introduce best practices, 
helps create a richer variety of ideas and can better 
develop solutions to the challenges we face. 
We have a long-standing policy of recruiting and 
retaining the best talent available and aim to provide 
an inclusive working environment regardless of the 
gender, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation of our 
employees. We are committed to providing equal 
employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants.
Companies that are diverse in e.g., age, gender, 
race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, 
ethnicity, and perspective are proven to be more 
successful in attracting talent and are also proven to 
accomplish better performance and growth. A 
diverse workforce will stimulate greater innovation 
and creativity, bring forward a larger range of skills, 
increase productivity through a broad range of 
background and experience, and provide more talent 
to choose from.
Flow Traders embraces this philosophy and sees the 
added value diversity brings to our business. Our 
current company demographics are also something 
to be proud of:
▪
Over 25% of the world’s nationalities (of all 
inhabited continents) are represented in our 
650+employee workforce over 8 offices globally
▪
Our people bring in experience over 50 academic 
study backgrounds, providing multiple angles, 
broad perspectives, and insights to solve 
challenges together and develop personally by 
learning from others
▪
We are a relatively young company with an 
overall average age of 34 years. However, we 
see a healthy mix of ages through all ranks with 
~40% of our workforce in the age category of 
30-40 years old. Average age between our three 
company divisions (Trading, Tech, and Business 
Support) is also balanced with a difference in 
average age of less than 5 years
▪
Gender diversity is on our mind at Flow Traders. 
Our Business Support division, comprising of 
~180 employees, shows a balanced ratio of 51% 
female employees in line with the sector 
benchmark of 44%. The Tech and Trading 
divisions female representation is growing
▪
We employ people from 58 nationalities across 
our offices. 
We strongly encourage women to apply for any 
function within the firm, particularly when they have 
a background in fields that traditionally have a 
higher proportion of male employees. This is 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   35

supported by our new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
policy which was adopted and approved by the 
Supervisory Board on 21 September 2022. 
We are committed to being a truly equal opportunity 
employer, by recruiting, retaining and promoting 
people based on merit, and merit alone. This also 
holds for our Board and accordingly, Flow Traders 
met the Dutch legislative requirement that at least 
one-third of its Supervisory Board consists of women 
and one-third consists of men in 2022. For any 
further future board appointments, due regard will of 
course be made towards our Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion policy (September 2022).
To ensure we keep evolving, enforcing, and 
nurturing our company culture we want to increase 
our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion mark. For the 
coming years we have indicated several targets 
across the three themes. Some of these targets are 
mandatory and need to be made public (in e.g. the 
Annual Report) or reported to external organizations 
(e.g. the SER; “Sociaal Economische Raad”). Other 
targets are voluntary targets that we feel strongly 
about.
Below is Flow Traders’ DE&I strategy for the coming 
years up to 2025. Mandatory KPIs/targets have been 
marked to clarify the difference between chosen 
metrics/targets and metrics/targets that are non-
negotiable.
Diversity
In general, we aim to incorporate diversity aspects 
such as nationality, age, gender, educational 
background or professional background into decision 
making concerning the composition of our 
workforce. To the extent possible, this also applies 
to the composition of our Management Board, 
Supervisory Board and Executive Committee, as well 
as the corporate bodies of Flow Traders B.V.
Regardless of rules and regulations, we see diversity 
as a means to guarantee a safe and inclusive 
environment for our employees. Nonetheless, since 
the introduction of “de wet ingroeiquotum en 
streefcijfers” as per 1 January 2022 it has become 
increasingly important to track explicit metrics and 
have clear targets to work towards. This piece of 
legislation obliges corporates to disclose a number of 
diversity metrics. We therefore aim for the following 
goals and targets:
▪
Strive to have more than 20% of world’s 
nationalities working at Flow Traders (currently 
25%)
▪
Strive to have women in Technology at par with 
the market (benchmark 17%)
▪
Strive to have at least 1/3 female and 1/3 male 
non-executive directors
▪
Strive to have at least one female and one male 
executive director
▪
Flow Traders top-50 (which includes the 
members of the Executive Committee) reflects 
the total workforce gender distribution
Equity and Inclusion
Equity and Inclusion are paramount in maintaining 
and thriving our entrepreneurial culture and 
mindset. Next to current focus we are always 
looking to expand and improve. In the coming years 
we will therefore keep on evolving and implementing 
initiatives to keep Equity and inclusion top of mind. 
Below a subset of what’s on the roadmap
▪
Increase our range of (online) training even 
further on communication and unconscious bias
▪
Include a D&I module in our Leadership training 
to train our managers on inclusive leadership
▪
Start with “high performing team training” and 
offer team activities around DE&I to ensure more 
inclusive collaboration and train employees in 
understanding how inclusion will improve 
performance / high performing teams
▪
Become even more vocal internally and 
externally about our (D)E&I initiatives, partnering 
with other companies in the sector on big DE&I 
topics
▪
Create even more external awareness about Flow 
Traders, our mission, our people, and our culture 
through external events.
▪
Keep reviewing policies and procedures on a 
yearly basis and update/create were applicable or 
required by law
We also believe in open communication and 
encourage collaboration across the company. 
Everyone within the company has unrestricted, 
direct access to senior management and are 
regularly informed and consulted about key 
developments. People are encouraged to speak their 
minds to help make Flow Traders a better place to 
work. Information travels freely and is not restricted 
unless we need to protect overriding interests, such 
as those concerning regulations, commercial 
sensitivities or to protect our intellectual property.
5. 
Sustainable employment
Since the day we were founded, our goal has been 
to foster a culture that encourages innovation, 
entrepreneurialism and risk-awareness, while 
focusing on drive, teamwork and ownership. By 
developing talent in-house and maintaining a 
committed and substantial employee shareholder 
base, we have strengthened internal bonds and 
helped create a loyal, forward-looking team. We are

proud that we create and maintain high-quality jobs, 
which result in a stable and trusting working 
environment that benefits our people, our business, 
and society. This is reflected in a low absenteeism 
rate of 1.36% globally in 2022 (2021: 1.51%).
Our offices are all growing, and we look to hire as 
many qualified applicants as we can find. However, 
our selection standards remain high – our 
candidates need to go through a number of tests 
and interviews, with less than 1 percent of 
applicants for trading positions ultimately receiving a 
job offer. To find people with the unique skill sets 
needed for a global liquidity provider we recruit 
across the globe, advertising and searching across 
multiple platforms. We also visit campuses in India, 
Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, the US, and across 
Europe, meeting talents in career fairs and 
workshops. This year, due to the easing of 
pandemic-related restrictions, we have resumed in 
person campus recruiting events. We still recruit for 
all disciplines and look for the best calibre available, 
regardless of their gender, age, ethnicity, faith or 
sexual orientation. To take an unbiased decision, in 
our recruitment process for certain events, certain 
data, including names and gender, is blacked out.
Graduate traders are typically recruited straight 
from university. Although our traders have a varied 
educational background, they share a strong 
numerical aptitude, which is why a numerical test is 
an important part of the selection procedure. To 
experience the world of trading first hand, we invite 
a select group of students to our Business Courses in 
our Amsterdam and New York offices. The two-day 
event is packed with interesting and challenging 
trading exercises and simulations and includes 
quantitative and technical cases to mirror the 
evolving nature of the role. In a similar fashion, we 
host the Flow Traders Arbitrage Challenge case 
competition in Singapore and Hong Kong. We also 
host numerous informal events such as the annual 
poker tournaments in Amsterdam, Australia and 
New York, chess tournaments in Amsterdam, and 
trading competitions in select universities in Canada, 
the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore.
As a technology enabled firm, we facilitate 
opportunities for young talent in technology. In 2022 
we continued to invest in the Graduate Software 
Development program, which will enhance the 
experience of new graduates joining the company in 
2022. The program was designed for ambitious, 
skilled and creative graduates who like to be 
challenged every day and who strive to make visible 
contributions to the further growth of our business. 
Successful applicants join the company’s 
development teams for one year to work on a 
variety of projects. One of the goals is to improve 
the proprietary technology platform that enables 
Flow Traders to trade on exchanges worldwide. The 
projects cover multiple areas of our technology 
landscape. After completing their project, 
participants present their results to a jury, led by 
senior members of the Technology department. 
Throughout the program, graduates receive 
continuous support from dedicated mentors, not 
only in the field of technology, but also in the area of 
personal development.
Graduate Software Developers are typically recruited 
straight from university, having Computer Science or 
Engineering-related educational backgrounds. All 
graduates share a strong interest in either C++ or 
Java, which is why a coding test is an important part 
of the selection procedure. To experience 
development at Flow Traders first hand, we invite an 
exclusive group of students to our technology event 
CODE@FLOW in our Amsterdam office. The two-day 
challenge gives participants an opportunity to 
engage in high-tech discussions and technical cases 
with our specialists in software development and 
trading, followed by a competitive hackathon.
In 2022 we continued hosting, participating in, and 
sponsoring a variety of events, ranging from in-
house days to a special event for women who are 
curious about a career in the trading industry to 
various meet ups. With the opening of our London 
office in 2018, we have structurally increased our 
presence at the relevant universities in the UK and 
held multiple recruitment campaigns. 
All our offices are designed to provide a pleasant 
and ergonomically sound place to work. They are 
flooded with light, have attractive, well laid out 
interiors and ergonomically-optimized furniture. In 
addition, to give our people the opportunity to 
perform at their best, we offer healthy breakfast and 
lunch options, have our own bar in Amsterdam, 
Hong Kong, New York and Singapore, and organize 
great company trips and parties. In Amsterdam, we 
also have our own in-house gym facilities and an in-
house barber in New York. We not only use our 
newly-designed bars for after work gatherings, but 
also for recruiting events and quarterly staff 
updates. We believe these benefits are important to 
maintain a healthy and happy workforce and to 
stimulate bonding and connections beyond 
employees’ direct circle of colleagues, helping to 
encourage teamwork across the whole company. 
Following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions across 
the countries we operate in, we have formally 
instituted a hybrid working policy whereby certain 
function have the option of working from home for 2 
days a week. To facilitate this we have continued to 
invest in people’s home office environments by 
granting a budget for buying equipment.

We are a fast growing company, which creates good 
jobs across a variety of departments. In 2022 we 
welcomed 206 new hires (2021: 165), resulting in a 
8% percent increase in the number of FTEs year-on-
year. Our new colleagues join us from all parts of 
the world. To make sure they feel at home quickly 
we offer full relocation support for everyone moving 
to our offices from abroad.
We help with finding a home, applying for a visa and 
getting to know the local culture. We also offer our 
international employees based in Amsterdam the 
opportunity to attend Dutch language classes. In 
2022, 62 employees took advantage of this offer and 
attended a Dutch language class. At the start of this 
year, we once again had to onboard a large part of 
our new hires online, as we were limiting presence 
in the offices by having the majority of our staff 
working from home for a prolonged period of time 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We invest in our people. For example, we provide 
them with a range of excellent training programs, 
benefiting them and the company. 
Our new hires in trading and technology start with 
an intensive introduction program, bringing them up 
to speed with our way of working and training them 
in the specific skills they need to do their job well. 
All junior traders – including those hired for our 
Asian and the US offices – begin their global training 
program at our offices in Amsterdam. 
And all new employees receive an introduction to 
Flow Traders through the Flow Academy, including 
online and on-site training that provides programs in 
a wide variety of subjects, including culture, 
technology, regulatory developments, trading for 
non-traders, and the Whistleblower Policy, including 
anti-corruption. Through Flow Academy we offer 
everyone varied training opportunities, aimed at 
improving function-specific skills or for their own 
personal development. In 2022, we expanded soft 
skill training opportunities and created mid-level and 
advanced-level trading classes for our non-trading 
staff. In addition we created a second technology 
onboarding to provide a deep dive into our 
technology landscape.
In total, employees undertook 10,733 training hours 
during the course of 2022 which comprised of 
onboarding, leadership training, mandatory training, 
e-learnings and coaching programs.
Many of our managers are ‘home-grown’, having 
developed into their positions after a number of 
years working with the company. They set an 
example and act as an inspiration for new hires, 
illustrating the career paths open to them. And to 
complement self-growth, we also like to give our 
employees the chance to transfer between our 
offices and experience life and work elsewhere.

We believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and office 
are entitled to receive variable compensation 
relative to their contribution to the firm as a whole. 
We are transparent about how we pay our people 
and how much we pay them, including management. 
We have a Remuneration Policy that permits variable 
pay only when a profit is made. We are constantly 
looking for ways to improve our remuneration 
principles. And because variable remuneration is, to 
a large extent, deferred, it remains at risk of 
forfeiture if we sustain a loss. We believe this is the 
strongest incentive for sustainable, risk-aware 
behaviour for all our staff. In addition, we promote 
employee shareholding through rewarding a 
significant part of variable remuneration in shares. 
This aligns the interests of the company and its 
shareholders with those of our employees by 
creating ‘skin in the game’. 
Shares held by employees and Board 
members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, thus 
aligning the company’s long-term success to their 
personal financial circumstances. Since IPO, we have 
utilized a number of share schemes. Around the time 
of the IPO, our CEO at the time and a significant 
number of current and former employees invested in 
Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow Traders Cash 
Incentive Plan (FCIP) and Flow Traders Loyalty 
Incentive Plan (FLIP) were introduced. The FCIP was 
replaced in 2020 by a new share plan which provides 
the award up to 50% of variable remuneration in 
shares (or share-like instruments).
On 31 December 2022, 457 employees out of 660 
(31 December 2021, 407 out of 613) employees are 
active participants of various employee share plans.

6. 
Fair taxation
We are committed to being good corporate citizens, 
bringing positive value to the communities we 
operate in. We pay taxes where they are due and 
subscribe to fair taxation in terms of corporate 
income tax. We note that taxes are not limited to 
corporate income tax but also include VAT, wages 
tax, social securities, dividend withholding tax, 
stamp duties and other transaction taxes. In 2022 
we incurred total corporate income taxes of €35 
million (2021: €30 million) which was 22% (2021: 
21%)  of our taxable income. We believe it is vital to 
operate a fair, transparent and straightforward tax 
policy, which is required when running a sustainable 
business and delivering long-term value to all our 
stakeholders.
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect 
of its financial reporting and its relations with tax 
authorities globally. With regard to financial 
reporting, conservative accounting principles are 
being applied and one-offs must occur infrequently 
and be clearly documented. In the current rapid 
changing tax landscape and the associated various 
(new) tax reporting requirements, Flow Traders as a 
technology enabled liquidity provider strives to 
automate tax filing processes as much as possible. 
Flow Traders is a strong believer that by automating 
tax processes it improves the compliance quality and 
the insight of the company’s tax position.
The dialogue we have with stakeholders includes 
discussions on our financial reporting and tax policy 
and, as with all stakeholder input, is considered 
during our decision-making process. However, so far 
we have not seen a desire among stakeholders for a 
change to our tax policy. We support transparency 
initiatives, such as country-by-country reporting and 
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting from the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), and frequently assess the 
impact of such initiatives. We also closely monitor 
the reporting thresholds under the country-by-
country reporting rules, to ensure that we meet our 
reporting obligations when we fall under the scope of 
this rule. Where necessary or relevant, we take the 
appropriate actions to adopt these initiatives in our 
tax control framework. Further details on our tax 
policy can be found under Tax Principles on our 
website. The tax principles also serve as KPIs 
throughout our performance measurement. The tax

function within the company will therefore provide 
appropriate input as part of the approval process for 
business proposals to ensure a clear understanding 
of the tax consequences. 
We have good standing relationships with the tax 
authorities in each region in which we operate. We 
proactively manage our relationship with the tax 
authorities with the aim of minimizing the risk of 
challenge, dispute or damage that could have an 
impact on our credibility. We concluded a horizontal 
supervision agreement with the Dutch Tax Authority 
(horizontaal toezicht) with a view to further 
strengthening our transparent and professional 
relationship with the tax authorities. Tax laws, rules 
and interpretations are continuously subject to a 
changing social view towards tax and we cannot be 
certain of continued benefit from certain tax 
regimes, such as the innovation box regime in the 
Netherlands. Given the complexity of the 
continuously changing tax legislation, and the fact 
that this may create uncertainty for Flow Traders, 
we obtain independent external tax advice through 
reputable tax firms or, when appropriate, approval is 
obtained from tax authorities on specific material or 
complex tax matters.
The key participants in the Tax Control Framework 
are well established and include the Supervisory 
Board, Management Board, Finance department, Tax 
department and external auditors. They are able to 
assess and weigh the risks associated with the tax 
decision process for our business and stakeholders. 
Under Flow Traders Tax Control Framework, 
significant tax positions, including the tax strategy, 
are always shared with and subject to the approval 
of the Management Board. 
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local tax legislation. We do not use 
tax haven jurisdictions for tax avoidance purposes 
and carry out our business through entities in 
jurisdictions where we factually operate our 
business. With this simple tax philosophy in place, 
the company can operate its business in line with its 
belief that it is part of the corporate social 
responsibility duty to pay taxes where it operates. In 
addition to corporate income taxes, Flow Traders 
pays many other taxes, including but not limited to, 
payroll taxes and social security contributions on the 
wages of its employees, value added taxes and 
property taxes. All these taxes are a significant basis 
of funding governmental public services. It is our 
social responsibility to contribute through taxes in 
the regions we operate in.  For more information on 
our tax position, please refer to note 14 of the 
financial statements
Note:Total taxes due shows the total amount of tax due as a result of the 
financial performance of the Group in the respective year.

Societal commitments and 
charities
At Flow Traders, we believe it is important to 
support initiatives that contribute to society in a 
positive way. We’ve done so for many years – 
through the firm and via our colleagues’ personal 
efforts. We support several charities, not only 
financially but also by offering our knowledge, 
expertise and time.  Our people have always been 
enthusiastic about supporting charitable initiatives, 
something which is also a core part of our company 
culture. 
To continue giving to our communities in a more 
structured manner, we established the Flow Traders 
Foundation (‘the Foundation’) in 2020. Over the past 
few years, we have continued to support several 
global and local charities and projects. Each year we 
have also focused on an annual theme, past themes 
have been: COVID-19, Education and the theme for 
2022 was helping the people of Ukraine. 
The Board of the Foundation (Sjoerd Rietberg, 
former Co-CEO of Flow Traders) retained his role as 
Chairman, as did Jan van Kuijk (Treasurer) and 
Roger Hodenius (Secretary) with respect to their 
roles.
Flow Traders N.V. donated 175.000 Flow Traders 
shares to the Foundation in 2020. The two Flow 
Traders founders as well as members of the 
Management Board, employees and former 
employees have committed to provide further 
funding, adding up to a total contribution of €3.25 
million which will be received over a period of five 
years and which will be partially used to acquire 
Flow Traders shares to ensure long-term cash flows 
for the Foundation. By the end of the year 2022 the 
Foundation owned 266,220 shares in the company. 
These shares yielded almost €280,000 over the 
year, all in the form of dividends for the benefit of 
the Foundation. In addition, the Foundation has 
received €435,000 in cash from Flow Traders Ltd. in 
2022 as part of a yearly variable contribution.
This funding allowed the Foundation to commence 
fulfilling its mission of fighting poverty through 
supporting charities. At the Foundation, there is a 
focus on tackling challenges faced by those in 
poverty, through supporting highly transparent and 
cost-effective causes that contribute to improving 
people’s lives. The strategy of the Foundation is 
based on and embraces the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goal 1 - No Poverty. Since 
the focus in 2022 has been on helping the Ukraine, 
donations were made to several projects which 
support people in Ukraine and the surrounding 
countries that were impacted by the war and 
projects which focused on helping displaced 
Ukrainian people who came to the Netherlands. 
The contributions the Foundation makes to different 
charities and projects are divided into three different 
categories:
1. Ad-hoc contributions
2. One–year contributions, based on the annual 
theme (i.e. Ukraine in 2022)
3. Long-term contributions of at least three years to 
structurally support a cause 
Based on these categories and the annual theme of 
2022 we supported various charities and projects 
across the globe. Next to this we continued our 
support for our long-term projects from 2020 and 
2021 such as Free a Girl, Flor Ayuda, Project 
Backboard, Neighbor Share and Stichting Petje Af.
The charities we supported based on the annual 
theme were: UNHCR, Netherlands for Ukraine 
Foundation (NL4UA), War Child (project Team Up), 
the Red Cross and several great initiatives 
nominated by our employees. 
8. 
Stakeholder engagement
Flow Traders operates in one of the most regulated 
and competitive markets and is part of an innovative 
industry. In the era in which we find ourselves 
today, business, politics and society merge almost 
seamlessly together. New opportunities, challenges 
and regulatory change are always on the horizon as 
the industry continues to innovate and paradigms 
shift. We connect with several stakeholders and 
peers to collaboratively demonstrate the benefit for 
society originating from our innovative industry and 
other tech-oriented companies. In addition, to be 
able to take our corporate responsibility agenda to 
the next level, we engage with our stakeholders on a 
continuous basis to understand whether we have a 
mutual vision on business developments and 
essential reforms in our regulatory environment. We 
consistently monitor and analyse societal and 
regulatory trends and carry out materiality 
assessments to categorize topics that may affect our 
business operations and that could inform our 
strategy, targets and reporting. 
Commitment
We commit to continuously providing liquidity to 
secure global financial markets which are essential 
for real economic growth and create value for all 
people. We always enter the public debate with full 
transparency, substantiate our long-term vision with 
data-driven arguments and identify viable 
improvements for the financial markets. Our 
contributions to the regulatory and legislative 
dialogue are typically made public and we are 
always willing to discuss our position and the 
interests we take into account.

One of the main issues we addressed in our long-
term engagement with regulators marked the capital 
requirement regime for investment firms. Besides 
the onerous changes in capital requirements and 
thresholds, the IFR/IFD implementation also 
impacted other internal policies and our group 
governance in 2022, which were discussed with the 
national competent authorities. These encounters 
and pending issues demonstrate that the review 
process of IFR/IFD starting in 2023, will be 
detrimental in creating a viable and competitive 
European regulatory framework that supports 
innovation and enables imminent developments 
regarding digital assets and decentralized finance. 
Aligned with this issue we campaigned along with 
industry peers an alternative proposal on capital 
requirements related to digital assets.
Furthermore, 2022 was characterized by intensifying 
proactive work to position Flow Traders in the 
discussions regarding the MiFIR Review, the new EU 
Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules and Dutch 
corporate and financial markets legislation. The 
MiFIR review includes some important topics for 
proprietary trading firms like the consolidated tape 
and a review of payment for order flow (PFOF). We 
have reconfirmed our position to robust market 
transparency and strive for a near real time 
consolidate tape, specifically  in the bond market 
without deferrals longer then printing the data of 
large volume trades at the end of the trading day. 
Because the political agreement on MiCA marks the 
beginning of regulating the digital asset ecosystem, 
Flow Traders will maintain its involvement  in the 
next phase of the legislative process and the 
following implementation. 
Collaboration
As part of our regulatory strategy and agenda, we 
collaborate with other market participants, 
governments, regulators, interest groups and trade 
associations to align on key issues impacting the 
industry we operate in. Flow Traders also through all 
its activities continuously strives for fair, transparent 
and efficient financial markets. One of the key pillars 
of this strategy is to establish open dialogue with our 
stakeholders, responding to their views and 
concerns to be able to balance competing 
expectations. We are always keen to address 
pressing issues, demonstrates our positive impact to 
society and ultimately improve our business. As part 
of our collaborative strategy, we contribute to 
representative bodies like the EU Consolidated Tape 
Expert Group and the Foreign Exchange Contact 
Group at the ECB and advisory committees of 
exchanges. We are an active member of several 
trade associations and are participating specifically 
in the board of the Dutch Association of Proprietary 
Traders (APT) and the Executive Committee of the 
European Proprietary Traders Association (FIA-
EPTA). In our trade associations we have 
representation on several committees regarding 
market structure, prudential regulation, digital 
assets and DeFi, sustainable finance and ESG, 
diversity and well-being. Flow Traders is also a 
member of Holland Fintech, the International Capital 
Markets Association (ICMA) and participates in 
several other professional networks.
Our Board and management engage with 
shareholders, prospective investors and other 
stakeholders throughout the year and had 381 
engagement meetings in 2022 either one-on-one, in 
market intelligence meetings or at a (virtual) 
conference and high level seminars. Notably, the 
Supervisory Board also engaged with shareholders, 
proxy agencies and governance bodies regarding the 
remuneration policy for the Management Board, ESG 
and corporate governance developments and the 
update of our holding structure. In addition, our 
employees contribute to our engagement efforts, 
providing their knowledge and expertise to better 
inform our stakeholders, improve regulation and 
safeguard fair markets. Together, as a team, we 
serve society by improving financial markets, 
supporting innovation and inspiring people.

Carbon emissions, material use 
and waste
Flow Traders considers its overall direct impact on 
the environment to be low. Due to the nature of our 
business, Flow Traders has a relatively light carbon 
footprint in relation to its direct activities. We 
promote public transport by having conveniently 
located offices and by not offering lease cars as well 
as where possible using video-conferencing to limit 
travel. 
Nevertheless, conscious of the challenges linked to 
climate change, the need to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and to manage natural resources 
prudently and sparingly, Flow Traders has sought to 
integrate environmental issues into its activities and 
strategy. In this context, Flow Traders carried out an 
analysis for the first time of its carbon footprint in 
2020 which serves as the baseline. In 2021 and 
2022 we carried out the yearly carbon footprint 
analyses. In 2022 we applied improved 
measurement models as part of our approach for 
continuous improvement. The right data informs the 
decision making process. This was particularly 
relevant for the electricity consumption in our 
buildings using primary data (scope 2).  Flow 
Traders will focus in the coming years on reducing 
its carbon footprint. Since 2020, Flow Traders has 
been a Carbon-Neutral company for our own 
operations, committing to zero emissions by 
offsetting our entire carbon footprint. By measuring, 
mitigating and offsetting our remaining carbon 
footprint, we aim to do our part in tackling global 
climate change, while supporting sustainable 
development in local communities.

Flow Traders reports its scope 1 & 2 emissions via 
the operational control approach. Scope 2 
represents market-based emissions from electricity. 
For more information please refer to our Carbon 
footprint report, which can be requested from 
Investor Relations. Flow Traders’ carbon footprint is 
equivalent to 4741 tons CO2eq (2021: 1287 tons 
CO2eq) that may be split as following:
▪
scope 1 = 241 tons CO2eq representing 5% of 
Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint,  which are 
direct emissions from buildings;
▪
scope 2 = 2,956 tons CO2eq representing 62% 
of Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint, which 
comprise. electricity consumption from buildings;
▪
scope 3 = 1,545 tons CO2eq representing 33% 
of Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint, which 
currently calculated through business flights and 
the use of servers but exclude our strategic 
investments which have additional carbon 
footprints.
Flow Traders’ primary GHG emissions arise from 
energy use in its offices and data centers, from staff 
travel, and indirectly from its supply chain (Scope 
3). Flow Traders has a direct grasp only on Scope 1 
and 2, which represent only 67% of the complete 
GHG emissions. For scope 3, we will need to initiate 
a dialogue with our entire value chain (upstream and 
downstream) to act on the bulk of these emissions.
In addition, for several years, Flow Traders has 
taken care to reduce its consumption of paper and 
water in its offices and data centres as well as 
reduce its waste to minimize its ecological footprint. 
We have stopped using single-use water bottles and 
provided employees with reusable water bottles. 
This has limited the plastic waste within the 
company significantly. When refurbishing our offices, 
we sought to use more environmentally friendly 
solutions for lighting and water consumption. We 
also offer a full lunch to all our employees, healthy 
and free of charge. We work to limit our food waste 
as much as possible by responsible purchasing of 
ingredients and making sure leftovers are consumed 
the next day.
Our culture and values
We have always believed that creating a strong and 
successful business requires a set of shared values 
that everyone can rally around. Values that help 
shape how everyone behaves, feels and develops at 
work. We live by our values every day - they are at 
the core of what we do:
▪
We make investing cheaper, fairer and more 
efficient for end-investors
▪
We support markets with liquidity provision 
under all circumstances
▪
We promote fair, transparent and orderly 
markets
▪
We promote competition on a level playing field
▪
We comply with all rules and regulations
▪
We subscribe to fair taxation and transparent 
reporting
▪
We are open, informal and diverse
▪
We want colleagues to take ownership, be 
entrepreneurial and be team players
▪
We reward responsibility, performance and 
initiatives that benefit the firm as a whole
▪
We always give back to society and the 
communities we live in
These values are a reflection of the things we 
believe in. And they shape our culture. We believe 
that how you perform is more important than what 
you wear. So our employees dress comfortably for 
work – jeans, t-shirts and sneakers are common. We 
believe that what someone says is more important 
than who says it. We believe that the contributions 
of our team-members are crucial to the success of 
the company. We believe that two people know 
more than one, and that people can have great 
ideas even in areas different to their core expertise. 
Which is why we welcome and encourage everyone 
to share their opinions. Anyone with a good idea, in 
their own area of expertise or another, is 
encouraged to share. This is part of the open,

informal and diverse culture that makes us who we 
truly are.
Nurturing our inclusive and equal 
culture
Maintaining, preserving and nurturing our culture is 
extremely important to everyone across the 
organization. This is done by:
▪
The Management Board - through the 
organization of firm-wide events and company 
outings as well as regular all-staff updates. In 
addition, a bi yearly engagement survey is 
offered to ensure open communication and 
enable employees to raise their voice
▪
Business departments - providing specific 
trainings or learning sessions towards our people 
through which we actively stimulate their 
personal and career development.
▪
Colleagues themselves - reinforcing the strength 
of our culture by organizing their own events, 
competitions, and charitable endeavours.
▪
Societal commitments and charities - Supporting 
multiple charities, also through our own Flow 
Traders Foundation, not only financially but also 
by offering access to our knowledge and 
experience.
To guarantee the safe and inclusive environment 
Flow Traders lays emphasis on several strong 
enablers to make all employees feel included and 
safe.
▪
A group of internal and external ‘trusted persons’ 
to discuss challenges and difficulties in private in 
case desirable.
▪
A proven zero-tolerance policy in case of 
unacceptable behaviour in any form whatsoever 
and clear follow up procedures towards all 
stakeholders.
▪
Ability to always work in the office to connect and 
thrive together.
▪
Ability to work from home at dedicated moments 
per week to maintain the flexibility to perform in 
the best way possible if that means working from 
a remote location.
▪
A non-hierarchical working culture in which all 
employees can easily contact each other without 
any hierarchical boundaries (e.g., MB members 
and senior leadership always approachable, 
instilling ownership and accountability).
▪
A wide range of global and local company events 
in which all employees from all backgrounds can 
participate if they like to.
▪
A focus on healthy lifestyle for employees to 
participate in voluntarily (gym with personal 
programs, hairdresser, massages, healthy 
kitchen meals and nutrition advise, etc.).
Outstanding behaviour in 2022
There have been many individual examples of 
outstanding behaviour which has reinforced Flow 
Traders’ strong culture. Examples worth highlighting 
include:
▪
Various colleagues continue to give up their 
valuable spare time to assist with the ongoing 
operation of the Flow Traders Foundation.
▪
Annual Sinterklaas toy donations in Amsterdam
▪
Climbing Kilimanjaro to raise money for charity
▪
Support for Project Backboard and 
NeighborShare by colleagues in our New York 
office

Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations (UN) has identified 17 SDGs that 
are designed to help bring peace and prosperity for 
people and the planet as we work collectively 
towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development. In 2020 we performed a materiality 
analysis to identify our ESG priorities. Based on 
these ESG priorities we analyzed the SDGs on 
subtarget level, to identify the three SDGs we (can) 
have an impact on. In 2022 we will be developing 
our ESG strategy to steer towards more positive 
impact on these SDGs. 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   47

## Page 48

Outlook
Our aim is to continue to look for ways to strengthen 
our ESG focus and associated disclosure. With this in 
mind, we will seek to develop a full ESG and 
sustainability strategy. This will include alignment 
with relevant reporting standards as well as setting 
targets and associated KPIs. We will also develop 
and adopt specific policies, including human rights 
policy, environmental policy and supply chain policy. 
Given the EU Taxonomy is relatively new and 
contains some significant uncertainties around 
specific implementation, Flow Traders will continue 
to assess the eligibility and the extent of the 
Taxonomy alignment during the course of 2023. 
Accordingly, this may impact the way in which Flow 
Traders addresses EU Taxonomy reporting in 2023.
Going concern
Flow Traders, having made appropriate enquiries, 
consider that adequate resources exist for the Group 
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the 2022 financial statements. In reaching 
these conclusions, the Group’s financial position as 
at 31 December 2022 and the strong free cash flow 
of the Group, the Group’s ability to access capital 
markets and the principal risks facing the Group are 
taken into consideration. A commentary on the 
Group’s cash flows, financial position and liquidity 
for the year ended 31 December 2022 is set out in 
the section notes to the consolidated financial 
statements. The Group’s capital position is strong 
and therefore the Management Board believes that 
Flow Traders is well prepared for the future.

Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital 
base well above the required margins in order to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. 
The Executive Committee monitors the return on 
capital as well as the level of dividends to 
shareholders while complying with prime broker and 
regulatory capital requirements.
The available capital in the trading companies is 
monitored on a daily basis to ensure that 
requirements are met at all times and sufficient 
capital is available to support the Group’s strategy.
Capital requirements
The Group needs to comply with capital 
requirements from its prime brokers, as well as 
regulatory capital requirements. Capital is being 
managed by the Group in order to maintain net 
liquidity (which represents the value of our trading 
positions, principally long and short positions in 
equity securities, plus cash and cash equivalents) in 
excess of our various capital requirements at all 
times, while simultaneously exceed the regulatory 
capital requirements.
Prime broker capital requirements
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain 
certain minimum capital levels. Prime brokers use 
various internal systems to calculate required capital 
amounts (e.g., the ‘internal haircut model’ and the 
‘margin based approach model’, both intending to 
ensure sufficient levels of risk allowances) and have 
different limits structure, pre-funding possibilities 
and cut-off times for wiring capital. 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   48

## Page 49

The aggregate capital that the prime brokers require 
is significantly higher than their risk exposure. For 
example, we may clear two legs of one transaction 
through two different prime brokers. Even when the 
transaction is fully hedged (the risk is fully offset), 
each prime broker will still require capital for such 
position as if the risk is not being offset. The prime 
brokers cannot establish that the other prime broker 
has an offsetting position so they will charge a full 
capital requirement. This increases the capital they 
require us to maintain beyond what would be 
necessary. In addition, margin requirements of 
prime brokers are conservatively determined by the 
sophistication of their models and the regulatory 
requirements, which might not necessarily be 
efficient in respect of our business model and 
trading portfolios.
The following table sets out the capital required to 
be posted with our prime brokers and capital 
available (Net Liquidation value).

Regulatory capital requirements
In 2022, Flow Traders as a group and our subsidiary 
Flow Traders B.V. were subject to separate 
regulatory capital requirements in the Netherlands 
and our subsidiary Flow Traders U.S. LLC is subject 
to regulatory capital requirements in the United 
States. Flow Traders Asia Pte. Ltd. is exempt from 
regulatory capital requirements and Flow Traders 
Hong Kong Limited has a capital requirement in 
Hong Kong. Failure to comply with regulatory capital 
requirements could result in sanctions, including 
citations, fines, limits to our trading and revocation 
of a regulatory license. 
From 31 March 2018 until 25 June 2021, the 
company met the regulatory requirements of the EU 
Capital Requirement Regulation (CRR), which 
prescribes capital and reporting requirements. These 
regulatory capital requirements are supervised by 
the Dutch Central Bank in respect of Flow Traders 
B.V. and the company. As of 26 June 2021, the EU’s 
new Investment Firm Regulation and Directive (IFR/
IFD) has applied to Flow Traders and is implemented 
and supervised by the Dutch Central Bank.
Following the completion of the update of our 
corporate holding structure on 13 January 2023, 
group consolidated capital requirements are no 
longer applicable. Accordingly, CET1 and the Own 
Funds Requirement will no longer exist at the group 
level. Our regulated subsidiaries will continue to hold 
regulatory capital as required by their respective 
individual regulators.

Our Pillar III disclosures pursuant to IFR/IFD  can be 
requested through our website www.flowtraders.com 
around the time the Financial Statements of our 
Dutch trading entity, Flow Traders B.V., have been 
approved and published, which is expected to be 
within the next few months.
Management and control
Our global capital position is managed on a daily and 
intra-day level by the Risk and Mid-Office 
department. The Risk and Mid-Office department 
checks our positions and capital posted at every 
prime broker for correctness and compares these 
numbers with the relevant prime broker or 
regulatory requirements. Separately, the Finance 
department prepares a rolling 12-month forecast for 
our capital positions, every month. 
As part of our regulatory capital management cycle, 
the Risk and Mid-Office departments prepare a daily 
report that shows all the group’s positions and 
capital versus the regulatory capital requirements. 
At the end of every quarter the company and Flow 
Traders B.V. report their capital requirements and 
corresponding coverage to the Dutch Central Bank. 
A final part of the internal risk management and 
capital cycle is the annual Internal Capital and 
Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ICLAAP) for 
our largest trading entity, Flow Traders B.V.. The 
ICLAAP comprises a review of prevalent risks, the 
capital management processes, the risk 
management framework and an assessment of 
capital adequacy and liquidity and is reported to the 
Dutch Central Bank annually. The Dutch Central 
Bank assesses the capital adequacy for Flow Traders 
B.V. based on this report.

Our risk management
Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (ERMF) forms 
the foundation of our approach to 
managing risks. The ERMF is 
documented in Flow Traders’ Enterprise 
Risk Management Policy and is 
reviewed annually by our Management 
Board.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, 
quantify and document potential risks which are 
inherent to trading in an automated market-making 
firm. In the fast and dynamic environment of 
automated trading we designed our ERMF in such a 
way that it is robust, efficient and transparent. In 
the figure below, we present the stakeholders that 
have an interest and place value  in how our 
framework operates.
Our ERMF helps us to ensure that we have adequate 
systems and controls including the management of 
our liquidity and capital. This is delivered through a 
consistent, continuous and careful method for 
addressing, managing and prioritising our key risks 
in the context of our Group's strategic objectives.

Enterprise Risk Management
We aim for a good balance between our business 
activities, return on capital and related risks taken. 
Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
approach to ensure that our risk appetite and profile 
are integrated in our day-to-day operations and 
strategic decision-making. Every year, our 
Management Board derives its business targets after 
determining its strategic goals. Based on these 
targets and objectives, the Management Board 
formulates its risk appetite. The targets, objectives 
and risk appetite give direction to the various 
departments within the company and are used to 
derive our strategic risks. 
We deliver on the risk activities set out in our annual 
Risk Management cycle to ensure that the residual 
risk profile is (and remains) in line with our set risk 
appetite. In order to achieve this, we perform risk 
control self-assessments (RCSAs) to assess current 
risks and identify risks that have newly arisen. 
Following the RCSAs, the Management Board 
decides on the appropriate risk response.
Risk categories
Our risk taxonomy is split into three broad risk 
categories - Strategic, Operational and Financial risk 
- each with their own specific sub-risks:
Risk
Description
BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC
Strategic
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of Flow Traders’s business plan, from strategic 
changes in the business environment, and/or from adverse strategic business decisions.

of the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial instruments in which 
we trade.
Concentration
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of 
counterparties or products. Concentration risk also includes supplier dependency risks.
Project 
management
The risk of inaccurate project management leading to inadequate realization of project 
objectives.
COMPLIANCE AND ETHICAL

interests, fair market practices, and codes of conduct.
Financial crime
The risk of money laundering, sanctions violations, bribery and corruption, and Know

Regulatory 
compliance
Failure to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations that are not captured through 
other risks.
Reputation
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders.
FINANCIAL
Prudential
The risk the entity is not able to cover the cumulative net cash outflow or available 
capital (e.g. needed trading capital or regulatory capital) over a certain period.
Market
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market prices; in 
particular, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity 
prices.
Credit
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in trading in or 
issuing a financial instrument defaulting on an obligation. ESG risks are also having an 
increasing impact here.

Category Definition
Risk Appetite
Business and strategic risk
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of Flow 
Trader’s business plan, from strategic changes in 
the business environment, and/or from adverse 
strategic business decisions.
Flow Traders is prepared to take risk in a responsible way which: (i) takes our 
stakeholders’ interests into account and (ii) is consistent with our business 
objectives.
Compliance and ethics risk
Compliance risk would crystalise in Flow Traders’s 
potential exposure to legal fines, financial penalties 
and substantial loss, resulting from its failure to act 
according to industry laws and regulations, internal 
policies or industry best practices. Ethical risk refers 
to dealing with the negative consequences of acting 
unethically.
Considering the advance notice regulated firms get from their regulators about 
new regulations, Flow Traders has a low risk appetite for this risk as it directly 
impacts our reputation. It is mitigated by our Compliance department, who tracks 
new regulations, and supports adherence  on "Day 1" when they come into force. 
Furthermore, we hold ourselves responsible for acting with honesty, integrity and 
respect, that is a part our Code of Conduct; in addition to adhering to applicable 
laws and regulations in the jurisdictions that we operate.
Financial risk
Risk relating to positions in our Trading Book, 
including risks primarily related to Market Risk, 
Liquidity Risk and Credit Risk.
We manages our financial risk carefully by applying a strict set of criterion in our 
interactions with counterparties, issuers and other relevant financial institutions. 
In addition, we manage our financial positions through sound risk management 
principles as set out in our risk management policies.
Operational risk
The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people and systems or from 
external events. This definition includes legal risk, 
but excludes strategic and reputational risk.
Flow Traders is naturally exposed to operational risk, as a result of conducting its 
business operations. Any firm can not completely eliminate this risk as this would 
not allow a firm to achieve its business objectives. These risks have to be 
mitigated, accepted or deferred.
Technology risk
Risk to technology or data or applications that 
negatively impact Flow Traders’ operations.
About 40% of our employees work in our Technology Department. Technology is 
the backbone of Flow Traders and lies in one of its main competitive advantages. 
As a result, our risk appetite is moderate due to the complexity and intricacies of 
the trading venues we trade at. As part of our active risk mitigation, Flow Traders  
spend significant effort to maintain our residual  technology risk at a low level.

Risk Management Governance 
The effectiveness of risk management is linked to 
commitment and integrity. It is therefore crucial that 
the Management Board, the global and local 
department heads, and all employees are aware of 
the risks that the company faces and their  
responsibilities in managing it efficiently.
Our risk management is organised along three lines 
of defence.
The first line of defence is comprised of Trading, 
Technology and Operations. These departments are 
critical for managing the core processes within Flow 
Traders and are responsible for incorporating 
preventive and detective controls in the day-to-day 
trading and IT processes and for the continuous 
monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and trading 
controls.
The second line of defence is responsible for 
oversight and monitoring of risks, rules and 
requirements. Risk Management, Compliance and 
Finance manage risks through a combination of 
preventive and detective controls. Together they are 
responsible for the continuous risk management of 
Flow Traders.
The third line of defence is formed by Flow Traders’ 
Internal Audit Function (IAF). They provide 
independent and objective assurance and advice on 
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk 
management and control systems. It achieves this 
through the competent application of systematic and 
disciplined processes, expertise, and insight. It 
reports its findings to management and the 
governing body to promote and facilitate continuous 
improvement. The IAF carries out its audit work in 
accordance with the approved and implemented 
Group Internal Audit Charter.

## Page 58

The annual risk management cycle follows the below 
risk management framework:
Every year the Executive Committee sets its 
business targets following the strategic goals. The 
strategic goals are generally formulated in 
November/December. The Board approves the 
strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Board is involved in the strategy 
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets 
are then translated into annual company-wide, 
departmental and individual goals and discussed in 
an annual meeting with the Executive Committee 
and all relevant Managing Directors.
Based on the targets and objectives, the Executive 
Committee formulates the risk appetite of the 
company. The targets, objectives and risk appetite 
give direction to the various departments within 
Flow Traders and are used to derive the company’s 
strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management cycle is 
implemented to manage our residual risk profile to 
remain in line with our risk appetite. To help achieve 
this, we perform Risk Self Assessments to identify 
and assess current or emerging risks. Following the 
Risk Self Assessments, department heads in 
cooperation with the Executive Committee will 
decide on the appropriate risk response. The effects 
of the chosen risk responses will be monitored and 
the actual residual risk profile will be mapped versus 
the appetite annually.

Risk reporting
Flow Traders have a standing Risk Committee that 
continuously assesses the risks we face in our 
business, and is comprised our Global Head of Risk 
and certain members of the Executive Committee. 
Aside from regular ongoing communication, there is 
a formal monthly meeting in which we discuss all 
risk assessments and risk proposals related to 
position limits, strategies, procedures, liquidity and 
capital requirements and other requests from prime 
brokers and due to market developments. Any 
material change to our risk profile, systems, 
strategies and limits must subsequently be approved 
by the Executive Committee. 
In addition to this standing Risk Committee, we have 
a Risk Committee of the Board. All members of the 
Board are members of this Risk Committee. The 
Executive Committee informs the Risk Committee of 
the Board about the effectiveness of the internal risk 
management and control systems. This includes the 
reasonable assurance that the aforementioned 
systems do not contain any material inaccuracies. 
The tasks of the Risk Committee of the Board 
includes supervision and monitoring, as well as 
advising the Executive Committee on the operation 
of the company’s internal risk management and 
control systems. The Risk Committee is also 
responsible for providing advice to the Executive 
Committee on the company’s development, 
performance, and sustainability of its trading 
strategies, as well as reviewing the risk of the 
company. 
It also maintains regular contact with the company’s 
Trading and Risk and Operations departments. 
For more information on the responsibilities of our 
Risk Committee, please see the chapter "Our 
governance".
The monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems was previously 
identified as a priority. This is a joint responsibility of 
the Supervisory Board and its committees. Good 
progress has been made and the Board continue to 
oversee progress on this matter.  
All risks relevant to each of the committees of the 
Board are monitored in the Risk Committee of the 
Board. This means that the relevant items set out in 
best practice provision 1.4.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code have been discussed by the Board 
in 2022, as all members of the Board are members 
of the Risk Committee. 
For more information, please refer to the chapter 
"Report of the Supervisory Board".
Key risks
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from 
unfavourable market movements in various drivers 
of a security’s price that may result in a financial 
loss for its holder. 
For illustration, the value of a financial instrument 
may fluctuate because of changes in factors such as 
equity prices, currency rates, future dividend 
expectations, interest rates and volatilities. 
Our hedging strategies (typically implemented by a 
combination of underlying securities and vanilla 
derivatives) along with our continuous monitoring of 
our positions aim to minimise this risk. 
Our trading philosophy is that we hedge our 
positions as perfectly as possible to minimise our 
market risk exposures.
Market activity risk (business risk)
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of 
the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in 
the financial instruments in which we trade, and the 
bid-ask spreads (which largely determine the profit 
on the trade, or margins, we capture). 
Trading volumes in securities, derivatives, 
currencies, commodities, digital assets and other 
financial instruments on exchanges and in other 
trading venues worldwide are directly affected by 
factors beyond our control, including economic and 
political conditions, broad trends in business and 
finance, regulatory requirements, actions by central 
banks, and changes in the markets in which such 
transactions occur.
To cope with periods of low market activity, we have 
diversified our trading into different products and 
across multiple markets. This is to safeguard that we 
are not overly dependent on market activity in one 
particular asset class or product type. 
A key market and counterparty credit event that 
occurred in 2022 was that of the FTX platform's 
collapse due to the misbehaviour by their senior 
leaders and mismanagement of the firm. This 
resulted in a significant test of our digital asset 
trading ability and our new digital asset risk 
management approach. Due to the actions of our 
trading desk and risk management approach, we 
reduced our exposure significantly in short order. 
We suffered an immaterial impact from direct 
exposure to the FTX platform and this was then 
offset by gains in other parts of the digital assets 
space as volatility increased.

Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, 
systems or external events. Operational risk 
management is an integral part of Flow Traders’ risk 
and control systems. Our operational risk is 
dominated by technology-related events at our 
exchanges and clearing members. Therefore,  the 
level of our investment in technology is important to 
mitigate those associated risks as well as having 
resilient and robust internal systems and controls. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, high-
performance and customised technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new 
hardware and software. 
Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement 
improvements in both hardware and software on an 
ongoing basis. Controlled releases of hardware and 
software enhancements provide for minimal 
disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or 
updates of our trading software) is being developed 
is strictly separated from the environment in which 
such trading software operates in production. Access 
to the source code is strictly controlled and limited. 
Prior to any releases relating to our trading 
software, or an update into our production 
environment, any element of our trading software is 
subjected to a review of its code, testing in a 
development environment that is separate from our 
production environment, validation in limited 
production (processing a strictly limited number of 
trades) on one trading desk in respect of trading a 
single financial instrument, followed by more 
extensive testing across multiple desks and/or 
trading multiple financial instruments. Each step 
must be completed before the next and also 
appropriately documented. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control 
undisrupted trading activities in real time. Multilayer 
monitoring is employed to avoid errors. When an 
error does occur, the relevant teams are 
immediately notified via multiple different channels. 
We rely on multiple third party service providers for 
business and market data, which is a key part of 
what is monitored. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with 
our proprietary technology platform, analysing real-
time pricing data, and is designed to ensure that our 
order activity is conducted within strict pre-
determined trading and position limits. 
For example, our pre-trade [risk] controls are 
designed to prevent the trading engines from 
sending quotes that deviate from our pre-defined 
risk parameters. These include price and volume 
limits, which are set by our Risk Management 
department. This keeps our ordering, trading and 
positions well within our preset tolerance levels. Our 
post-trade monitoring tools include trade-level 
reconciliation of prices and positions against those of 
our exchanges and prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to 
penetration tests by external experts. We have a 
comprehensive IT security system that is designed 
to protect us from attacks both from internally and 
externally. 
Where we have a technical interface with institutions 
such as our prime brokers and exchanges, the 
integrity of the connection between the systems and 
the data that is being exchanged is subject to prior 
conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place 
which, we continuously review to ensure it 
adequately captures relevant scenarios. For the 
lessons that we have learnt from the COVID-19 
global pandemic, we have already made substantial 
changes to our global approach to our site 
management. 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we 
start trading on any new platforms, including 
platforms designated for trading digital assets. While 
many of these platforms remain unregulated, many 
have strongly improved their own onboarding 
procedures and counterparty identification 
procedures. While we believe our own procedures 
are strong, the unregulated status of these 
platforms and their location in emerging economies 
makes them inherently less institutionalized and 
supervised than regulated platforms in developed 
economies.
Regulatory risk
We only serve institutional counterparties and do not 
provide investment services or ancillary services to 
third parties, our markets and nearly all aspects of 
our business are highly regulated. Where applicable, 
entities forming part of our Group have obtained the 
regulatory licenses and approvals needed to operate 
their regulated businesses.
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in 
three international jurisdictions with branch offices 
established in London, Milan, Shanghai and Paris. As 
a Group, we currently trade on more than 180 
venues worldwide as well as operating on numerous 
other venues through our brokers. Our regulatory 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   60


---

## Page 61

landscape is broad as we have to comply not only 
with our local regulations, but also the trading rules 
of all venues on which we trade. 
Legislators and regulators worldwide continue to 
closely supervise the world financial markets in 
which we operate. This places significant demand on 
Flow Traders to maintain a professional, well-
structured and compliant organisation. 
We are awaiting the final approval from the Financial 
Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the UK to migrate the 
activities of our branch office in London to a new 
legal entity.
Our Compliance department supports management 
and operations at Group and local level by 
identifying, advising on, reviewing and reporting on 
regulations. It also seeks to maintain a compliant 
business environment through staff training and 
monitoring in order to manage the Group’s 
conformance with its regulatory obligations.
Compliance together with Public Affairs monitors and 
assesses any forthcoming regulations that may 
impact us. During 2022 this included amongst others 
matters: 
▪
The EC review of the European Central Securities 
Depositories Regulation that was adopted on 16 
March 2022 . Amendments on the mandatory 
buy-in regime in the Settled Discipline Regime 
(SDR) by proposing a "two-step approach". We 
will continue to monitor the future impact of 
mandatory buy-ins and to manage the two-way 
flow of cash penalties for failed transactions.
 
▪
The official response from the EP to the MiFID/
MiFIR review that was announced by ESMA in 
2021 has been published.  This review aims to 
further improve the framework introduced by 
MiFID II. One of the key components is the post-
trade consolidated tape that should be real-time 
and not include any deferrals.  We are and have 
engaged with regulators and various 
stakeholders to continue our push for 
transparency in all markets we are active in.
▪
We have implemented IFR/IFD and submitted our 
first ICLAAP under this new prudential regime to 
the DNB. We have received minor pointers from 
the DNB and AFM around a few points that they 
would like to be set out in a clear way in our next 
ICLAAP. We will continue to implement best 
practice in this area where possible. Such 
conversations with our regulators and our peers 
are ongoing and will continue as this regulation 
matures along with any further interpretation by 
the EBA and DNB. 
▪
Digital Assets and related forthcoming 
regulations such as the prudential BIS paper, 
MiCA and DORA remain a topic that garners 
significant attention. There is still a spread of 
approaches taken by various governments and 
regulators from around the globe for this 
developing asset class. As a world-class liquidity 
provider we continue to following these 
developments closely and remain an active 
contributor to key regulatory consultations. We 
anticipate the regulatory uncertainty will continue 
for into 2023 and beyond. We are engaging with 
regulators on a global and local level to push for 
a clear and fair regulatory framework as that 
should lead to a mature ecosystem with 
sustainable growth for this asset class.  
The Compliance, Risk and Operations departments 
have promulgated and implemented controls, 
internal rules and processes that have been 
pragmatically developed following applicable 
regulatory requirements, guidelines from market 
authorities, and industry best practices. 
Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that laws and 
regulations are subject to change and will be 
interpreted differently in practice over time. 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable 
laws or regulatory requirements could adversely 
affect our reputation and in turn our long-term 
profitability and future business prospects. This may 
also be the case to a lesser degree for differences in 
interpretation or lack of timely or complete 
implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, 
disgorgements and censures, suspension or 
expulsion from trading venues or the revocation or 
limitation of licenses. 
We aim to minimise such risks by focusing 
considerable management attention to choose the 
most appropriate strategic approach, 
employing ;highly-qualified compliance and risk 
professionals to allow the deployment of staff 
training; to efficiently update of our monitoring and 
reporting systems; and to be able to continuously 
evaluate the impact of current and upcoming 
regulations on our operations to find the optimal 
path to evolve our processes. 
Notwithstanding such efforts and given the highly 
regulated nature of our business, we remain subject 
to routine (and more targeted) inquiries and audits 
from our global regulators and our trading venues. 
The outcome of such inquiries are difficult to predict 
and manage, however we aim to be as transparent 
as possible in the spirit of cooperation to facilitate a 
better understanding of how we manage risk.

"Remuneration".
Environmental risk
While Flow Traders considers its overall impact on 
the environment to be low due to the office-oriented 
nature of our business, we have nonetheless 
identified certain environmental risks: 
▪
Physical environmental risks such as 
earthquakes, forest fires and floods could 
negatively impact our physical infrastructure. 
This is particularly relevant to our server 
locations, which are distributed globally. Climate 
change will likely lead an increase in extreme 
weather events in the future. We have and will 
mitigate this risk by having a widely distributed 
server infrastructure with a high degree of 
system redundancy. In addition, recent forest 
fires in South East Asia have led to the closure of 
our Singapore office. This was mitigated by 
activities transferring to other office locations.
▪
Future regulation may also affect Flow Traders 
financially by putting a price on CO2 and other 
greenhouse gas emissions, In addition, CO2 
pricing may have an impact on how seek to 
offset our carbon footprint in the coming years.
External risk
Given the highly interconnected nature of the 
financial markets ecosystem we are a part of, we 
recognise that should any of the risks referenced 
within this section materialise, there could be a 
negative impact on various external third parties.
Specifically, market and operational risk events 
could negatively impact key parties within our value 
chain; namely our counterparties and our prime 
brokers. There could limit our counterparties’ ability 
to trade with us or settlement trades effectively on a 
timely basis. Moreover, the various prime brokers 
we work closely with could also be exposed to 
similar risks.
Compliance and transparency
Focus on anti-bribery, anti-corruption 
and anti-money laundering
Flow Traders continues to be a strong proponent of 
effective, efficient and equal regulation and we 
contribute to the regulatory dialogue in our key 
jurisdictions to campaign for markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
We commit to complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations that apply to us, wherever we operate. 
Especially important are the rules around anti-
corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering.
Integrity and transparency is central to the way we 
run our business regardless of their seniority or role. 
The company encourages everyone, from our 
Management Board and Supervisory Board to all our 
staff, to speak up and participate in our firm's open 
culture. This inclusive culture supports our 
employees  in complying with the applicable laws, 
regulations and our internal policies. 
We believe that each employee of Flow Traders has 
an individual as well as collective responsibility for 
ensuring an honest and ethical conduct of business 
within the company. Our Code of Conduct, which 
forms part of our employment documentation, is the 
formalisation of our behavioural  values. 
Ensuring adherence with our Code of Conduct is the 
responsibility of the Executive Committee. Any 
reported potential breaches are investigated fully by 
the Executive Committee and other members of our 
senior management team in accordance with 
existing clearly laid out procedures and policies. 
Our Code of Conduct can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
We also have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-
money laundering (AML) policies in place that apply 
to all our staff. We expect our counterparties, 
business partners, intermediaries, contractors and 
subcontractors to adhere to the same standards. We 
believe that the risk of bribery or corruption is very 
limited as we do not hold or manage client money or 
assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain 
production facilities or source raw materials. 
Nevertheless, our staff receives training in anti-
bribery, anti-corruption and AML practices, as the 
Management Board would like to reinforce the 
importance of these policies.
Key to our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy is 
that officials or counterparties that we work with 
may never be placed in an uncomfortable position. 
Therefore, no gifts nor favours that may lead (or 
have the appearance to lead) to obligations or 
embarrass any recipient, and no gifts nor favours of 
any substantial value may be given to any  
authorities or counterparties that we interact with. 
Any form of facilitation payments are strictly not 
permitted under any circumstances. We provide 
clear and recurring guidance on a regular basis in 
that respect. 
As part of our constant monitoring, all expenses and 
gifts relating to external parties are checked by 
senior managers and employees must state the 
purpose and recipient of an expense.

We have zero tolerance approach towards bribery 
and corruption and we actively ensure that no such 
behaviour occurs. No cases of bribery or corruption 
were reported in 2022.
Whistleblowers
In addition to our culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have a mature and 
detailed Whistleblower Policy in place for all staff 
and relevant contractors, approved by the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. 
Employees are free to raise issues and have the 
responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, or 
any reasonable suspicions. 
All employees are required to participate in an online 
course on the Whistleblower Policy, as part of the 
Flow Academy, to create awareness and guidance on 
how to deal with misconducts and incidents 
described in Flow Traders whistleblower policy. 
Circumstances may arise that cause an employee to 
feel insecure or unsafe to the extent that they may 
not want to use their usual reporting lines. We also 
provide employees with a safe way of reporting any 
suspected misconduct within our organisation and 
offers robust protection to them. 
The Whistleblower Policy has wide applications, 
including in respect of topics such as fraud, market 
abuse, corruption, anti-money laundering, theft, 
bribery, dishonouring the organisation, global tax 
policy and any other structural misconduct that 
threatens the integrity and proper business conduct. 
The Whistleblower Policy also provides any 
whistleblower with anonymity, confidentiality, and 
the company will not impose sanctions on disclosure 
(or affect an employee’s legal position) when the 
employee reports a suspected misconduct in good 
faith, unless the employee is involved in the issue 
that is being reported. We respect a non-retaliation 
policy when a suspected misconduct is reported. Our 
Whistleblower Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit (IA) Function seeks to enhance 
and protect organisational value by providing risk-
based and objective assurance, advice, and insight. 
An efficient and effective IA contributes to strong 
internal controls and to a robust  governance 
structure, which can address key structural risks. 
The scope of IA's work includes the examination and 
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of our’ 
risk management, control and governance 
processes. It also includes quality assurance work 
reviewing our performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve our stated goals and 
objectives.
Our Group Internal Audit Charter defines the IA’s 
purpose, authority, responsibility and position within 
the organisation. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance 
provided by the Institute of Internal Auditors.
The IA function is an integral part of our reporting 
cycle. The Internal Audit Function reports to the 
Audit Committee and to the CEO. It aligns its efforts 
with our external auditor and reports its audit results 
to the Management Board, the Audit Committee and 
informs the external auditor.
The Management Board assesses the way in which 
the IA function fulfills its responsibility annually and 
takes the opinion of the Audit Committee into 
account. 
Flow Traders Internal Audit Function conforms to the 
International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) 
of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and was 
externally certified in 2022.

Functioning of the Board
The Board is responsible for the continuity of the 
company and is guided by the interests of the 
company and its associated business, taking into 
consideration the company’s long-term value 
creation and the interests of the company’s 
stakeholders, including our employees and our 
shareholders, as defined in the Bye-laws as 
stakeholder interests. This ensures decisions are 
made in a balanced manner.
The Executive Directors are primarily charged with 
the Company's day-to-day operations, subject to the 
limitations set out in the Companies Act and the 
Bye-laws. Two Executive Directors can jointly 
represent the company, reflecting the four-eyes 
principle we operate across the company: two 
persons must sign off on business decisions. The 
Board may further allocate the duties of the 
Executive Directors among the Executive 
Directors.The Executive Directors may submit 
resolutions that can be adopted on behalf of the 
Board by one or more Executive Directors, or be 
delegated by the Board in accordance with the Bye-
Laws to the Executive Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors are primarily charged 
with the supervision of the performance of the duties 
of the Directors and assist the Executive Directors by 
providing advice and direction. The Non-Executive 
Directors' duties specifically include the supervision 
of how the Executive Directors implement the 
Company's strategy. The Board Rules include further 
detail on the implementation of responsibilities and 
tasks of the Non-Executive Directors, amongst 
others with respect to decision-making of the Board 
on several matters, inter alia, nomination of 
Directors, remuneration of Directors and selection 
and nomination of the external auditor.
The Board appointed Rudolf Ferscha as Chairman. 
The Chairman shall act as main contact for the 
Directors regarding the functioning of the Board. The 
Chairman is primarily responsible for the functioning 
of the Board and its committees and is responsible 
for ensuring the proper conduct of business at 
meetings of the Board in order to promote a 
meaningful discussing at meetings. As a general 
rule, the Chairman presides over the General 
Meeting.
In case of a conflict of interest, under the N.V.'s 
governance structure, the Supervisory Board was 
responsible for the decision-making on how to 
handle conflicts of interest. In 2022, there have 
been no cases of conflicts of interest, transactions 
between the company and members of the 
Management Board or Supervisory Board, or 
transactions with shareholders holding at least 10% 
of the shares of Flow Traders.
At least annually, the Board shall evaluate – without 
the presence of the Executive Directors – the 
functioning of the Board, the committees and the 
functioning of the individual Directors, shall discuss 
the conclusions of such evaluations, and shall 
identify aspects where the Directors require further 
training or education. 
At least annually, the Executive Directors shall 
evaluate their own functioning. The Executive 
Directors may invite one or more Non-Executive 
Directors to participate in the evaluation or part 
thereof. 
The composition of the Supervisory Board of Flow 
Traders N.V. did not undergo any changes 
throughout the financial year 2022. The composition 
of the Management Board of Flow Traders N.V. 
changed twice throughout the financial year 2022, 
with Thomas Wolff having resigned from his position 
as per 29 April 2022 and Britta Achmann having 
resigned from her position as per 30 November 
2022. Following 2022 year-end, the composition of 
the Supervisory Board of Flow Traders N.V. changed 
as a result of Ilonka Jankovich having resigned from 
her position as per 13 January 2023. Finally, 
following 2022 year-end the composition of the 
Board changed as a result of Mr. Dennis Dijkstra 
having decided not to seek reappointment as Chief 
Executive Officer and Executive Director after having 
been part of Flow Traders since 2009. Effective 1 
February 2023, Mike Kuehnel assumed the role of 
Chief Executive Officer.
Nomination, Election, Suspension and 
Removal of Directors
Executive Directors
As set out in more detail in our Bye-Laws and Board 
Rules, nominations can be made at any meeting of 
the Shareholders either (i) by the Board or (ii) by 
shareholders, providing these shareholders hold 
three per cent (3%) of the Company's outstanding 
share capital or such lower number as is prescribed 
by the Companies Act. Following a nomination by 
the Board, a Director shall be elected by a simple 
majority of votes cast representing more than one-
third (1/3) of the then outstanding shares that are 
entitled to vote on the matter. If two or more 
nominees receive the same number of votes in 
favour, the nominee receiving the highest 
percentage of votes in favour shall be elected. If 
equal percentages are cast, no nominee shall be 
elected.  Following a nomination by shareholders, a 
Director shall be elected by a simple majority of the 
votes cast, representing at least half (1/2) of the 
then outstanding shares that are entitled to vote on 
the matter. The term of a proposed election shall not 
exceed four years, however, a proposal may provide 
that the term shall expire at the close of the first 
annual meeting of shareholders held after the 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   67

## Page 68

expiration of the four year term. There is no 
limitation in the duration of an Executive Director's 
entire service. 
In connection with a proposed (re-)appointment of 
an Executive Director, he or she will need to be 
assessed by the Dutch Central Bank on integrity and 
reputation in view of the qualified interest that Flow 
Traders Ltd. holds in Flow traders B.V.
The shareholders, on proposal of the Board may 
remove or suspend a Director from office. An 
Executive Director may also be suspended by the 
Board, which suspension shall end if three (3) 
months in aggregate have lapsed without a decisions 
taken on the termination of the suspension or 
removal. In case the removal or suspension is 
resolved on by shareholders but not on a proposal of 
the Board, such removal or suspension will require a 
simple majority of the votes cast, representing at 
least half (1/2) of the then outstanding shares that 
are entitled to vote on the matter, unless a 
Reflection Period is invoked. In case the removal or 
suspension is proposed by shareholders or is 
included on the agenda of a general meeting by a 
competent court, the Board may invoke a reflection 
period as further described in the Bye-Laws. 
Non-Executive Directors
The nomination, election, suspension and removal 
from office of Non-Executive Directors follow the 
same rules as noted above for Executive Directors, 
with the exception of the following. 
The consecutive term of a Non-Executive Director 
shall expire at the closing of the first annual general 
meeting held after twelve (12) years have passed 
since their election. Following such expiration, a 
Non-Executive Director shall not be eligible for re-
election. Such consecutive term shall not apply to 
Non-Executive Directors elected in accordance with 
the nomination right provided for in the Relationship 
Agreement.
Non-Executive Directors may not be suspended by 
the Board without involvement of the shareholders.
Independence of Non-Executive 
Directors 
Best practice in terms of corporate governance 
prescribes that at most one of the members of the  
non-executive directors qualifies as a non-
independent and that the total number of non 
independent Non-Executive Directors should account 
for less than half of the total number of Non-
Executive Directors. Jan van Kuijk and Roger 
Hodenius, as founders of the company, were 
attracted to their role as Non-Executive Directors  
(former Supervisory Board members) because of 
their specific business-related expertise. They did 
not qualify as independent under the provisions of 
the Corporate Governance Code as they are former 
members of the Management Board of the 
Company, and because they represent shareholders 
of the Company owning an interest of over ten 
percent.
Independence of Committee members
As Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius did not qualify 
as independent Non-Executive Director as set out 
above, this also affected two committees of which 
they were members throughout 2022. Best practice 
in terms of corporate governance prescribes that 
more than half of the members of the Audit 
Committee and the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee should be independent. Both Jan van 
Kuijk and Roger Hodenius are members of the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee, implying 
that half (and not more than half) of its members 
were independent throughout 2022. 
Board Committees
The Board may from time to time establish 
permanent or ad-hoc committees.  As at the date of 
this report, the Board has established four 
committees: the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee, the Risk 
Committee and the Trading and Technology 
Committee. The way that each of the four 
committees operate is governed by their respective 
Committee Charters, which are publicly accessible 
on our website. Each of the committees has a 
preparatory and/or advisory role to the  Board. The 
Committee Charters provide for the possibility of the 
Board to delegate decision-making in writing to the 
Committees on matters that fall within their 
respective tasks and responsibilities. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee undertakes preparatory work 
for the Board’s decision-making regarding the 
supervision of the integrity and quality of the 
Company’s financial reporting and the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal risk management and 
control systems, where applicable together with the 
Risk Committee and / or the Trading and Technology 
Committee. 
The Audit Committee shall consist of at least two 
members. All members of the Audit Committee must 
be Non-Executive Directors. More than half of the 
members of the Audit Committee should be 
Independent Directors.
The Audit Committee shall be chaired by an 
Independent Director. The Audit Committee shall not 
be chaired by the Chairman or by a former Executive

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
On 21 September 2022, the Supervisory Board of 
Flow Traders N.V. approved and adopted the 
Company's Diversity, Equity & Inclusion policy (the 
"DEI Policy"), thereby replacing the Company's 
Equal Opportunity policy. The DEI Policy describes 
our culture and the values that we stand for. 
Additionally, it contains a set of targets and KPIs, 
some of which are included in our Bye-laws and are 
based on Dutch law (e.g. the 'wet ingroeiquotum en 
streefcijfers'), and some that are discretionary 
targets and/or KPIs which we feel strongly about.   
In our view, the policy contributes to good 
governance, as it reflects our objective to treat 
everyone equally during the hiring process and 
throughout their careers at flow Traders. flow 
Traders is committed to being a truly equal 
opportunity employer, by recruiting, retaining and 
promoting people based on merit, and merit alone. 
The company is a firm believer in the benefits of a 
diverse workplace and does not make any 
concessions to quality. The objective is to provide 
equal employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all 
employees, provided they perform highly. When 
positions become available, Flow Traders actively 
encourages all candidates to apply and ensure that 
the selection and retention processes are truly equal 
for all applicants and employees. This also holds true 
for the Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors. When it comes to diversity in the Board, 
Flow Traders adheres to the same principle of equal 
opportunity as set out above. When positions 
become available, we actively encourage all 
candidates to apply and ensure that the selection 
and retention processes are truly equal for all 
applicants and employees. Our DEI Policy is publicly 
accessible via our website.
General Meeting, shares and 
shareholders 
Flow Traders highly encourages shareholder 
participation in the decision-making of the General 
Meeting. It is of great importance to the company 
that its shareholders have an actual say in the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), and the company 
therefore encourages an open dialogue. Flow 
Traders ensures that the General Meeting is 
adequately provided with information.
In accordance with the Bye-laws and subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, the Company's 
Board shall convene and the Company shall hold 
General Meetings as Annual General Meetings not 
later than six months after the end of the financial 
year. The Board may, whenever it thinks fit, and 
shall, when requisitioned by shareholders pursuant 
to the provisions of the Companies Act, convene 
General Meetings other than Annual General 
Meetings which shall be called Special General 
Meetings, at such time and place as the Board may 
appoint.
Subject to the Companies Act, a resolution may only 
be moved and put to a vote at a General Meeting if 
(i) it is proposed by or at the direction of the Board, 
(ii) it is proposed at the direction of a competent 
court, (iii) it is proposed on the requisition in writing 
by eligible shareholders, and (iv) the chairman of 
the meeting in their absolute discretion decides that 
the resolution may properly be regarded as within 
scope of the meeting.
Save as otherwise provided in the Bye-laws, at least 
two shareholders present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote on the matter representing the 
holders of at least twenty per cent, or the highest 
amount required from time to time by any stock-
exchange on which any of the shares are listed, of 
the issued share entitled to vote on the matter at 
such meeting shall be a quorum. Increased quorum 
requirements apply for the passing of certain 
resolutions requisitioned by shareholders or the 
resolution to elect, suspend or remove a Director.
Each shareholder present in person at a General 
Meeting shall be entitled to vote on any question to 
be decided on a show of hands or by a count of 
votes received in the form of electronic record 
(including by proxy), and each shareholder present 
in person or by proxy shall be entitled on a poll to 
vote for each share held by them. Each share carries 
one vote at a General Meeting. The AGM is the 
perfect place for shareholders and the Board to 
interact. At an AGM, shareholders can ask questions 
directly to the  Board. Our  Board strongly 
encourage shareholders to interact.
After a virtual AGM in 2021 due to COVID-19 
measures, the 2022 AGM was held physically again 
on 29 April 2022 at the Company's registered 
address. During this AGM,  all but one proposal on 
the agenda was adopted. The proposals adopted by 
the General Meeting related to: the adoption of the 
annual accounts, the determination of dividend, the 
2021 Remuneration Report, the discharge of 
Management Board and Supervisory Board 
members, the reappointments of Folkert Joling, Jan 
van Kuijk and Olivier Bisserier, the authority to issue 
shares, to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights, to 
acquire own shares and to cancel own shares, and 
lastly, the proposal to reappointed the external 
auditor. Even though a majority of the votes cast 
were cast in favour of the proposal to introduce a 
renewed remuneration policy, unfortunately, the 
proposal was not adopted because of the 
requirement to reach a 75% supermajority for this 
specific agenda item.

July 2022 and subsequently increased as per the

Traders in its former two-tier governance structure,

Board, the Supervisory Board and the General 
Meeting. The  Board values and considers the 
interests of the various stakeholders involved. Good

creation strategy, culture and risk. Following the

Board in control statement
The Executive Directors of Flow Traders are 
responsible for the design, implementation and 
functioning of Flow Traders’s internal risk 
management and control systems. Flow Traders’ 
internal risk management and control is a process, 
effectuated by the Executive Directors, senior 
management and other personnel. It is designed to 
mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the achievement of objectives in the 
following categories:
▪
Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
▪
Reliability of financial and non-financial 
information; 
▪
Compliance with laws, regulations and internal 
policies, 
▪
Safeguarding of assets, identification and 
management of liabilities; and
▪
Strategic goals of the Flow Traders group.
The Risk Management section as part of the Report 
of the Board elaborates on Flow Traders’ identified 
financial and non-financial risks and how these risks 
are managed. These chapters provide insight into 
the potential impact on the results of Flow Traders 
that come forth from these identified risks. The 
design and functioning of the internal risk 
management and control systems is based on the 
Flow Traders Risk Management Framework (RFM). 
The framework explained in detail in the Risk 
Management section, combine various financial and 
non-financial risk disciplines into a single converged 
approach and provide the businesses with an 
overview on their risks and the way these are 
managed. The Risk department assessed the 
controls in this process and reported its findings to 
the Board. These findings have been evaluated by 
the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. 
This view allows the Executive Directors and senior 
management to form an opinion on the adequacy of 
internal risk management and control systems 
regarding the risks they face while pursuing the 
Management Board’s strategy.
On the basis of the above and with due observance 
of the limitations stated below, we confirm that to 
the best of our knowledge:
▪
The annual report provides sufficient insights into 
any failings in the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems (see 
chapter Our governance);
▪
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial and tax reporting 
does not contain any material inaccuracies (see 
chapter Our governance);
▪
Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justified that the financial 
reporting is prepared on a going concern basis 
(see chapters Value creation and strategy, Our 
performance and Financial statements); and
▪
The report states those material risks and 
uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation 
of the company’s continuity for the period of 
twelve months after the preparation of the report 
(see chapters Value creation and strategy, Our 
performance, Our governance and Financial 
statements).
It should be noted that the above does not imply 
that these systems and procedures provide absolute 
assurance to Flow Traders as to the realisation of 
financial and strategic business objectives, or that 
internal risk management and control systems can 
prevent or detect all misstatements, inaccuracies, 
errors, fraud and non-compliances with legislation, 
rules and regulations.

Meetings of the Supervisory Board and its Committees throughout 
2022
During 2022, the Supervisory Board of Flow Traders 
N.V. held 25 formal Supervisory Board meetings and 
met several times without holding a formal meeting. 
Examples of meetings without holding a formal 
meeting include a preparation session for the AGM, 
education and strategy days and the self-
assessment day. During these meetings a variety of 
topics were discussed, including but not limited to 
the following:
The Company’s strategy 
The Management Board remained focussed on long-
term value creation and involved the Supervisory 
Board in setting strategic priorities and executing on 
its strategic agenda. The Supervisory Board 
regularly discussed strategic matters, including 
execution, implementation and any associated risks. 
Considerable effort was dedicated to assessing and 
discussing strategic initiatives and the Company's 
strategic growth agenda. An important example of 
such strategic initiatives is the Update of the 
Corporate Holding Structure, which was a regularly 
recurring topic due to its significance to not only the 
Company but also to the Company's stakeholders.
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the company’s risk assessment processes 
and the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems  continued to be a 
priority and joint responsibility of the Supervisory 
Board and all committees throughout the year 2022. 
The review amongst others entailed an overview of 
all relevant risks the company is exposed to, the 
internal controls in place to address these risks, and 
the Management Board’s views on such risks.
Succession planning and diversity
The term of both Jan van Kuijk and Olivier Bisserier, 
as Supervisory Board members, and the term of 
Folkert Joling as Management Board member 
expired in 2022. At the 2022 AGM, Jan van Kuijk 
was reappointed for another two year term, Olivier 
Bisserier was reappointed for another one year term 
and Folkert Joling was reappointed for another four 
year term (the chart below shows the terms and 
upcoming reappointments of the non-executive 
directors, i.e. the rotation schedule). 
On 29 April 2022, Thomas Wolff resigned from his 
position as member of the Management Board, and 
on 30 November 2022, Britta Achmann resigned 
from her position as a member of the Management 
Board. As such, succession planning of the 
Management Board has been an important topic. 
When discussing succession planning, the company’s 
Equal Opportunity Policy and Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion Policy was always taken into account.

Evaluation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of the 
2021 self-evaluation, and the follow-up on 
conclusions of that self-assessment. As a result of 
the conclusions of the 2021 self-assessment, it was 
agreed within the Supervisory Board to engage more 
regularly with the Management Board on strategic  
matters as well as more intensely monitor the 
Management Board’s strategy development 
initiatives. 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Supervisory Board  
evaluated its own functioning and that of its 
Committees and individual members, this time 
guided by external consultants who are subject 
matter experts in respect of Corporate Governance 
and Boardroom Dynamics. As a result of the 
conclusions of the 2022 self-assessment, it was 
agreed within the Supervisory Board to further 
cultivate productive and efficient board dynamics, 
including the effective distributions of roles and 
responsibilities. The 2022 self-assessment also 
included an independence-assessment which was led 
by Rudolf Ferscha as Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board and Linda Hovius as Chairwoman of the 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee. As a 
result of this independence-assessment, the 
Supervisory Board re-confirmed the independence of 
Olivier Bisserier, Rudolf Ferscha, Linda Hovius and 
Ilonka Jankovich. Roger Hodenius and Jan van Kuijk 
were considered non-independent Supervisory Board 
members.
Evaluation of the Management Board 
The performance of all members of the Management 
board has been discussed among the Supervisory 
Board and with each member of the Management 
Board individually, twice throughout the year 2022. 
During performance discussions, the representatives 
spoke with the Management Board members 
individually and with the Management Board as a 
whole. Guiding structures for these conversations 
included the Management Board KPI overview, the 
strategic agenda set for 2022, culture and team 
performance. Based on these discussions the 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee provided 
feedback regarding its view on the Management 
Board’s performance to the Supervisory Board, to 
guide year-end discussions on variable 
remuneration.

The committees reported to the Supervisory Board 
by sharing their advice and recommendations during 
the Supervisory Board meetings and by providing an 
update of the deliberations during the Supervisory 
Board meeting. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee met five times in 2022. Other 
attendees besides the Committee members included 
the CEO, the CFO, the Global Head of Finance, the 
Investor Relations Officer, the the Global Head of 
Internal Audit, the Global Head of Tax, the Global 
Head of Compliance and the external auditor.
During these meetings, the Audit Committee 
discussed the annual results, the half-yearly results 
and the quarterly results and shared the items 
discussed with the Supervisory Board. Other topics 
discussed include e.g. significant new and proposed 
legislative initiatives related to accounting, auditing 
and financial reporting, tax planning, tax strategy 
and monitoring, assessing whether there were 
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in 
internal control over financial reporting, the 
company’s financing strategy and capital 
management policy (including dividend proposals), 
assessing the company’s compliance with rules and 
regulations (including among others, CRR and IFR/
IFD), the company’s Code of Conduct and the 
methods used to assess the effectiveness of the 
internal and external audit processes. Topics 
discussed with the external auditor included the 
financial statements over the financial year 2021, 
recommendations on the basis of the annual report, 
their audit plan for the financial year 2022 and their 
interim review report. The Audit Committee 
reviewed the management letter and 
recommendations included in the auditor’s report, as 
issued by the external auditor and discussed the 
actions taken by management to address any 
recommendations and observations. The Audit 
Committee evaluated the performance of the 
external auditor and discusses this with the Board 
and subsequently with the external auditor. In light 
of this, the Audit Committee advised the  Board 
about the reappointment of the external auditor, 
before the Board determined EY's nomination for the 
appointment of the external auditor to the General 
Meeting of 2023. Given the nature of our business, 
the application of information and communication 
technology by the company, including risks relating 
to cyber security, are discussed in detail in the 
Trading & Technology Committee. Subsequently, key 
items in respect of these items are also discussed in 
the Audit Committee.
External auditor
The Audit Committee and the Management Board 
reported to the Supervisory Board on EY’s 
functioning as the external auditor, the company’s 
relationship with the external auditor, on its fees, as 
well as on other audit and non-audit services it 
provided to the company. EY performed a review of 
the company’s interim financial statements and 
issued an unqualified review report. The Audit 
Committee evaluated the qualifications, performance 
and independence of EY, taking into account the 
opinions of the Management Board. The Audit 
Committee also obtained a report from the external 
auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. EY confirmed its 
independence from Flow Traders in accordance with 
the professional standards applicable to it. Based on 
the information provided by the Audit Committee, 
the Supervisory Board nominated EY as external 
auditor at the company’s General Meeting in 2022. 
Subsequently, EY was reappointed by the General 
Meeting as external auditor for the financial year 
2022.

that form part of the internal audit plan, approved 
by the Supervisory Board. Focus areas in the 2022 
audit plan included amongst others trading, risk 
management, IT systems and adherence to 
regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee and 
the Global Head of Internal Audit discussed the audit 
results from 2022 (findings, observations, 
recommendations, management feedback and 
follow-up). The IAF also delivered an updated 
Internal Audit Charter as well as a risk based audit 
plan for 2023. The Audit Committee maintains 
regular dialogue with the IAF, particularly in relation 
to ongoing audits and outstanding audit items. More

Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee met 
eight times in 2022. Other attendees to the 
meetings included the CEO and the Global Head of 
HRM & Recruitment. During the meetings the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee discussed 
the company’s culture in general including feedback 
on the annual employee engagement survey, the 
General Remuneration Policy, and drafted proposals 
to the Supervisory Board for the remuneration 
practices to be pursued for the Management Board 
and staff of the company. It also discussed and 
further outlined proposals for the remuneration of 
the individual members of the Management Board 
for adoption by the Supervisory Board. The size, 
composition, functioning and succession planning of 
the Supervisory Board and Management Board was 
reviewed and findings reported to the Supervisory 
Board. Other duties included the monitoring of 
developments of the Corporate Governance Code 
and regulations in relation to remuneration policies 
and the preparation of the Remuneration Report. 
Before determining the remuneration of the 
Management Board members, the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee took note of the individual 
Management Board members’ views with regard to 
the amount and structure of their own remuneration.
Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee met twice in 
2022. As the core business of the company is 
discussed in this committee, all of the Supervisory 
Board members formed part of the Trading & 
Technology Committee. The committee addresses 
trading topics such as, but not limited to, the 
general market conditions, the (relative) 
performance of the trading desks across the various 
regions Flow Traders operates in, Flow Traders’ 
focus areas and growth strategies and also 
addresses technology topics, e.g. digital asset 
security for example and other developments 
concerning the crypto and broader digital asset 
space..
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met four times in 2022. 
Invitees of the meeting were the Management Board 
members and the Global Head of Risk or the Head of 
Risk EMEA. The main focus in the meetings was the 
Management Board’s risk assessment. The 
attendees discussed in detail the relevant risks the 
company is exposed to, the internal controls in place 
to address these risks, the Management Board’s 
views on such risks, as well as the effectiveness of 
the design and operation of the internal risk 
management and control system. The committee 
has discussed the way material risks and 
uncertainties have been analyzed and discussed, the 
ICLAAP and the Capital Requirement Regulation as 
well as the IFR/IFD regulation were also topics of 
discussion. More information can be found in the 
chapter Governance. 
Financial statements and dividend
The 2022 financial statements were prepared by the 
Board. They were discussed with the Audit 
Committee, in attendance of EY. The financial 
statements were audited by EY, who issued an 
unqualified auditor’s report. Reference is made to 
the auditor’s report of the financial statements. The 
Board approved the financial statements as audited 
by EY, including the company’s dividend proposal. 
We invite the General Meeting to adopt the financial 
statements for 2022.

Letter from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, I am pleased to present our 2022 
Remuneration Report. This report includes a 
summary of our remuneration policy currently in 
place, as approved at the 2016 AGM, and the 
remuneration paid out in 2022 in accordance with 
this policy. The remuneration report reflects the 
reporting requirements originating from the updated 
EU Shareholder Rights Directive and the Dutch 
implementation of this Directive. 
Additionally, following the completion of the update 
to the corporate holding structure, this report has 
been amended and simplified compared to previous 
years to align with this new international context. To 
aid transparency, this report provides additional 
information on our remuneration philosophy 
together with retrospective details of the new 
Management Board corporate scorecard introduced 
to assess performance more holistically. Historically, 
we have not disclosed any targets or actual 
achievement levels for our performance criteria. 
However, given the importance of this as expressed 
by our shareholders and the proxy advisors, we are 
now disclosing these levels for the KPIs identified in 
our scorecard. We anticipate that the new format 
and additional disclosures will help investors see the 
strong link between our remuneration philosophy 
and policy design.
Furthermore, this report provides the main proposed 
updates to our executive remuneration policy that 
we will submit to the 2023 AGM. The proposed 
remuneration policy contains several important 
changes compared with our current policy, while 
remaining aligned with our company culture and 
remuneration philosophy. We are proposing to 
enhance long-term value creation by formally 
introducing share-based compensation and 
enhanced deferral and vesting provisions. For an 
overview of the proposed changes please refer to 
page 88.
Stakeholder engagement following 
2022 AGM
In 2022, we put forward our revised remuneration 
policy for the Management Board and our 2021 
remuneration report (advisory vote) for the AGM’s 
approval. 60% of shareholders voted in favour of the 
remuneration report. The revised policy for the 
Management Board was approved by 57% of our 
shareholders, meaning it did not obtain the required 
75% supermajority from the AGM. As a result, we 
have continued to operate under the Remuneration 
Policy as approved in 2016. 
Following this voting result, the Committee has 
undertaken consultations with shareholders and 
proxy advisors. We have summarized the main 
feedback received together with how we have acted 
on this feedback below.
In addition, we have enhanced the disclosures 
around Management Board performance and the 
vesting schedules for deferred awards in this 2022 
remuneration report. 
We strongly believe in the proposed remuneration 
policy and have taken steps to ensure it is reflective 
of feedback received from our stakeholders. You will 
have an opportunity to vote on the proposals at the 
2023 AGM. If the policy does not receive the 75% 
support required, we will be obligated to continue 
with our existing policy as described in our policy at 
a glance section on page 90.
"We take our stakeholders 
views very seriously and 
welcome an open dialogue 
on all aspects of 
remuneration"

Main feedback from stakeholders
Ensuring long-term focus 
▪
Long-term value creation and share ownership 
are cornerstones of our remuneration philosophy. 
We propose to further align our remuneration 
policy with our philosophy and to defer a 
significant portion of variable remuneration  
(62.5%) for a multi-year period (up to 4 years). 
A significant portion (50%) of variable 
remuneration is paid out in equity and is subject 
to a holding period of one year post-vesting.
▪
In addition to operating above market standards 
clawback provisions, we propose to update our 
remuneration policy and introduce post-
termination vesting restrictions.
▪
We propose to update our remuneration policy 
and encourage our executive directors to retain 
50% of the shares granted as part of their 
remuneration (after tax) until cessation of 
employment. 
Formally capping variable compensation
▪
It is in our corporate DNA to share our profits 
fairly with our shareholders and employees, and 
we have done so since we were founded. The 
total variable remuneration pool available for all 
employees (including the Management Board) in 
2022 was capped at a maximum of 32.5% of 
operating result. We also propose to retain the 
hard cap on individual executive director total 
remuneration award levels (20 times versus 
average FTE total remuneration levels).
▪
This translated into a hard cap of €4,718,000 
total remuneration for each member of the 
Management Board in 2022. The total 
remuneration of each member of the 
Management Board was well within this limit.
▪
We have restructured our remuneration report, 
with the aim to better explain the design of our 
remuneration policy and in particular the 
philosophy behind our policy
Improved transparency and disclosure 
▪
Following shareholder feedback, we introduced a 
KPI scorecard for the Management Board with 
both financial and nonfinancial performance 
measures. The financial measures will allow for 
any remuneration awarded to consider multiple 
aspects of financial performance and not just 
operating profit, while non-financial measures 
will be selected to encourage sustained long-term 
performance.
▪
For each KPI identified, we are now 
retrospectively disclosing the targets and actual 
achievement levels.
▪
We have restructured our remuneration report, 
with the aim to better explain the operation of 
our variable remuneration plan. We have 
included more details on deferred variable 
remuneration and real value received in 
comparison to the theoretical value of the yearly 
Management Board remuneration awards. 
▪
We believe that these changes will increase 
transparency and certainty for shareholders.
Company performance and 
remuneration in 2022 
Flow Traders delivered an improved financial and 
trading performance in 2022 compared to 2021 
reflecting a more active market environment. We 
recorded Normalized Total Income in 2022 of €460.6 
million and demonstrated a healthy Normalized 
EBITDA margin of 45% with Normalized EBITDA of 
€208.2 million. Ultimately, we recorded a 
Normalized Net Profit of €150.2 million with 
Normalized Basic EPS of €3.45. This, along with our 
strong capital position, allowed the company to pay 
a total dividend of €1.50 per share to shareholders. 
The Supervisory Board, in close consultation with, 
and supported by, the Management Board has 
decided that the 2022 firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool will be €86.6 million (2021: €83.3 
million), corresponding to 32.5% of operating result 
in 2022. 
The Supervisory Board has also determined the 
2022 variable remuneration awards to the members 
of the Management Board in line with the 
recommendation from the Remuneration Committee 
(in accordance with the remuneration policy adopted 
at the 2016 AGM and being cognizant of the new 
policy proposed at the 2023 AGM). 
The performance of the Management Board has 
been reviewed against the corporate KPI scorecard, 
which includes both quantitative and qualitative 
targets as well as achievement of individual 
performance objectives. As a result of this review, 
the Supervisory Board has decided that 6.1% of the 
variable remuneration pool should be allocated to 
the Management Board.

Changes for 2023
As a result of a thorough legal and capital structure 
review and to support our aims in becoming more 
competitive as a global multi-asset liquidity provider, 
we completed an update to our corporate holding 
structure which includes a top holding company in 
Bermuda. We have retained our existing global 
footprint with no change to day-to-day operations. 
This includes a substantial presence in the 
Netherlands as well as maintaining a listing on 
Euronext Amsterdam. 
Our Board remuneration shareholder approval 
requirements remain unchanged through the holding 
structure changes. We continue to uphold the 
requirement to obtain 75% of shareholder approval 
for our Board remuneration policy which will be put 
to a vote at the 2023 AGM.
Following the updates to our holding structure, as 
required by Bermuda law, the top holding company 
now has a one-tier Board, comprised of executive 
and non-executive directors, including an 
independent Chairman.
On behalf of the Committee, I thank all shareholders 
for their constructive feedback, and we are looking 
forward to continuing our dialogue in 2023.

Flow Traders’ remuneration philosophy
We believe in operating a single & straightforward 
policy, where we reward all our employees, including 
the Management Board, based on the same 
remuneration policy. We do so, based on our 
remuneration philosophy and according to several 
defined principles. While we recognize that the 
corporate governance landscape has evolved in 
recent years, we believe that the principles that 
underline our approach remain relevant. The defined 
principles as described below guide the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee when 
making decisions on the remuneration policy and its 
implementation.
Profit sharing
It is in our corporate DNA to share our profits fairly 
with our shareholders and employees, and we have 
done so since we were founded. Given good 
performance employees from any role and office are 
entitled to receive variable remuneration relative to 
their contribution to the firm as a whole. 
We share one singular firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool. The total profit pool available for 
all employees and the Management Board is 32.5% 
of operating profit, the residual portion allocated to 
our shareholders.
Rewarding for exceptional performance
Our remuneration consists of a relatively modest 
base salary and a variable remuneration component. 
Positive company performance enables employees in 
any role to receive variable compensation relative to 
their contribution to the firm. The variable 
remuneration profit share that is paid out is partly in 
equity that directly reflects company and personal 
performance.
The pay-mix is skewed towards variable 
remuneration in good (financial) years. At the same 
time, if we make no profit, we do not pay-out 
variable remuneration – and reclaim outstanding 
deferrals if we sustain a loss.
Guarding long-term interests & 
stimulating risk awareness
We align employee pay with the interests of 
shareholders and our financial performance. Where 
Flow Traders is successful, the profits are shared 
with all stakeholders, including our employees. As 
such, variable pay is only possible in a year when a 
profit is made, and a significant part of any profit 
sharing (62.5%) is deferred for a multi-year period 
(up to 4 years) that remains at risk in full during this 
period. The cash component of the profit share vests 
on a pro-rata basis over a two-year period, with the 
first tranche vesting on the date of award. This 
aligns the interests of the company and its 
shareholders with those of our employees by 
building long-term value and creating ‘skin in the 
game’ as well as continued loyalty.
Where Flow Traders is less successful, there is a 
corresponding downwards impact on variable 
remuneration levels creating a risk aware culture 
and creating larger alignment with long term growth 
and reward (as deferred variable remuneration 
remains at risk until vesting).
Emphasizing share ownership
We see the advantages of employee ownership, 
ranging from positive effects on employee 
commitment (attracting and retaining employees), 
corporate innovation, our business performance 
(productivity and profitability as well as 
competitiveness to our peers), through greater work 
effort of employees and a more cooperative and 
entrepreneurial corporate culture.
Social responsibility
The company and its management believe in being a 
socially responsible company. Enabling equal 
opportunities and fostering ownership is embraced 
across all areas of how we do business. 
Flow Traders’ approach to Management 
Board remuneration
Our Management Board remuneration policy aims to 
attract, motivate and retain Management Board 
members to lead Flow Traders and sustainably 
execute Flow Traders’ strategy. We aim to provide 
total remuneration that is competitive with our 
predominantly international, and in many cases 
privately-owned, competitors and design our 
remuneration structures to encourage our 
employees to stay with us for the longer term. Our 
Management Board remuneration policy reflects our 
mission, corporate identity and values and fosters 
our unique Flow Traders culture. 
We provide our members of the Management Board 
a remuneration package that consists of fixed 
remuneration and variable remuneration. The 
Management Board does not receive material 
ancillary benefits beyond variable remuneration. As 
permitted by the remuneration policy, total 
remuneration of Management Board members is 
voluntarily capped at a multiple of the average 
employee total remuneration. We present detailed 
insights into our Management Board remuneration 
policy in the next section.

Management Board Remuneration at a glance
In accordance with our Remuneration Philosophy, we provide members of the 
Management Board with a remuneration package that consists of fixed 
remuneration, in the form of a relatively modest base salary, and variable 
remuneration that is aligned with company performance.
While our current policy has been last approved in 2016, we have since then 
made improvements within that policy. In 2021 and 2022 we have already 
reduced the policy maximum 40% of Flow Traders’ operating profit over the 
performance year being available for variable remuneration and in 2022 we have 
introduced a balanced scorecard to assess Management Board members’ 
performance. Within our proposed 2023 policy, we hope to formally implement 
these and other adjustments.
The table on the right provides further insight into the main elements of our 
existing remuneration policy, for an overview of our proposed remuneration 
policy please refer to page 91.

2022 Remuneration for the 
Management Board
Introduction
The remuneration (and other arrangements) for the 
members of the Management Board are determined 
by the Supervisory Board (following proposals from 
the Remuneration & Appointment Committee). The 
Supervisory Board has assessed the remuneration of 
the Management Board members based on their 
performance - both individual and as a team- and in 
accordance with company performance in 2022. A 
detailed explanation of the assessment is included in 
the "Performance assessment" section on page 93.
Total remuneration
The table below shows the total remuneration 
awarded to individual members of the Management 
Board in 2022.
▪
Flow Traders delivered an improved financial and 
trading performance in 2022 compared to 2021 
reflecting a more active market environment. We 
recorded Normalized Total Income in 2022 of 
€460.6 million and demonstrated a healthy 
Normalized EBITDA margin of 45% with 
Normalized EBITDA of €208.2 million. Ultimately, 
we recorded a Normalized Net Profit of €150.2 
million with Normalized Basic EPS of €3.45.
▪
We made significant progress in terms of 
executing our strategic growth agenda with the 
further expansion single bond market making 
activities, broadening and deepening our digital 
assets footprint and completing 16 strategic 
investments via Flow Traders Capital.
▪

into a larger variable remuneration pool in 2022 
compared to 2021. The firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool in 2022 represents 32.5% of 
the operating result, in line with the existing 
remuneration policy. The Management Board has 
been awarded 6.1% of the variable remuneration 
pool in 2022.
▪
In line with the proposed cap on total 
remuneration in the 2022 remuneration policy, 
the hard cap on total remuneration for each 
Management Board member in 2022 is 
€4,718,000. The cap is based on average 
employee total pay of €235,900, calculated 
according to the recommendation of the Dutch 
Monitoring Commission.

1.As shareholders have not approved to award actual shares, members of the Management Board receive share-like instruments.
2. Prior to their appointment into the Management Board, Chief Trading Officer Folkert Joling and Chief Technology Officer Thomas Wolff had participated in the Flow Traders Cash Incentive Plan 2017 (FCIP 2017). Under the FCIP 
plan rules they were offered the opportunity to buy Company shares and receive an annual cash incentive over a five-year period. The right to these incentives would have been forfeited due to ceasing to be an employee and 
becoming a member of the Management Board in April 2018. However, special permission has been granted to both Management Board members to remain entitled to the incentive rights under the FCIP plan rules in respect of the 
shares bought under the FCIP at the time they were an employee of Flow Traders rather than a member of the Management Board. As a result, they have both received €8,000 annual cash incentive. 
3. Thomas Wolff stepped down as member of the Management Board as of 29 April 2022. The remuneration granted in capacity as CTO is shown in the table above. Given the resignation, the deferred cash award granted in 2021 in 
the amount of  €200,000 has been forfeited. No variable remuneration has been granted in 2022. 
4. Britta Achmann stepped down as member of the Management Board as of 30 November 2022. The remuneration granted in capacity as CRO is shown in the table above. Given the resignation the share-like instruments awarded in 
2022 were forfeited and only 25% of the unvested share-like instruments of the prior year grants will vest before the vesting date.

Base salary
None of the members of the Management Board 
received a base salary increase during 2022. The 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Chief Trading Officer continued to receive a modest 
annual base salary for the size of their role and 
responsibilities of €94,608, while the Chief Risk 
Officer received an annual base salary of €200,000. 
Variable remuneration
The design of our variable remuneration reflects our 
remuneration principles. We operate a single 
incentive plan that drives and rewards both annual 
and long-term performance with a significant focus 
on the long-term through the multi-year pay-out 
mechanism and half of the award being paid in Flow 
Traders equity.
In line with our guiding principles, the members of 
the Management Board share in the same firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool as all other employees. 
This pool of variable remuneration is primarily a 
function of operating results. While this structure is 
uncommon among listed companies, it is in line with 
the practice in our industry among both listed and 
non-listed peer companies, and necessary to be able 
to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the 
highest calibre.
Management Board performance 
assessment
To determine the Management Board's variable 
remuneration awards, the Supervisory Board 
conducts a holistic assessment of the performance of 
each Management Board member and the 
Management Board as a whole in accordance with a 
defined scorecard. In this holistic performance 
assessment, the Supervisory Board considers 
performance against company targets, which 
includes both financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs). To ensure a balanced 
assessment, our KPIs do not have pre-determined 
weightings, allowing the Remuneration Committee to 
determine the overall outcome and ensure 
appropriateness in wider circumstances. Objectives 
for the KPIs included in the scorecard are set prior to 
the beginning of the year and where appropriate 
quantitative targets are predefined to ensure the 
assessment is robust. Individual performance is 
assessed alongside company performance to 
determine the final variable compensation outcomes.
Below we present the company KPIs and the 
explanation on the performance assessment as 
conducted for 2022.
Performance assessment 
Flow Traders introduced in 2022 a scorecard which 
demonstrates company performance through six 
specific performance criteria. The criteria were 
chosen to align with our business, our strategy and 
include a range of financial and non-financial 
metrics. 
During the course of numerous engagement 
sessions with stakeholders around executive 
remuneration, it was indicated that information 
should be provided in order for executive 
performance and the resulting remuneration 
outcomes to be assessed more thoroughly. 
Accordingly, in addition to providing insights into the 
specific performance criteria applied, we have also 
presented the targets and actual results for 2022 on 
the defined performance criteria. 
The criteria were set ahead of the performance 
period, ensuring that the achievement of targets is 
challenging, and were as follows: 
1. Median daily net trading income 
(NTI) normalized for volatility:
We believe that the median daily NTI normalized by 
volatility provides a statistically clean picture of 
overall business growth. The distribution of daily NTI 
is not normally distributed but more shaped like a 
Poisson or Gamma distribution with a few negatives 
days and more higher profitability days. Due to the 
fact that the higher profitability days are 
independent, a simple average of daily NTI is 
statistically less relevant than the median of the 
daily NTI. It is Flow Traders’ ambition to increase 
this median NTI for equal volatility scenarios. 
Therefore, it is necessary to normalize the observed 
daily NTI by the volatility. Since volatility does not 
have a linear effect, but a moderately exponential 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   93


---

## Page 94

impact, it has been determined that the most 
appropriate calculation option is to divide the daily 
median NTI by the root of the volatility. 
This exercise has been performed on the last 56 
quarters and the average VIX value has been used 
to normalize the NTI. It is important to note that for 
a business with a global footprint which is exposed 
to multiple different asset classes, VIX is a simplified 
proxy for overall volatility (VIX is the implied 
volatility of the S&P500). However, it does provide a 
measure of general market sentiment. The target 
value set by the company is to have this metric 
increase by 10 points every year which equals an 
increase of approximately €50,000 per trading day 
for the daily median for a volatility environment like 
the one seen in Q4 2022.
The target for this metric was set at 227 for 2022 
and we achieved an actual result of 277. Moreover, 
during the course of 2022, this metric was above the 
target in all four quarters with Q1 experiencing the 
largest level of outperformance.
2. Normalized EBITDA margin 
Normalized EBITDA margin is a profitability ratio 
that measures how much in earnings a company is 
generating before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortization, as a percentage of Net Trading 
Income. Normalized EBITDA and margin are based 
on the relevant profit share percentage of operating 
result for the relevant financial period without any 
IFRS 2 adjustments for share-based payments. 
On the cost side, Normalized fixed operating 
expenses increased to €161.6 million in 2022 (2021: 
€122.1 million). The main drivers of the increase in 
fixed expenses related to USD strengthening, base 
compensation increases, technology investments to 
support diversification initiatives as well as new 
hires. FTEs increased by 8% percent to 660. 
Normalized variable employee expenses increased to 
€90.8 million (2021: €86.5 million) which reflects 
the improved overall financial performance of the 
business during the year and the adjusted profit 
sharing percentage of 32.5% which was 
implemented to ensure the base compensation 
increases were income statement neutral.
A target Normalized EBITDA of 40% was set for 
2022. This is reflective of prior annual outcomes and 
is at a level which ensures a sustainable and 
growing business for all internal and external 
stakeholders. Flow Traders delivered a Normalized 
EBITDA margin of 45% (2021:46%) with Normalized 
EBITDA of €208.2 million (2021: €178.5 million). 
which was the result of the income and cost 
dynamics described above. Flow Traders continued 
to demonstrate strong operational leverage in 2022.
3. Average return on shareholders’ 
equity
The average return on shareholders’ equity shows 
how much money is returned to our shareholders as 
a percentage of the money that has been invested 
or retained in Flow Traders. It is calculated by 
dividing Flow Traders normalized net profit for the 
year by the average total shareholders’ equity for 
the year (i.e. the average of the opening and closing 
shareholders equity balances, expressed as a 
percentage). 
In 2022, Flow Traders recorded average return on 
equity of 27% reflecting normalized net profit of 
€150.2 million and average shareholders’ equity of 
€557.2 million. This compares to 24% average 
return on shareholders’ equity delivered in 2021. 
The realization of a 27% average return on equity is 
the result of a NTI performance during the year as 
well as the operating expenses dynamics which 
reflect both fixed operating expenses as well as 
variable employee remuneration which is determined 
by the 32.5% profit share arrangement. 
The target for executives has been set at 15% which 
is an approximation of Flow Traders’ cost of equity 
and steers towards delivering a return on 
shareholders’ equity that is greater than the 
company’s cost of equity.
4. Business development and 
diversification index
It is an ongoing goal of the company to further grow 
and diversify our trading activities each year, 
particularly in the context of the broader market 
volumes. An important component of our trading is 
off-exchange with institutional counterparties and 
these relationships are critically important as we 
diversify our trading into fixed income and across 
CCC which are products that are almost exclusively 
traded off exchange. Value traded, both ETP and 
non-ETP, indicate how we have grown and 
diversified our trading activities. Accordingly, we 
have developed a business development index which 
seeks to demonstrate how the business has 
developed and diversified over the relevant 
performance year.
This business development and diversification index 
provides a relative score based on an algorithm 
comprised of several input levers including the 
number of active counterparties, our own ETP value 
traded as well as non-ETP value traded and total 
market ETP value traded. At the end of 2022, Flow 
Traders had 1,165 active institutional counterparties 
compared to 1,082 at the end of 2021. In 2022, 
Flow Traders ETP value traded amounted to €1,775 
billion (2021: €1,541 billion) and Flow Traders non-
ETP value traded amounted to €4,989 billion (2021: 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   94


---

## Page 95

€4,209 billion). Global ETP market value traded was 
€51,811 billion in 2022 (2021: €36,835 billion).
Given these inputs and developments, Flow Traders 
scored 1.52 with regards to this index. This 
compares to a target of 1.45 (2021 index score).
5. Compliance awareness score 
The metric represents incidents that Compliance was 
made aware of on a timely basis that resulted in 
further action (e.g., document, escalation, and or 
remedial measures) and categorized by level of 
materiality.
Incident management was successful overall; issues 
were identified and escalated through transparent 
channels. Opportunities remain for improvement 
with respect to implementing cross-departmental 
enhancements and structural solutions rather than 
ad hoc improvements.
Flow Traders achieved a 100% outcome with respect 
to its compliance awareness score which is in line 
with the target set for the executives. All incidents 
were reported on a timely basis and Flow Traders 
relies on the procedures and training of the 
Compliance team to ensure any breach of 
obligations are sufficiently escalated and acted upon.
6. Engagement score 
This is the average score given by our employees in 
response to the main engagement question in our 
annual global employee engagement survey. 
Engagement is a measure of how committed and 
enthusiastic employees are about their work and the 
organization. When people are engaged, they feel 
more comfortable being themselves at work. 
Different factors contribute to employee 
engagement, including organizational culture, work 
environment, work relationships, and development 
opportunities.
On the engagement score, a 7.4 was scored, slightly 
below the target of 7.6. We do see it as our goal to 
increase the score vs the benchmark next year but 
also feel comfortable as the score is close to the set 
target only missing target with a few decimals.
2022 performance summary
Following from the above, the performance on the 
company scorecard in combination with the 
Management Board member’s individual 
performance has determined the individual variable 
compensation outcome. As mentioned, our KPIs do 
not have pre-determined weightings, allowing the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee to 
determine the overall outcome and ensure 
appropriateness in overall circumstances. As such 
we believe the variable compensation determined is 
set at a justified level. Aligned with our 
remuneration philosophy and our aim of long-term 
value creation, the variable compensation is partly 
paid out in share-like instruments deferred over 
multiple years.

2023 scorecard
The non-executive directors of the Board have 
determined that the six KPIs used to assess 
executive director performance in 2022 will be 
retained for the 2023 performance year. The specific 
targets relating to each of these KPIs are 
commercially sensitive and accordingly the target 
ranges and actual performance outcomes achieved 
will be disclosed retrospectively together with 
appropriate commentary in the next annual report.

Deferral and vesting of variable pay
We believe in creating a culture of ownership, risk 
awareness and entrepreneurial spirit and we 
embrace an approach which truly connects our 
people to the business in sharing profit and risk. To 
ensure that the variable remuneration award of the 
Management Board is aligned with our beliefs and 
contributes to long-term value creation and 
shareholder experience, 50% of the 2022 award to 
the Management Board is paid out in share-like 
instruments deferred over multiple years. This 
approach allows us to take a longer-term outlook on 
remuneration. The remaining 50% is settled in cash, 
paid in equal instalments in 2023 and 2024. As 
shareholders have not approved granting awards 
over Flow Traders’ equity as part of the Management 
Board’s remuneration, we have utilized share-like 
instruments for the equity portion, which will be 
settled in cash at time of vesting. The value of these 
instruments is directly linked to performance of the 
Flow Traders’ share price from the date of grant to 
vesting. Further, any outstanding variable 
remuneration (deferred or unvested) remains at risk 
in full for future years. All equity-based awards are 
subject to a holding period of one-year post-vesting. 
These accord with our culture and remuneration 
philosophy of encouraging management and 
employee share ownership, creating alignment with 
the company’s long-term success.

Comparative overview of company 
performance and remuneration
The long-standing foundation of our remuneration 
policy reflects a relatively modest base salary and 
variable remuneration that is aligned with company 
performance – which varies each year depending on 
successful or less successful (financial) years. This is 
clearly illustrated in the table below which shows the 
development of the company performance and the 
average (full-time) remuneration of executives and 
employees over the last 5 years. In addition, the 
table illustrates for the CEO what the actual amounts 
received were in each given year. As a noteworthy 
part of the remuneration is deferred over multiple 
years plus the fact of differences in share prices at 
vesting vs. originally awarded years, the actual 
amounts received by our executives differs from the 
total remuneration awarded significantly.
Internal pay ratios
The 2022 pay ratio (CEO total pay vs average total 
employee pay) is 7.61 compared to 6.80 in 2021. 
This is well below the cap of 20 times average total 
employee pay.

Scenario analyses 
The Remuneration Committee conducts an annual 
scenario analysis when determining the structure 
and level of Executive Board remuneration, in 
accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance 
Code.
No pensions, loans and other benefits
In 2022, no personal loans, guarantees or related 
benefits were granted by the company to the 
members of the Management Board as part of their 
compensation package. No loans, guarantees or 
similar instruments to the members of the 
Management Board were outstanding on 31 
December 2022.
We have not reserved nor accrued any amounts to 
cover pension claims or retirement claims. We do 
not provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
member of the Management Board.
Clawback variable remuneration
Malus and clawback provisions are in place that are 
comprehensive, irreversible and substantially exceed 
regulatory requirements. No variable remuneration 
has been clawed back during 2022.
Temporary deviations from the 
remuneration policies
No temporary deviations took place from the 
respective policies in 2022.
Shares held by employees and 
Management Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, 
creating alignment between the company’s long-
term success and individual personal financial 
circumstances. Since IPO, we have utilized a number 
of share schemes. In connection with the IPO, our 
CEO and a significant number of current and former 
employees invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, 
the Flow Traders Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and 
Flow Traders Loyalty Incentive Plan (FLIP) were 
introduced. The FCIP was replaced in 2020 by a new 
share plan which provides for the award up to 50% 
of variable remuneration in shares (or share-like 
instruments).

2023 executive remuneration policy
At the 2023 AGM we will be submitting a proposed 
executive remuneration policy. We believe that our 
proposed remuneration policy is reflective of the 
feedback received at our stakeholder consultations 
while maintaining our core remuneration principles 
which aim to attract, retain and motivate the right 
talent from both listed and non-listed companies. 
Considering the feedback received, we are proposing 
to:
▪
Formally introduce share-based compensation;
▪
Enhance deferral and vesting provisions;
▪
Encourage share ownership; 
▪
Formally introduce a cap (max. 20x average 
employee total compensation) on individual 
Executive board member remuneration; 
The full proposed policy will be published in 
combination with our 2023 AGM convening notice on 
our website.
Supervisory Board remuneration
The remuneration policy for the members of the 
Supervisory Board was adopted by the AGM on 23 
April 2021 and applied from that date onwards. The 
table below shows the total fixed compensation 
awarded to the individual members of the 
Supervisory Board.

Remuneration for other employees
Variable Remuneration
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the 
beginning of each calendar year, clear objectives are 
set depending on an employee’s role, which are in 
line with our company objectives for the year and 
our corporate key competencies: drive, ownership 
and teamwork. Performance is reviewed twice during 
an annual cycle. 
Individual variable remuneration payable from the 
collective variable compensation pool is dependent 
on company and business unit performance, 
individual performance and the individual’s 
contribution to the long-term success of the 
company as a whole, discouraging a culture of ‘star’ 
behaviour and fostering collaboration and teamwork. 
Flow Traders does not base variable remuneration 
directly on financial results achieved individually. 
The Supervisory Board approves the awarding of 
variable remuneration.
If awarded, variable remuneration is paid in cash,  
company shares and company share linked 
instruments in one, two, three or four annual 
instalments, depending on the amount of variable 
remuneration awarded. The deferred variable 
component acts as a first loss tranche to 
compensate for any operating loss in the subsequent 
year, acting as a buffer before such loss would 
impact shareholder equity. This serves as an 
important incentive for risk-aware behaviour, 
focusing on the long-term objectives of the company 
and alignment with our risk appetite. We deem the 
deferral period sufficient given the company’s risk 
profile and horizon, see for further details of our 
remuneration philosophy on page 89.
▪
Variable remuneration components may become 
subject to reduction or claw back if it is 
determined that the relevant employee did not 
meet adequate norms of competence and 
appropriate behaviour or was responsible for 
behaviour that led to a substantial deterioration 
of the company’s position, in accordance with 
applicable law. 
▪
We do not award guaranteed variable 
remuneration to employees unless the 
guaranteed variable component is awarded in 
relation to hiring new staff, limited to the first 
year of employment, and only if we have a sound 
and strong capital base. 
▪
We do not award severance payments if there is 
a serious imputable act or negligence by the 
employee in the fulfilment of his or her function 
or where an employee resigns voluntarily (unless 
this is the consequence of a serious imputable 
act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar handelen 
of nalaten) by the company). 
▪
The company does not grant its employees any 
personal loans, guarantees or equivalent benefit 
as part of their compensation package. We do 
not provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
employee. We have not reserved or accrued any 
amounts to cover pension claims or retirement

Emphasizing share ownership
One of our core values is ownership, both in terms 
of mindset, behaviour as well as a share in the 
ownership of the company. We believe that being a 
shareholder aligns the interests of the company with 
those of our employees. Ever since the company 
went public and before, we have a history of offering 
our employees the opportunity to become 
shareholders. From 2017 untol 2019, we promoted 
shareholding through the Flow Cash Incentive Plan 
(FCIP). From performance year 2020 onwards, we 
have begun rewarding employees directly in 
company shares. The higher the variable 
remuneration an individual receives, the higher the 
proportion of variable compensation paid out in 
shares.
We are also maintaining our FLIP (Flow Loyalty 
Incentive Plan) program, whereby we award 
company shares to employees marking their two-
year anniversary with the company. Shares awarded 
under the FLIP are subject to a lock-up period and 
cannot be forfeited by the employee regardless of 
the termination of his or her employment with Flow 
Traders. All shares awarded to employees, are fully 
paid out from the variable compensation pool. The 
terms and conditions of the employee share plans 
are subject to review by the Management Board 
annually. As a part of these plans, shares have been 
and will be bought in the market.
Pension
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. 
At our headquarters in Amsterdam, we partner with 
a pension provider, giving employees the freedom of 
choice to select the option that best suits their 
individual needs while incentivizing participation in 
the company-sponsored program. In our other 
offices we offer schemes that are driven by country-
specific practices and regulations.

Changes in regulation
Remuneration regulations are naturally subject to 
change. For example, as of 22 November 2021, the 
European Banking Authority published a final report, 
setting out the “Guidelines on sound remuneration 
policies under Directive (EU) 2019/2034” which 
became applicable to investment firms, such as ours 
from 30 April 2022. These guidelines are intended to 
implement sound and gender neutral remuneration 
policies for all staff with specific provisions applying 
to certain identified staff. For such identified staff, 
the guidelines emphasizes that their variable  
remuneration must be aligned with the investment 
firm’s risk profile. We have reviewed these 
guidelines and have already determined that we are 
largely compliant, and as such, any impact on us will 
be minor. Nonetheless, we remain continually 
vigilant to any new changes as they may have a 
significant impact on the General Remuneration 
Policy, our global remuneration model and other 
remuneration practices of the company and its group 
companies. It may also impact our ability to attract 
or retain talent given the global and highly 
competitive nature of our industry.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1. Reporting entity
Flow Traders N.V. (referred to as the “Company”) is an public limited liability 
company (naamloze vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the  
Netherlands, having its seat (statutaire zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 
having its registered office at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9,1018 LL Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands and registered with the Trade Register of the Chamber of 
Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, afdeling Handelsregister) under number 
34294936.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). 
The Group is a leading technology-enabled global multi-asset class liquidity 
provider with its core business in Exchange Traded Products (ETP) actively 
expanding in fixed income, FX, commodities and digital assets, while 
systemically increasing its presence in the global ecosystem through strategic 
partnerships and investments.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the annual period ended 
31 December 2022 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders N.V., its 
subsidiaries and associates. The annual financial statements were authorized for 
issue by the Company’s Board on 23 February 2023 subject to adoption by the 
General Meeting of shareholders.
As of 13 January 2023 Flow Traders N.V. has been legally merged via a cross 
border legal merger into Flow Traders S.A., following this merger Flow Traders 
S.A. converted into a Bermuda Limited company, Flow Traders Limited with 
Flow Traders Limited as the legal successor as reporting entity of Flow Traders 
N.V.. Please refer to note 35 on subsequent events for further details.
2. Going concern 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the 
going concern assumption.
3. Basis of preparation 
a) Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (‘IFRS-EU’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS-EU 
provides several options in accounting principles. The Group’s accounting 
principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding the options available are set out 
in the section ‘significant accounting policies’ below.
b) Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also 
the functional currency of the parent company: Flow Traders N.V.. All financial 
information presented in Euros has been rounded to the nearest thousand, 
except when otherwise indicated.
c) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to form 
opinions and make estimates and assumptions that influence the reported value 
of assets and liabilities and of income and expenditure. The actual results may 
differ materially from these estimates. The estimates and the underlying 
assumptions are constantly assessed. Revisions of estimates are recognized in 
the period in which the estimate is revised. For more details, we refer you to 
the chapter on fair values of financial instruments, other assets and liabilities 
and share based payments. The accounting treatment of all aspects of the 
digital assets and blockchain industry have not yet been addressed by current 
IFRS guidance. The Company is required to make significant assumptions and 
judgments as to its accounting policies and the application thereof, which are 
disclosed in the note 6 New standards and interpretations, note 7 changes in 
presentation, note 8  fair values of financial instruments and other assets and 
liabilities held  for trading and note 34 financial risk management to these 
consolidated financial statements. If specific guidance is enacted by the IASB in 
the future, the impact may result in changes to the company financial position 
as currently presented.
d) Principles for the preparation of the consolidated 
statement of cash flows
The cash flow from operating activities of the consolidated statement of cash 
flows is based on the indirect method, the cash flow from investing and 
financing of the consolidated statement of cash flows is based on the direct 
method.
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   112

## Page 113

The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, trading activities, 
investment activities and financing activities. Receivables from and payables to 
clearing organizations are included in the cash flow from operating activities. 
The Group has elected to classify interest received and interest paid (including 
interest on lease liabilities and interest arising from revenue contracts, if there 
is any) as cash flows from operating activities. Investment activities are 
comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial 
investments other than in the course of operations, as well as acquisitions and 
sales of subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. Financing 
activities include the payment of dividend to shareholders, the (re)-purchase of 
shares, the issuance and repayment of financial debt, including financial lease 
liabilities, and capital contributions.
4. Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to 
all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
a) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group 
entities. Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and 
expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions 
with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated 
in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an 
investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through power over the investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control 
commences until the date when control ceases.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary it derecognizes the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other 
components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when 
control is lost.
Investments in associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but 
not control or joint control, over its financial and operating activities. Control or 
significant influence follows from facts and circumstances, but there is a 
rebuttable presumption that significant influence when the Group holds between 
20 percent and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are 
recognized initially at cost. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, from the 
date that significant influence commences until the date that significant 
influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an 
equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment, including 
any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the 
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group 
has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the 
date control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the 
acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a 
bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs 
are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any 
gain or loss resulting from the fair value remeasurement of contingent 
consideration is recognized in profit or loss.

b) Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of 
the respective entities of the Group at exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the 
foreign currency difference is recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising on 
the translation of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income unless 
the instrument is impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items in a foreign currency that are measured based on historical cost are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates 
at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated to euros at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, 
and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) 
of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant 
influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation 
reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of 
the gain or loss on disposal.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with 
maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Group in 
the management of its short-term commitments.
d) Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are 
originated. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and 
sales of financial assets) are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on 
which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or 
minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
▪
trading receivables, measured at fair value through profit and loss;
▪
investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;
▪
investments measured at fair value through profit and loss;
▪
financial assets held for trading at fair value through profit and loss; and
▪
other financial assets at amortized costs.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and 
loan commitments, into the following categories:
▪
trading payables, measured at fair value through profit and loss;
▪
financial liabilities held for trading at fair value through profit or loss; and
▪
other financial liabilities measured at amortised costs.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group 
acquires or incurs principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the 
near term, or holds as part of a portfolio that is managed together for short-
term profit.
Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured 
at fair value in the statement of financial position, with transaction costs 
recognised in profit or loss. All changes in fair value are recognized as part of 
net trading income in profit or loss. Trading assets and liabilities are not 
reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition.
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   114

## Page 115

Trading receivables and payables
Such assets are recognized initially at fair value with any directly attributable 
transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. 
Equity investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income ('OCI')
Equity investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
are non-derivative financial assets that the Group considers long-term 
investments of strategic relevance for the growth of the company. Equity 
investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in other 
comprehensive income as part of the change in fair value at the next 
remeasurement and they are never reclassified into profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein, other than foreign currency differences on fair value through other 
comprehensive income instruments, are recognized in other comprehensive 
income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an investment is 
derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit 
or loss.
Equity investments measured at fair value through profit and loss 
('PL')
Equity investments measured at fair value through profit and loss are non-
derivative financial assets that the group holds for long term trading purposes. 
Equity investments measured at fair value through profit and loss are 
recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in the profit 
and loss as part of the change in fair value, any re-measurement of the 
investments is classified to profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein, are recognized in profit and loss. When an investment is derecognized, 
the gain or loss is classified to profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any 
directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these 
financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method. The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange 
risk associated with its capital contributions to the United States and Singapore 
subsidiaries. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI while any gains or losses relating to 
the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. On 
disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or 
losses recorded in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of 
offset is agreed between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a 
net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under 
IFRS-EU, for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such 
as in the Group’s trading activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer 
a liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants at 
the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most 
advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value 
of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in 
an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if 
transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and 
volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition 
is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given 
or received. If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition 
differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a 
quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a 
valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the 
financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the 
difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   115


---

## Page 116

Subsequently, that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate 
basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is 
wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on theoretical prices whereby 
the price differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those 
theoretical prices can differ from quoted market prices. The Group’s Risk and 
Mid-Office department monitors whether all differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the 
Group on the basis of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are 
measured on the basis of a price that would be received to sell a net long 
position or paid to transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure. 
Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of 
the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e) Other assets Held for Trading
The Other assets Held for trading comprises the amount of digital assets that 
the group holds as a broker-trader. The group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets 
and these are measured at fair value through profit and loss. 
As a global market maker in digital assets determining the fair value and pricing 
of these assets is core to our business model. Providing our bid-ask prices to 
other market participants is impacting the principal markets. All digital assets 
positions in our Trading Book relate to very short-term holding periods and are 
based upon our business model in which trading positions are economically 
hedged. For the determination of the fair value, the group constantly collects 
reference prices from multiple crypto exchanges and active markets for the 
mark-to-market treatment. If assets are not actively traded the valuation is 
based upon quoted prices or observable inputs from similar assets per crypto 
exchange.  Given the IFRS 13 requirements and our current pricing & fair value 
models used for the valuation of our other assets-held-for-trading and other 
liabilities-for-trading these are recognized as Level 2 Fair Values.
f) Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, 
they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and 
equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated 
as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying 
amount of the item) is recognized in profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
Ongoing repairs and maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in 
profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of each component. 
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant 
items of property and equipment are as follows:
▪
hardware: 5 years;
▪
office fixtures: 5 years;
▪
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. 
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the 
lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of 
right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized less any 
lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on 
a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   116


---

## Page 117

term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Right-of-use assets are 
recorded in property and equipment and intangible assets on the statement of 
financial position.
g) Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the 
estimated useful lives of each component. The estimated useful life of 
significant intangible assets is 5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognized and in subsequent years measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of equity-accounted investees is included in the carrying 
amount of the investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying 
amount of the equity-accounted investee as a whole.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
h) Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and 
other debt financial assets not held at fair value through profit and loss, 
together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, in this 
section all referred to as ‘financial instruments’, is based on the credit losses 
expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or 
LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since 
origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected 
credit loss (12mECL). 
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by 
comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. 
An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there has 
been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount.
For other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating 
ECLs as these receivables relate to operating activities of the Group. Therefore, 
the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has 
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss 
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment. 
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 
90 days past due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a 
financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicated 
that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full 
before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A 
financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovering the contractual cash flows.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred 
tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized if the 
carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and 
its fair value less cost of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates 
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, 
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at 
which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which 
goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses 
recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   117


---

## Page 118

of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the 
carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata 
basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
i) Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under 
short-term cash variable compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
j) Share based payments
The fair value of equity-settled transactions granted to employees is determined 
by the fair value of the shares at the date when the grant is made. When 
employees render services as consideration for equity instruments, the expense 
is recognized in employee expenses, together with a corresponding increase in 
equity (retained earnings), over the period in which the service conditions are 
fulfilled (the vesting period). The awards vest in tranches on various dates over 
a total period of three to five years. Graded vesting is applied where needed. 
Vesting is conditional upon the employee being actively employed by the Group 
on the vesting date. If the employee is terminated or resigns, any unvested 
tranches of the award will be forfeited. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The 
expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the 
movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of 
that period. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into 
account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood 
of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance 
conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions 
attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are 
considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in 
the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award 
unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is 
recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards 
include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as 
vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
The fair value of share appreciation rights (SARs) granted to employees, which 
are cash-settled, is recognized in employee expenses, together with a 
corresponding increase in other liabilities, over the period during which the 
service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The liability is remeasured at 
the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes 
in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Estimates used are reassessed at the 
end of each reporting period.
k) Other liabilities Held for Trading 
As part of its trading activities, the Company enters into digital asset payables. 
The borrowed digital assets payables are measured at fair value through profit 
or loss.
l) Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
recognized as finance cost. 
m)
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities 
on the statement of financial position measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present value of 
lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date. After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the 
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   118


---

## Page 119

remeasured if there is a change in the lease term or in case of other 
reassessments or modifications. 
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term 
leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on 
short-term leases are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
n) Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial 
expenses related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity 
and are therefore directly recognized in the profit and loss account under 
trading income.
o) Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax 
are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to a business 
combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive 
income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or 
loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of 
previous years. Current tax payable also includes any withholding tax liability 
arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
their tax bases. Deferred tax is not recognized for:
▪
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
▪
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in 
the foreseeable future; and
▪
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to 
temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into 
account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and 
interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are 
adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, 
including interpretations of tax law and management judgement. This 
assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause 
the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax 
liabilities or the collectability of tax assets. Such changes will impact tax 
expense in the period that such a change in estimate is made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the 
same tax authority on the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis or the tax assets and liabilities will be 
realized simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and 
deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
p) Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
recognized at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in 
profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own 
equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the 
consideration, if reissued, is recognized in the share premium.
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   119


---

## Page 120

q) Non-current assets held for sale
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if 
their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups 
classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly 
attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs 
and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale 
is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or 
that the decision to sale will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to 
the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year 
from the date of the classification. Assets and liabilities classified as held for 
sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial 
position.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an 
entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and is 
part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business 
or geographical area of operations.
5. Operating segments
The management board examines the group performance from a regional 
perspective and has identified three reportable segments of its global trading 
business: Europe, the Americas and Asia.
Europe consists of the activities in the Netherlands with branches for 
institutional trading in France, UK, Italy, trading activities in Jersey and IT 
activities in Romania. Americas consists of the subsidiaries in the USA. Asia 
contains our subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore. Hong Kong has a 
Chinese representative office in Shanghai. The management board considers 
this segmentation to be relevant to understand the group financial performance 
because it allows investors to understand the primary method used by 
management to evaluate the operating performance and decision making about 
allocation of resources and trading capital. The group measures results on IFRS 
basis and reconciles the total segment results on net trading income, profit 
before tax and net profit. Significant transactions and balances between 
geographic regions occur primarily as result of group operating companies 
incurring the operating expenses such as employee compensation, 
communication, software development and data processing and overhead costs 
for the purpose of providing services to affiliated operating companies (line 
items intercompany recharge income and expenses).
The Group’s trading assets and liabilities attributable to each segment are 
reported to management on the basis of net liquidity. Consequently, the 
reported total assets in each segment are net of the segment’s financial 
liabilities held for trading, trading payables and other liabilities held for trading. 
The Group’s capital expenditures include additions to property, equipment and 
intangible assets as set out in notes 23 and 24.

6. New standards and interpretations
All accounting policies are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2021 except the 
presentation of the treasury shares reserve in the balance sheet and in the 
changes in equity.
Material accounting policy information
In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice 
Statement 2. The amendments to IAS 1 require companies to disclose their 
material accounting policy information rather than their significant accounting 
policies. The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance on 
how to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures. The 
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2023. The Group does not anticipate that the application of these amendments 
will have an effect on the future consolidated financial statements. 
7. Changes in presentation
Accounting for treasury shares
IFRS does not mandate a specific method of presenting treasury shares within 
Shareholders Equity. Until 2021 Flow Traders reported the treasury shares 
reserve within the Shareholders Premium Account. As from 2022 in order to 
provide more relevant information about the transactions in treasury shares and 
the group financial position we adjusted our disclosures by having a separate 
line item treasury shares reserve in the balance sheet and a separate column in 
the consolidated statement of change in equity. As a result the comparative 
numbers for 2021 were restated for presentation purposes.
Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2022, 
but do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group.
8. Fair values of financial instruments and other assets and 
liabilities held for trading
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes 
based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the 
assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to 
that asset or liability.
Valuation models 
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement 
that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer 
the liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants 
at the measurement date. 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, 
depending on the inputs used for making the measurements.
▪
Level 1: fair value of financial instruments based upon inputs that are 
quoted, unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical 
instruments;
▪
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from 
prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market 
prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical 
or similar instruments in markets that are not considered active; or other 
valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly 
observable from market data;
▪
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments 
for which the valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a 
significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes 
instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments 
but for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are 
required to reflect differences between the instruments, for example unlisted 
equity securities.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in 
active markets are based on prices obtained directly from an exchange on which 
the instruments are traded or obtained from a broker that provides an 
unadjusted quoted price from an active market for identical instruments. For all 
other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other 
valuation techniques.
The Group uses widely recognized valuation techniques and models for 
determining the fair value of common, simple financial instruments that use 
only observable market data and require little management judgement and 
estimation. Observable prices or model inputs used in valuation techniques 
include risk-free and benchmark interest rates and credit spreads used in 
estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   123

## Page 124

rates, equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilizes and 
correlations, which are usually available in the market for listed debt and equity 
securities, exchange-traded derivatives and simple over-the-counter 
derivatives. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces 
the need for management judgement and estimation and thus reduces the 
uncertainty associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable 
market prices and inputs varies depending on the products and markets and is 
prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the 
financial markets.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities 
on the basis of net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in 
determining appropriate portfolio-level adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. 
Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask spreads for similar 
instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. 
Similarly, when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial 
liabilities on the basis of net exposure to the credit risk of a particular 
counterparty, it takes into account any existing arrangements that mitigate the 
credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty).
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the 
measurement of fair values. This framework involves both the Risk and 
Operations department which are independent of the Trading department and 
report directly to the CRO who is a member of the Management Board. The Risk 
and Operations department have overall responsibility for independently 
verifying the results of trading and all significant fair value measurements. The 
daily reconciliation of the positions and prices between the prime brokers and 
the Trading department is most important.
a. Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The valuation of trading positions, both the long and the short positions, is 
determined by reference to last traded prices from identical instruments from 
the exchanges at the reporting date. Such financial assets and liabilities are 
classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are 
carried at fair value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted 
market prices. The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused 
by the fact that the Group continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities 
based on all available information. This includes prices for identical and near-
identical positions, as well as the prices for securities underlying the Group’s 
positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on which the 
financial asset or liability is primarily traded closes. The Group’s Risk and 
Operations department checks the theoretical price independently. As part of 
their review, they monitor whether all price adjustments can be substantiated 
with market inputs. Consequently, such financial assets and liabilities are 
classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to 
determine fair value. 
b. Trading receivables and payables
Trading receivables and payables are measured on a fair value basis and 
designated at fair value though profit and loss. In accordance with the Group 
Accounting Policy of trade-date accounting for regular-way sale and purchase 
transactions, sales/purchase transactions awaiting settlement represent 
amounts receivable/payable for securities sold/purchased but not yet settled as 
at the reporting date. Receivables from and payables to broker-dealers, 
including cash balances held at the Group’s clearing firms and the net amount 
receivable or payable for securities transactions pending settlement are included 
in this category. The group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime 
brokers to facilitate its trading activities to finance the purchase and settlement 
of financial instruments. These Financial liabilities are included at amortized 
cost. Gains, and losses, including on derecognition, interest expense and foreign 
exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss.
c. Investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income ('OCI')
The fair value of Investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income is determined by reference to their quoted closing bid 
price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation 
technique and are classified as Level 2 or level 3, conditional upon the regular 
availability of quoted closing bid prices.
d. Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss
The fair value of Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss is 
determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   124

or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique and are classified as 
Level 3.
e. Other assets held for trading 
The Other assets Held for trading comprises the amount of digital assets that 
the group holds as a broker-dealer. The group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets 
and these are measured at fair value through profit and loss, as the company 
uses its own fair value models based on quoted prices or observable inputs for 
the valuation of the digit assets, these assets are classified as Level 2.
f. Other liabilities held for trading
From time to time, the Company borrows digital assets as part of its trading 
strategy. The borrowed digital assets payables are measured at Fair Value 
through profit or loss as the company uses its own fair value models based on 
quoted prices or observable inputs for the valuation of the borrowed digital 
assets, these liabilities are classified as level 2 and level 3.
g. Fair Value hierarchy 
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial 
assets and liabilities according to their fair value hierarchy.

Hedge of net investments in foreign operations 
Included in financial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2022 was a 
borrowing of USD 19.9 million (2021: USD 37.0 million) which has been 
designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States and 
Singapore subsidiaries, which have their functional currencies in USD. This 
borrowing is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign 
exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this 
borrowing are transferred to other comprehensive income to offset any gains or 
losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the 
foreign exchange risk on the USD borrowing. The Group has established a 
hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical 
to the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the 
amount of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the 
amount of the borrowing.  The hedging gain recognized in other comprehensive 
income before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for measuring 
effectiveness. There is no ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss.
The impact of the hedging instrument recorded in financial liabilities held for 
trading on the statement of financial position is as follows:

The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on profit for the year 
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the number of ordinary shares 
outstanding. 
The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted 
average effect of changes in treasury shares during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the basic earnings per 
share for the effects of all dilutive share-based payments to employees.

The wages and salaries of the Group increased in line with the FTE development 
from 613 as per 31 December 2021 to 660 as per 31 December 2022. Overall 
employee expenses increased by 13% as a result of the overall increase in 
variable compensation and wages and salaries paid to employees. The decrease 
in variable compensation is also reflected in the decrease in other liabilities. The 
amount of variable compensation payable is based on the operational profit of 
the company. 
The amounts recognized in profit and loss during 2022 do not fully reconcile 
with the remuneration report due to the deferred recognition of expenses in 
future years due to the service condition element of the employee share plans.
Share-based payments
The company awards its employees with shares based on their loyalty, as part 
of their sign-on package or as part of their variable compensation. The shares 
awarded under the loyalty and sign-on package share plans are awarded based 
on a net basis, which entails that the company is liable for the employee income 
tax due for these plans. Shares awards as part of the variable compensation are 
gross awards, which entails that the employee income tax obligations are to be 
paid out of these awards. 
In either case the Group is responsible for withholding wage taxes upon vesting 
in the Netherlands and in most other countries of operations. The estimated 
amount of wage taxes can be up to 50% in the Netherlands, for which future 
cash outflows are covered by the selling of part of the Treasury Shares kept in 
the Share Premium Account.

vest over a period of one to five years, depending on the share plan and 
agreement with the employee, subject to the condition that the employee 
remains employed on the vesting date.
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date. Throughout 
2022 the company  awarded employees shares based on a fixed monetary value 
of €2.0 million (2021:€0.6 million), reflecting a weighted  average fair value of 
shares granted of €26.80 (2021: €32.51). The exercise price of the share option 
is equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The 
expense recognized during the year was €2.1 million (2021: €2.3 million).

Under the variable remuneration share plans, shares are granted to employees 
as part of their variable compensation. The shares vest in four equal 
instalments during the first quarter of the subsequent year over a period of four 
years subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on the 
vesting date.
The fair value of the shares granted to employees as part of the 2022 variable 
remuneration is estimated at grant date at €27.4 million. Employees are 
granted shares based on a fixed monetary value. The final number of shares will 
be determined based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the first

c) Share appreciation rights
Certain employees are awarded share appreciation rights (SARs) as part of their 
variable compensation, settled in cash. The SARs vest in equal instalments over 
a period of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The liability for the SARs is measured, initially 
and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the 
SARs. The carrying amount of the liability relating to the SARs at 31 December 
2022 was €10.4 million (2021: €10.4 million). The expense recognized during 
the year was €3.6 million (2021: €9.6 million).

Payables for securities bought
In accordance with the Group’s policy of trade date accounting for regular way 
sale and purchase transactions, payables for securities bought represent 
amounts payables for securities that were purchased, but not yet settled as at 
the reporting date. The amount payable is based on the net unsettled amount 
per clearing institution.
Borrowings
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to 
facilitate the trading activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of 
financial instruments). The drawn amounts on these facilities continuously 
fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given moment.
The Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities with ABN AMRO Clearing 
Bank N.V. (AACB), totalling €2,825 million per year end, comprising of a EUR 
denominated facility of €2,350 million and a USD denominated facility of $540 
million. In addition, the Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities for 
portfolio margin financing with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BA ML), Goldman 
Sachs, Barclays Bank, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank. These facilities can be modified or 
terminated at any time. The facilities are exclusively for the financing of 
positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary course of the 
trading activities using the various prime brokers.
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin 
requirements (representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is 
variable and calculated on a daily basis depending on portfolio size and 
composition) in cash or securities as security for our positions held with the 
relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities, the Group is required 
to comply with a net liquidation balance that exceeds the haircut calculated by 
the prime broker. Both the net liquidation balance and haircut are variable and 
calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio size and composition. The 
main covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to loan size (variable and 
calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio composition). In addition, for 
our Asian operations they require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%, 
calculated by shareholders equity divided by credit limit.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with 
financial statements and other information, including information on our trading 
activities and trading counterparties, and permission to inspect our books and 
records. Furthermore, they require us to maintain all relevant authorizations 
and memberships required in order to conduct our business, and comply with all 
applicable laws, rules and regulations and place restrictions on mergers and 
disposition of our assets outside the ordinary course of our business.

Fiscal unity
The Group constitutes a fiscal unity with most of its fully owned Dutch resident 
subsidiaries for Dutch corporate income tax purposes. Moreover, Flow Traders 
B.V. forms part of a fiscal unity for VAT purposes, covering most of the Dutch 
Group. All companies in the fiscal unity are jointly and severally liable for the 
tax obligations of the fiscal unity.
Cash incentive provided to employees
Up until and including 2019, employees had the possibility to participate in an 
employee incentive plan and are eligible to a cash incentive depending on their 
share position in the company. One of the conditions for this cash incentive is 
that the employee needs to be employed at the company at time of the 
payment of the cash incentive. Payments will be made in the first, second, 
third, fourth and fifth year of the plan. Based on IAS 19, costs related to the 
cash incentive may not be recognized until the employee fulfils the service 
obligation. Therefore these costs will be recognized in future years in profit and 
loss. In 2022 the company recognized €1.8 million of costs relating to this plan 
(2021: €2.3 million). 
As from 2020 certain employees receive part of their variable compensation in 
share appreciation rights (SARs). The SARs vest in equal instalments over a 
period of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The SARS are expenses and recognized in the 
financial statements in line with the IFRS 2 Share based payment - cash settled 
accounting rules (refer also to note 12 - Employee Expenses).

Flow Traders Foundation
As some of Flow Traders’ Supervisory Board members sit on the board of the 
Flow Traders Foundation (“Foundation”), the foundation is considered a related 
party. 
In 2020 Flow Traders established the Flow Traders Foundation, a Charity or 
Foundation (“Stichting”) to better structure its historic engagement in giving to 
others in society who need (financial) help. During 2020 Flow Traders has put in 
place the funding to make sure that a significant financial basis has been laid so 
that the Foundation has the financial means to make not only an annual but 
also a structural impact and meets its purpose.
In 2022 Flow Traders contributed a total value of €0.5 million (2021: €0.6 
million) related to the Multiyear right to appoint charities the Foundation 
supports as the main shirt sponsor of a Dutch professional football club and 
donated €0.4 million of the 2021 cash bonus reserved for employees to the 
Foundation. For 2022, €0.5 million of the 2022 variable remuneration pool for 
employees was reserved for donation in 2023 (2021: €0.4 million).  
In addition, as part of donation agreements between some of the Supervisory 
Board members with the Foundation, the Foundation is obligated to invest the 
donations received from these members into shares of the Group. In 2022 the 
Foundation received a donation of €0.5 million from certain Supervisory Board 
members, which it used to purchase 16,626 shares in Flow Traders N.V. against 
a share price of €30.07.

Financial risk management
Overview
The Group is exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
▪
Operational risk
▪
Credit risk;
▪
Market risk;
▪
Foreign Exchange risk;
▪
Interest Rate risk;
▪
Liquidity risk;
▪
Concentration risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and 
managing risk, and the Group’s management of our liquidity and capital.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Our Group Operational Risk framework contributes to raise awareness of these 
risks to all our employees and promotes a risk mitigation culture in all our 
processes. This includes documenting of procedures and periodically updating of 
this documentation. 
The risk governance and independence of the Risk team ensures that our risk 
appetite is appropriately implemented, monitored and reported to Management 
on a regular basis. We maintain an internal operational risk event database that 
captures any incident that may have occurred (irrespective if it led to a financial 
loss/profit or not). We routinely perform an in-depth analysis of these incidents 
in order to avoid a reoccurrence. 
Every year, we conduct Risk Control Self Assessments (RCSA) across the 
organisation to update what our main inherent risks are and which could be the 
most impactful in order to manage them to be within our risk appetite. 
Any breach of risk appetite is escalated to Management. A decision is then 
made as to whether we should mitigate, defer or accept the breach. If 
mitigation is considered to be the appropriate action, a Taskforce is put in place 
to bring back the residual risk scoring within our risk appetite. This ongoing 
vigilance ensures we dedicate the appropriate amount of time and resources to 
improve our control environment in a consistent and risk-based manner.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a 
financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise 
from the settlement of off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is 
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of 
financial position. These amounts significantly exceed expected loss in the event 
of counterparty default, as expected loss takes into account the likelihood of 
such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of counterparty default is 
deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the 
central counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date was as follows:

Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are 
guaranteed by the central counterparty or clearing house related to that 
exchange. Members of these clearing houses are required to deposit substantial 
amounts of cash, bonds or equities as collateral for any failure to settlement of 
trading. While still a limited part of our business, there is an inherent risk 
related to transactions on digital assets exchanges as they are generally 
unregulated. This risk is mitigated by strict onboarding procedures and limiting 
the value traded on exchange to minimize the maximum risk.
The Group manages credit risk through its Risk department that provide specific 
guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit 
risk.
Policies include amongst others:
▪
limits for individual product types;
▪
limits per counterparty;
▪
limits on the duration of the exposure;
▪
limits for settlement types;
▪
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
▪
limits to exchanges
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty 
exposures are monitored on an intra-day basis.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial 
liabilities that:
▪
are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
▪
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar 
agreement that covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether 
they are offset in the statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master 
repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. 
Similar financial instruments include derivatives, sales and repurchase 
agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and 
securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, such as loans and 
deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for 
offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because they create a 
right to offset recognized amounts for the parties to the agreement that is 
enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the 
Group or the counterparties or following other predetermined events.
In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net 
basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can 
receive and grant collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in 
respect of the following transactions:
▪
derivatives;
▪
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
▪
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable 
securities as set out in notes 17 and 26 in respect of derivatives (including 
swaps). Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms including, where 
appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities 
received/granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the 
transaction, but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   145


---

## Page 146

also give each party the right to terminate the related transactions on the 
counterparty’s failure to post collateral.
Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to 
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include: 
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and 
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar 
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set-off liabilities against 
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event 
of the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or 
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount

Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial 
instrument fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited 
to, interest rates, volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and 
equity prices. The Risk department monitors market risk exposure on a 
continuous intraday basis. Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated 
risk for the Group, limit breaches will trigger action from the Risk department in 
order to reduce the risk back to within our preset limits.
In addition to the Group’s Risk department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily by Operations. The applicable haircut and margins are 
computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The Risk department computes the 
haircut using internal models enabling intraday monitoring. Limits are set on 
both capital- and credit usage. Long and short trading positions include 
securities and derivatives such as: shares, American depositary receipts (ADR 
s), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRA s), exchange-
traded products (ETP) and digital assets. All traded financial instruments are 
liquid instruments. Therefore, our portfolio can always be liquidated within a 
short time frame and with a limited cost impact.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimise its risk for adverse 
price movements and does not engage in long or short only positions. The 
direction of market movements, i.e. what the Group considers directional 
market risk taking, is not relevant for the Group because of our market-making 
trading strategy. Due to the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is 
close to zero. Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency 
risk and settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading 
are captured in the risk and margin requirements which the Group is required to 
post at its prime brokers and clearing firms. The consolidated margin and 
haircut requirements over 2022 are shown in the Capital management 
paragraph. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk close to 
zero remains as a result of inefficiencies in the models of the prime brokers.
Market risk factors relating to digital assets and liabilities
In a similar matter to traditional assets, the price of a digital asset or liability 
fluctuates according to its supply and demand. We manage this risk by holding 
digital assets in the same proportion as liabilities (long/short delta neutral 
book). Per year end we had a total exposure to digital assets of € 0.1 million 
(2021 € 0.4 million).
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions 
denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the 
Group entities, primarily the Euro, as well as United States dollars and 
Singapore dollars.
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as 
well as net results of these foreign operations during the year. The Group 
manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by 
currency. Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in 
currencies other than the functional currency. The Group does use financial 
instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net investments in foreign 
operations or net results of foreign operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial 
instruments. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of 
mismatches of arranged interest rates of assets and liabilities. The Group has 
limits in place on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These limits ensure 
that interest rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and 
hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained within 
established limits. All financial instruments are held for trading purposes and 
are accounted for at fair value on the balance sheet. All positions carried on the 
balance sheet are short term and listed on exchanges and therefore liquid and 
tradable.
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility 
available to facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the balance sheet. 
In order to match the liquidity and short holding period of these trading 
positions, the facility has an interest rate payable, which is floating. The Group 
runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact that the interest is 
also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short positions and in 
the EFP of the future.
Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well 
as the Group’s investments in investments measured at fair value through other 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   149

comprehensive income or through profit and loss. In addition, for its option 
positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk 
factor. Other factors to consider are time and dividend expectations.
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual 
positions per product and aggregate position per trading desk  relating to the 
size of the exposure, concentrations, pricing and valuation parameters and 
natural hedging between these long and short positions. As the Group is active 
in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in underlying 
values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and 
margins are computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis 
measures all positions, individual and correlated, and reflects the different risk 
components. The third-party haircut calculation confirms the internal 
assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is exposed 
to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is 
presented under the earlier "Market risk" section.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the 
obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering 
cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to 
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without 
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The 
Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime 
brokers, is monitored on a daily basis.

Concentration Risk
Concentration risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in 
similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have 
similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual 
obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other 
conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s 
performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic 
location. The Group’s policies and procedures and the broad geographic and 
industry spread of its activities limit its exposure to any concentration risk. 
Additionally management has established credit limits for geographic and 
counterparty exposures, which are monitored on a daily basis. We monitor the 
distribution of assets and off-balance sheet items by geographic region and 
industry sector on an ongoing basis.

Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the 
prime brokers through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well 
as cash generated from our operating activities. As of 31 December 2022, the 
Group held €8.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to €4.9 million 
as of 31 December 2021. These balances are maintained primarily to support 
operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient short-term 
access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.
The Group maintains a highly liquid balance sheet, with a large portion of its 
total assets consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable securities and short-
term trading receivables (arising from securities transactions).
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intra-day basis and maintains 
significant portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to 
facilitate trading. These facilities are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as 
well as all financial assets in accounts held at the respective prime brokers. The 
Group has no outstanding borrowings other than the portfolio financing facilities 
with prime brokers.
Capital management
Objectives and processes of managing capital
The Company’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base well above the 
required margin in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. The management board 
monitors the regulatory capital and prime broker margin requirements ratio’s 
consolidated and for its key regions, the return on its capital as well as the level 
of dividend to its shareholders. The process of allocation capital to different 
regions and activities is subject to review to the Risk Committee. 
Regulatory Capital
Capital adequacy and the use of required regulatory capital are based on the 
guidelines developed by Investment Firm Regulation and Investment Firm EU 
Directives (IFR/IFD). The Group’s lead regulator, the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), 
sets and monitors capital requirements for the group as a whole and for the 
operating company Flow Traders B.V.. In addition, the activities of our 
subsidiaries in the USA and APAC are supervised by their local regulators. 
The DNB adopted the IFR/IFD capital requirements as from June 26, 2021. As 
part of the IFR/IFD Capital Requirements Flow Traders N.V. is categorized as 
Category II Investment Firm and applying K-factor risk model, fixed overhead 
costs and minimum capital requirements as the Pillar I requirements. The DNB 
on top of Pillar I has set additional Pillar II capital requirements. 
The group and its individually regulated subsidiaries have complied with all 
externally imposed capital requirements.

Subsequent events
On 13 January 2023, the group completed the update to its corporate holding 
structure. This followed receipt of shareholder approval at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting held on 2 December 2022 and fulfilment of all regulatory and 
other customary closing conditions. As a result of the update, the group’s top 
holding company is now Flow Traders Ltd, The update of the corporate holding 
structure enables Flow Traders to become more competitive as a global liquidity 
provider, particularly in relation to regulatory capital management. Different 
capital requirements will apply following the update of the holding structure 
which are expected to expand Flow Traders' strategic growth options. 
Furthermore, it will create a more level playing field with global peers with 
respect to the regulatory capital framework. Flow Traders’ regulated entities will 
continue to be subject to supervision by their respective regulators, however 
Flow Traders will no longer be subject to consolidated supervision. Flow Traders 
has obtained an unconditional declaration of no objection from the Dutch 
Central Bank (DNB) in connection with the update of the corporate holding 
structure.

## Page 154

As part of the change of its corporate holding structure Flow Traders N.V. 
entered into a cross-border legal merger in which (i) all Flow Traders N.V.'s 
assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and other legal relationships were acquired 
by Flow Traders S.A. incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, (ii) Flow 
Traders N.V. ceased to exist and (iii) each Shareholder received one Flow 
Traders S.A. share for each Flow Traders N.V. Share. Following this merger Flow 
Traders S.A. converted into a Bermuda Limited company and changed its 
registered address to Bermuda. 
As Flow Traders N.V. and Flow Traders S.A. are under common control at the 
time they entered into the cross-border legal merger, IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations is not applicable. A predecessor value method is instead used to 
determine the carrying value of all assets and liabilities that transfer as part of 
the merger. As at the 13th of January 2023 the assets and liabilities of  Flow 
Traders N.V. are consolidated in the financial statements of Flow Traders S.A. at 
their carrying amount on this date, in accordance with the predecessor value 
method.
Following the completion of the update our corporate holding structure on 13 
January 2023, group consolidated capital requirements are no longer applicable. 
Accordingly, CET1 and the Own Funds Requirement will no longer exist at the 
group level. Our regulated subsidiaries will continue to hold regulatory capital as 
required by their respective individual regulators. This will be reflected in the 
regulatory capital reporting going forward.
Flow Traders Limited (referred to as the “Company”) is an exempted company 
limited by shares registered under the Company Act 1981 of Bermuda, as 
amended (the “Companies Act”). Flow Traders Ltd was incorporated on 13 
January 2023 with its registered office at Canon's Court, 22 Victoria Street, PO 
Box HM 179 , Hamilton HM EX Bermuda. The principal place of business for the 
Company is located at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 1018 LL Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands. Flow Traders Ltd is registered with the Dutch Trade Register of the 
Chamber of Commerce under number 88926257 as a company formally 
registered abroad (“formeel buitenlandse kapitaalvennootschap”) as this term is 
referred to in the Dutch Companies Formally Registered Abroad  Act (“Wet op 
de formeel buitenlandse vennootschappen”), which means we are deemed a 
Dutch resident company for corporate reporting purposes in accordance with 
applicable Dutch laws.

Notes to the parent company financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and 
the determination of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and 
liabilities and determination of the result for its parent Company financial 
statements, the Group applies the option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the 
Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the recognition and measurement of 
assets and liabilities and determination of the result (hereinafter referred to as 
principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent company financial 
statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS -EU financial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has significant 
influence, are measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated 
statements chapter 1 to 4 for a description of the Group’s IFRS -EU principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Company’s share in the 
results of these participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the 
transfer of assets and liabilities between (i) the Group and its participating 
interests on (ii) between participating interests themselves, are not recognized.
Restatement of prior period error
For the 31 December 2021 company balance sheet we presented an amount of 
€33.8 million in relation to the the intercompany receivable of the treasury 
shares towards group entities as both a receivable from group companies as well 
as company shareholders equity of Flow Traders N.V.. In addition a gain on the 
intercompany receivable of €0.7 million was reported in the profit and loss. For 
the consolidated financial statements the amount of treasury shares are deducted 
from shareholders equity. Transactions and/or balance sheet positions between 
the parent company and its consolidated participation in which there is a 100% 
interest do not lead to differences between the equity according to the separate 
financial statements and the equity according to the consolidated financial 
statements. The effects of intragroup transactions and/or balance sheet positions 
are eliminated, with the eliminations applied in the consolidated financial 
statements being the starting point for the eliminations in the separate financial 
statements. Considering this  €33.8 million was eliminated in the company 
balance sheet from both the receivables from group companies and the equity 
share premium account as per 31 December 2021. In addition the gain of €0.7 
million on the intercompany receivable was eliminated.

Other contingent liabilities
Fiscal unity
The parent Company forms part of the Group fiscal unity for corporate income 
tax purposes. All companies in the fiscal unity are jointly and severally liable for 
the tax obligations of the fiscal unity. The parent Company’s tax assets or 
liabilities face the tax authorities on behalf of the fiscal unity. 
Cash incentive provided to employees
As from 2020 certain employees receive part of their variable compensation in 
share appreciation rights (SARs). The SARs vest in equal instalments over a 
period of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The SARS are expenses and recognized in the 
financial statements in line with the IFRS 2 Share based payment - cash settled 
accounting rules (refer also to note 12 - Employee Expenses).

Provisions in the Articles of 
Association governing the 
appropriation of profit:
The provisions in the Byelaws governing the 
appropriation of profit read as follows: 
Dividends and other payments 
1. Dividends and Distributions. Subject to these 
Bye-laws, the Board may from time to time 
declare dividends or distributions out of 
contributed surplus to be paid to the 
Shareholders according to their rights and 
interests, including such interim dividends as 
appear to the Board to be justified by the 
position of the Company. The Board, in its 
discretion, may determine that any dividend shall 
be paid in cash or shall be satisfied, subject to 
Bye -Laws 5.2, 35.1 and 35.2, in paying up in full 
shares in the Company to be issued to the 
Shareholders credited as fully paid or partly paid 
or partly in one way and partly the other. The 
Board may also pay any fixed cash dividend 
which is payable on any shares of the Company 
half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the 
Board, justifies such payment. In making any 
determination regarding the declaration of a 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, the Board must, in addition to any other 
obligations or duties under the Companies Acts 
or these Bye-Laws, consider the Stakeholder 
Interests. 
2. Implementation. Except insofar as the rights 
attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share 
otherwise provide: (a) all dividends or 
distributions out of contributed surplus may be 
declared and paid according to the amounts paid 
up on the shares in respect of which the dividend 
or distribution is paid, and an amount paid up on 
a share in advance of calls may be treated for the 
purpose of this Bye-Law as paid-up on the share; 
(b) dividends or distributions out of contributed 
surplus may be apportioned and paid pro rata 
according to the amounts paid-up on the shares 
during any portion or portions of the period in 
respect of which the dividend or distribution is 
paid. 
3. Deductions. The Board may deduct from any 
dividend, distribution or other monies payable to 
a Shareholder by the Company on or in respect 
of any shares all sums of money (if any) 
presently payable by him to the Company on 
account of calls or otherwise in respect of shares 
of the Company. 
4. No Interest. No dividend, distribution or other 
monies payable by the Company on or in respect 
of any share shall bear interest against the 
Company. 
5. Method of Payment. (a) Subject to Bye-Law 
33.5(b), any dividend, distribution or interest, or 
part thereof payable in cash, or any other sum 
payable in cash to the holder of shares may be 
paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post 
or by courier addressed to the holder at their 
address in the Register or, in the case of joint 
holders, addressed to the holder whose name 
stands first in the Register in respect of the 
shares at their registered address as appearing in 
the Register or addressed to such person at such 
address as the holder or joint holders may in 
writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant 
shall, unless the holder or joint holders otherwise 
direct, be made payable to the order of the 
holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the 
order of the holder whose name stands first in 
the Register in respect of such shares, and shall 
be sent at their or their risk and payment of the 
cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is 
drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the 
Company. Any one of two (2) or more joint 
holders may give effectual receipts for any 
dividends, distributions or other monies payable 
or property distributable in respect of the shares 
held by such joint holders. (b) All dividends, 
distributions or interests in respect of shares held 
by a securities depositary, including Euroclear 
Nederland, shall be paid by placing those 
dividends, distributions or interest at the disposal 
of such securities depositary, subject to and in 
accordance with the regulations of such securities 
depositary. 
6. Unclaimed Amounts. Any dividend or distribution 
out of contributed surplus unclaimed for a period 
of five (5) years from the date of declaration of 
such dividend or distribution shall be forfeited 
and shall revert to the Company and the 
payment by the Board of any unclaimed 
dividend, distribution, interest or other sum 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2022   165


---

## Page 166

payable on or in respect of the share into a 
separate account shall not constitute the 
Company a trustee in respect thereof. 
7. In-Kind Satisfaction. The Board may also, in 
addition to its other powers, direct payment or 
satisfaction of any dividend or distribution out of 
contributed surplus wholly or in part by the 
distribution of specific assets, and in particular of 
paid-up shares or debentures of any other 
company, and where any difficulty arises in 
regard to such distribution or dividend, the Board 
may settle it as it thinks expedient, and in 
particular, may authorise any person to sell and 
transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions 
altogether, and may fix the value for distribution 
or dividend purposes of any such specific assets 
and may determine that cash payments shall be 
made to any Shareholders upon the footing of 
the values so fixed in order to secure equality of 
distribution and may vest any such specific 
assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the 
Board, provided that such dividend or distribution 
may not be satisfied by the distribution of any 
partly paid shares or debentures of any company 
without the sanction of a Resolution.
Reserves
8. Reserves. The Board may before declaring any 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, set aside such sums as it thinks proper 
as reserves which shall, at the discretion of the 
Board, be applicable for any purpose of the 
Company and pending such application may, also 
at such discretion, either be employed in the 
business of the Company or be invested in such 
investments as the Board may from time to time 
think fit. The Board may also without placing the 
same to reserve carry forward any sums which it 
may think it prudent not to distribute. 
Capitalisation of profits
9. Capitalisation. The Board may from time to time 
resolve to capitalise all or any part of any amount 
for the time being standing to the credit of any 
reserve or fund which is available for distribution 
or to the credit of any share premium account 
and accordingly that such amount be set free for 
distribution amongst the Shareholders or any 
class of Shareholders who would be entitled 
thereto if distributed by way of dividend and in 
the same proportions, on the footing that the 
same be not paid in cash but be applied either in 
or towards paying up amounts for the time being 
unpaid on any shares in the Company held by 
such Shareholders respectively or in payment up 
in full of unissued shares, debentures or other 
obligations of the Company, to be allotted and 
distributed credited as fully paid amongst such 
Shareholders, or partly in one way and partly in 
the other, provided that for the purpose of this 
ByeLaw, a share premium account may be 
applied only in paying up of unissued shares to 
be issued to such Shareholders credited as fully 
paid.

Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders Ltd as successor of Flow Traders N.V. in 
accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory 
audit of public-interest entities, the “Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties” (Wta, 
Audit firms supervision act), the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van 
accountants bij assurance-opdrachten” (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant 
independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with 
the “Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch Code of 
Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. 
Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following 
information in support of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this 
context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these 
matters.
Our understanding of the business
Flow Traders is a global financial technology-enabled multi-asset class liquidity 
provider with its core business in Exchange Traded Products, which includes fixed 
income, currencies, digital assets and commodities. Flow Traders N.V.  is 
structured in components and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. 
We paid specific attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by the nature 
of the group and our risk assessment. 
We determined materiality and identified and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order 
to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Materiality
Materiality
€ 8 million (2021: €7.3 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of profit before tax (rounded)
Explanation
We applied profit before tax as this 
benchmark is an important metric for the 
users of the consolidated financial statements. 
We determined materiality consistently with 
the previous financial year.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements 
that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for 
qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the audit committee of the Board (hereinafter: the Audit 
Committee) that misstatements in excess of € 0,4 million, which are identified 
during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this 
group is included in the consolidated financial statements.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for 
directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have 
determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for 
group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities 
or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or 
review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or 
specific items.
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities, Flow Traders N.V. 
(parent company), Flow Traders B.V. and Flow Traders U.S. LLC, based on the 
relative financial size of and risks related to these components. We have: 
▪
Performed audit procedures ourselves at group entities Flow Traders N.V., and 
Flow Traders B.V. 
▪
Used the work of another (non-EY) auditor when auditing the group entity 
Flow Traders U.S. LLC
▪
Used the work of other EY member firms and another (non-EY) auditor to 
perform specific audit procedures at other group entities and account 
balances.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at components of the group, 
together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial information 
to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
Teaming and use of specialists 
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included 
the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed 
client in the business of providing liquidity to financial markets. We included 
specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, sustainability, tax, transfer pricing, 
and have made use of our own actuaries and experts in the area of auditing 
digital assets.
Our focus on climate-related risks and the energy transition
The Board summarized Flow Traders’ ESG (environmental, social and 
governance) focus areas, and reported in the section ‘Our performance’ of the 
management report how the company is addressing climate-related and 
environmental risks also taking into account related regulatory and supervisory 
guidance and recommendations.
As part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which 
climate-related risks and the effects of the energy transition are taken into 
account in estimates and significant assumptions.We read the management 
report and considered whether there is any material inconsistency between the 
non-financial information in section ‘Our performance’ and the financial 
statements.
Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks 
to have a material impact on the financial reporting estimates or significant 
assumptions as at 31 December 2022.

Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and 
regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we 
cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is 
our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, 
taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial 
statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the 
company and its environment and the components of the system of internal 
control, including the risk assessment process and the Board’s process for 
responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and 
how the Risk Committee exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer 
to section ‘Enterprise risk management’ of the Board report for management’s 
(fraud) risk assessment.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control 
and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, 
whistle blower procedures and incident registration. We evaluated the design and 
the implementation of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. As part 
of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with 
respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and 
corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated 
whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud 
is present.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the 
outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were 
indicative of fraud or non-compliance.
As in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of 
controls. For these risks we have performed procedures among others to 
evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may represent a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important 
judgment areas and significant accounting estimates, in particular relating to fair 
value measurement as disclosed in Note 8 to the financial statements. We 
describe the audit procedures responsive to this risk in the description of of our 
audit approach for the key audit matter ‘Fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities held for trading’. We have also used data analysis to identify 
and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or the 
lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions. These risks did however 
not require significant auditor’s attention.
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant directors, 
officers, internal audit, legal, compliance, human resources, risk management 
and regional directors and the Audit Committee.
The fraud risks we identified, enquiries and other available information did not 
lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially 
impacting the view of the financial statements.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations
We performed appropriate audit procedures regarding compliance with the 
provisions of those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the 
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with 
laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect 
on the financial statements from our general industry experience, through 
discussions with the Board, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and 
compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of details of classes of 
transactions, account balances or disclosures.
Given that the company operated in a regulated environment, there is an 
increased risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations that may result in 
fines, litigation or other consequences for the company that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements, as discussed in the ‘Our risk management’ 
section of the Board report. 
We inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and 
remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the 
audit. Finally we obtained written representations that all known instances of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.

Our audit response related to going concern
As disclosed in section ‘2. Going concern’ in the notes to the financial statements, 
the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. When 
preparing the financial statements, the Board made a specific assessment of the 
ability of (the successor of) the company to continue as a going concern and to 
continue its operations for the foreseeable future.
We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with the Board exercising 
professional judgment and maintaining professional scepticism. We considered 
whether the Board’s going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and 
understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or 
otherwise, contains all relevant events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the ability of (the successor of) the company to continue as a going 
concern, and considered whether the update in corporate holding structure 
impacted the continuation of the company’s operations. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties 
about going concern. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of 
most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated 
the key audit matters to the audit committee. The key audit matters are not a 
comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. 
Following the update in the corporate structure of Flow Traders, a new key audit 
matter has been defined.

Key observations
Update in corporate holding structure
On 13 January 2023, Flow Traders N.V. changed its 
corporate holding structure after shareholders’ 
approval. Following this updated structure, Flow 
Traders N.V. merged with Flow Traders S.A. where 
all of Flow Traders N.V.'s assets, liabilities, rights, 
obligations and other legal relationships were 
acquired by Flow Traders S.A. incorporated under 
the laws of Luxembourg. Subsequently, Flow 
Traders N.V. ceased to exist and each shareholder 
received one Flow Traders S.A. Share for each Flow 
Traders N.V. Share. Flow Traders S.A. was 
subsequently redomiciled and converted to Flow 
Traders Ltd., an exempted company limited by 
shares registered in Bermuda. For legal and tax 
purposes, Flow Traders Ltd inherited all rights and 
obligations of Flow Traders N.V. This is disclosed on 
note 35 of the financial statements.
This event took place subsequent to the reporting 
date, but has a significant impact on subsequent 
events and other disclosures given both the impact 
on the company’s governance and regulatory regime 
and the non-routine character of this transaction. An 
adequate disclosure on the consequences of the 
updated corporate holding structure is considered 
significant to the 2022 financial statements of the 
company. Due to the matters described, we 
considered the update in the corporate holding 
structure and required disclosures to be a key audit 
matter.
We periodically met with the Board members 
(executive and non-executive) to understand the 
planning and progress of the updated corporate 
structure. We obtained an understanding of the 
organizational controls and the legal and regulatory 
framework. On a periodic basis, we inquired with the 
Compliance and Legal department of Flow Traders to 
understand and discuss impact on laws and 
regulations, governance and financial reporting.
 
We examined the relevant internal reports, minutes 
of management and board meetings, as well as 
regulatory and legal correspondence to assess 
developments and we performed follow-up 
procedures to examine the company’s assessment of 
the impact on the financial statements and the 
adequacy of related disclosures. We obtained legal 
letters from external counsel and, where 
appropriate, involved our own legal and compliance 
specialists.
 
Finally, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy 
of the disclosures related to the update in the 
corporate structure and whether these disclosures 
comply with EU-IFRS requirements.
Based on our procedures performed, we deem the 
disclosures on the updated corporate structure to be 
reasonable and in compliance with EU-IFRS.

Our audit approach
Key observations
Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for trading
As disclosed in note 8 of the financial statements, 
Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities held for trading is based on 
internally determined theoretical prices, which are 
also used for quoting purposes. As such, valuation 
can differ from closing prices at various stock 
exchanges or prices from clearers, due to market 
illiquidity, variety in opening hours of the stock 
exchanges and the use of hedging instruments. 
The fair values recorded could include estimates 
which are subjective by nature and directly impact 
the gross trading income. We considered the risk of 
fraudulent adjustments in fair valuation. Therefore, 
we identified the valuation of financial assets and 
liabilities held for trading as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, 
assessing the appropriateness of Flow Traders’ 
accounting policies related to valuation of financial 
assets and liabilities according to IFRS 9 “Financial 
Instruments” and IFRS 13 “Fair Value 
Measurement”. In addition, we obtained an 
understanding of the valuation process, including 
verifications done by the Risk and Operations 
department. We evaluated the design and 
implementation of internal controls relevant to fair 
value measurement, involving our own experts in 
the area of valuation of trading positions. 
We performed risk-based sample testing on the 
valuation of individual positions by evaluating the 
internally developed prices against market prices 
from independent sources. 
Furthermore, we evaluated the presentation and 
disclosure in the financial statements for compliance 
and consistency with IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: 
Disclosure” and IFRS 13 on disclosure requirements 
for financial assets and liabilities held for trading, 
including the fair value hierarchy.
Based on our procedures performed, we consider the 
fair value of the financial assets and liabilities held 
for trading to be reasonable and we consider the 
related disclosures to be adequate and appropriate in 
accordance with the requirements under EU-IFRS.

Our audit approach
Key observations
Digital asset and liabilities balances and related income/expenses
Risk Flow Traders trades in cryptographically 
secured digital assets (‘cryptocurrencies’) as 
disclosed in note 18 to the financial statements. The 
digital assets positions are presented as other assets 
held for trading and results are presented as part of 
the gross trading income. Flow Traders also obtains 
loans in digital assets from digital asset exchanges 
and other loan providers as disclosed in note 27 to 
the financial statements, which are presented as 
other liabilities held for trading.
Digital assets are exchangeable directly between two 
parties through decentralized (‘blockchain’) 
networks that record anonymous transaction data. 
Alternatively, direct trades are executed between 
members of non-regulated digital asset exchanges. 
Reference is made to the information on digital 
assets in note 34 Financial risk management. For 
entities that use third parties to store the private 
keys that provides access to the digital assets, 
ownership has to be established based on legal 
terms. This determines whether an entity should 
recognize the assets or a right to the assets. 
We recognized a risk in the existence of the digital 
asset positions. In addition, we recognized a risk of 
incorrect valuation of digital assets, given the high 
volatility and large number of different exchanges. 
We, therefore, considered the existence and 
valuation of digital asset and liability positions and 
the related income or expenses as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, 
assessing the appropriateness of Flow Traders’ 
accounting policies related to the classification and 
measurement of the digital assets and liabilities 
under EU-IFRS.
We evaluated the design and implementation of 
controls related to digital asset assets and liabilities 
by Flow Traders, including reviews performed by the 
Risk and Operations and the Compliance 
departments in onboarding exchanges as well as 
trading in certain digital assets, involving our own 
experts in the area of digital assets. Furthermore, 
we evaluated the design and implementation of the 
daily trades reconciliation controls and procedures 
for deposits and withdrawals with cryptocurrency 
exchanges. Last, by observing the positions at each 
of the exchanges at year-end and subsequently 
testing on the valuation of individual positions by 
comparing the internally developed prices to 
independent sources, we independently tested the 
valuation and existence of the cryptocurrencies 
position of Flow Traders at 31 December 2022.  
In relation to the digital liabilities, we have obtained 
executed loan documentation and tested interest 
payments and redemption payments.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not 
identify any material audit findings in relation to the 
existence or carrying values of the digital assets and 
liabilities.

Report on other information included in the annual 
report
The annual report contains other information in addition to the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other 
information:
▪
is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material 
misstatements
▪
contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code for the management report and the other information as required by 
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and as required by Sections 2:135b 
and 2:145 sub-section 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the remuneration report.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding

considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By 
performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 
2 and Section 2:135b sub-Section 7 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch 
Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than 
the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.
The Board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including 
the management report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code and other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the remuneration report is drawn up 
and published in accordance with Sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub-section 2 of the

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and 
ESEF
Engagement
We were engaged by the Board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V. on 19 May 2016, 
as of the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor ever 
since that date.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) 
of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-
interest entities.
European Single Electronic Reporting Format (ESEF)
Flow Traders N.V. has prepared the annual report in ESEF. The requirements for 
this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to 
regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting 
format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).
In our opinion the annual report prepared in the XHTML format, including the 
(partially) marked-up consolidated financial statements, as included in the 
reporting package by the company, complies in all material respects with the RTS 
on ESEF.
The Board is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial 
statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the Board combines 
the various components into a single reporting package.
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the 
annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.
We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch 
Standard 3950N ’Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor 
het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument’ (assurance 
engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our 
examination included amongst others:
▪
obtaining an understanding of the company’s financial reporting process, 
including the preparation of the reporting package
▪
identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in 
all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing 
further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for 
our opinion, including obtaining the reporting package and performing 
validations to determine whether the reporting package containing the Inline 
XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files, has been 
prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS 
on ESEF examining the information related to the consolidated financial

statements in the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-
ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on 
ESEF.
Description of responsibilities for the financial 
statements
Responsibilities of the management board and the 
supervisory board for the financial statements
The Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code. Furthermore, the Board is responsible for such internal control as the 
Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Board is responsible for 
assessing the ability of (the successor) of the company to continue as a going 
concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, the Board 
should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board either intends to liquidate the company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board should disclose 
events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the ability of (the 
successor of) the company to continue as a going concern in the financial 
statements. 
The Audit Committee undertakes preparatory work for the Board’s decision-
making regarding the supervision of the integrity and quality of the company’s 
financial reporting. Working within the Board, the Audit Committee is charged in 
particular with the supervision with respect to the provision of financial 
information by the company.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that 
allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, 
which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and 
the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional 
scepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, 
ethical requirements and independence requirements. The ‘Information in 
support of our opinion’ section above includes an informative summary of our 
responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.
Our audit further included among others:
▪
Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion
▪
Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control
▪
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the 
Board
▪
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial 
statements, including the disclosures
▪
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Communication
We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this 
respect we also submit an additional report to the Audit Committee in accordance 
with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory 
audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report 
is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.

We provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear 
on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine the 
key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public 
interest.

This document contains “forward-looking statements” which relate to, without limitation, our plans, objectives, 
strategies, future operational performance, and anticipated developments in the industry in which we operate. 
These forward-looking statements are characterized by words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “believe”, “intend”, 
“plan”, “predict”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “should”, “continue”, “expect” and similar expressions, but these 
expressions are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Such forward-looking statements involve 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause circumstances or our actual 
results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future circumstances, results, 
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such factors include, among other things, 
reduced levels of overall trading volume and lower margins; dependence upon prime brokers, ETP issuers, trading 
counterparties, CCPs and custodians; losing access to an important exchange or other trading venue; occurrence 
of a systemic market event; incurrence of trading losses; failures or disruption of our trading platform or our or 
third-party technical infrastructure; risks associated with operational elements of our business and trading 
generally; ineffective risk management systems, processes and strategies; intense competition in our business; 
dependence on continued access to sources of liquidity; capacity constraints of computer and communications 
systems; dependence on third-party software, infrastructure or availability of certain software systems; damage to 
our reputation and the reputation of our industry; loss of key staff or failure to attract and retain other highly 
skilled professionals; changes to applicable regulatory requirements; compliance with applicable laws and 
regulatory requirements, including those specific to our industry; enhanced media and regulatory attention and its 
impact upon public perception of us or of companies in our industry; and other risks. The forward-looking 
statements contained in this document are based on assumptions, beliefs and expectations that we have made in 
light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected 
future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe 
that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable at this time, we cannot assure 
you that such expectations will prove to be correct. Given the risks and uncertainties associated with forward-
looking statements, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Such 
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Accordingly, other than as required 
by applicable law or the rules of the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, we do not undertake any 
obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Any 
forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation or warranty by us or any other person with 
respect to the achievement of the results set out in such statements or that the underlying assumptions used will 
in fact be the case. If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or if any of our underlying assumptions 
prove to be incorrect, our actual results of operations or financial condition could differ materially from that 
described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. Statements regarding the market, industry and 
trends, including the FX market and development in ETP Assets under Management in certain markets, ETP value 
traded in certain markets and Flow Traders’ competitive position are based on outside data and sources.
