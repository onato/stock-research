In 2021, we continued to make strong progress with our 
growth ambitions, expanding our trading operations across 
EMEA, APAC and the US. This supports Flow Traders’ 
commitment to create fairer, more transparent and efficient 
markets for all participants. During the year we onboarded 
additional counterparties to our fast-growing network, 
collaborated with a range of new partners, increased our 
activities across all asset classes we trade in, and were 
actively involved in launching innovative and sustainable 
products. 
Against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic, we remained 
focused on the safety and wellbeing of our people. Our new 
hybrid work model helped ensure we could operate securely 
and effectively, while continuing to deliver the high standard 
of service and experience our counterparties and partners 
have come to expect. Throughout the year, we also 
continued to systematically seek opportunities, presented 
by the fast evolving financial ecosystem and to structurally 
grow our business even further.
Strength of our people
To support our growth, we welcomed more than 160 new 
colleagues in 2021. We opened a branch in Paris, France, 
enhancing our physical presence in one of EMEA’s key 
markets and increasing our proximity to institutional 
counterparties. Flow Traders now has locations in 
Amsterdam, London, New York, Cluj, Singapore, Hong Kong, 
Milan and Paris. As we expand our operations and 
geographical footprint, we continue to embed 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles 
across our organization and find new ways to be more 
sustainable as a business.

Trading highlights
We maintained our position as a leading liquidity provider in 
ETPs on- and off-exchange and hold the number one 
position in EMEA in equity, fixed income, cryptocurrency and 
commodity ETFs. As a leader in this space, we aim to 
contribute to developing innovative and sustainable 
investment products. One example is operating as market 
maker for the world’s first physical carbon ETC, launched by 
SparkChange. We also worked closely with iShares on the 
launch of two sustainable ETFs in EMEA and the US. In line 
with our strategic ecosystem approach, we completed 
a strategic investment in Shape Q, a fintech start-up 
developing a RfQ marketplace for physical energy, green 
energy and environmental commodities.
In FX, we widened our network of prime brokerages and 
have built-up the capability to trade with counterparties on 
a bilateral basis. For spot precious metals, we retained our 
position as a top-three market maker in Europe.
Continued growth
Building upon our successful fixed income ETP trading 
footprint, in 2021, we strategically expanded into 
single-bond market making. Leveraging the accelerating 
trends towards electronification, something Flow Traders 
supports fully, we went live on Bloomberg, TradeWeb and 
MarketAxess as a disclosed liquidity provider. We also went 
live on Neptune as an axe aggregator. Our expanded market 
making activities in fixed income garnered recognition 
externally across media outlets and we were lead sponsor of 
the large Fixed Income Leadership Summit, which took place 
in London in October.
We continue to be extremely proud of how our team stayed 
connected and were able to deliver at the highest level. 
Our success is testament to our unique company culture, 
in which our people demonstrate tremendous dedication, 
collaboration and entrepreneurship. 
We also increased our focus on the development of digital 
assets and decentralized finance, by increasing our crypto 
ETP market share in Europe, becoming market maker in the 
first US crypto ETF, and became part of the Pyth network, 
an effort to increase transparency in the market by sharing 
data as well as completing a strategic investment in D2X. 
We also worked with TP ICAP, acting as the initial liquidity 
provider for their digital assets wholesale trading platform 
launch.
Regulatory changes
In 2021, Flow Traders implemented the new EU IFR/IFD 
regulations and throughout the year continued to engage 
effectively and constructively with regulators. We also 
successfully registered with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) in 
line with regulations relating to cryptocurrency to fiat 
currency trading. During 2022, EU financial market 
regulations will be reviewed and optimized, and we will align 
accordingly. Globally, we expect that new regulatory 
initiatives will address the accelerating global digitalization 
of market structures and we expect to see an increasing 
amount of opportunities related to the global digital assets 
evolution and market data consolidation provided to market 
participants. We have also kept abreast EU sustainable 
finance regulation, particularly with respect to the EU 
Taxonomy.
Strong response to COVID-19 
While year-two of the pandemic brought additional 
challenges, as a business we adapted to the new normal. 
Our business continuity plan remained effective, 
we continued to provide our people with a range of support 
services, and we introduced new flexible work schemes 
across all our offices.

Finally, a priority remains the wellbeing of our team across, 
a team which we would like to put a spotlight on for their 
amazing efforts throughout 2021. We are incredibly proud of 
our team as they continue to demonstrate their dedication 
to building our business and enabling Flow Traders to reach 
its full potential. We would also like to recognize our 
shareholders and other stakeholders for their ongoing 
support and contribution. 
Regards, 
Dennis Dijkstra, Britta Achmann, 
Folkert Joling, Mike Kuehnel and Thomas Wolff
Since joining, Mike has been impressed in particular by Flow 
Traders’ entrepreneurial culture, the commitment towards 
collaboration and the team’s dedication to continuous 
excellence. In these initial first months, he has also gained 
a deep insight into the business, across all asset classes and 
geographies and the technological capabilities. For Mike, 
both Flow Traders’ existing intrinsic value and the firm‘s 
long-term potential as an active participant in the rapidly 
evolving financial markets ecosystem has become truly 
evident.
Looking ahead 
Our key focus in 2022 will be to drive forward our strategy 
even further and leverage the exciting opportunities created 
in the developing financial markets landscape. We will 
create the path for Flow Traders to embrace its next phase 
of development and take our extensive expertise forward to 
grow our business. We will also seek to develop a full ESG 
and sustainability strategy. This will include alignment with 
GRI as well as setting targets and associated KPIs. We will 
also develop and adopt specific policies, including human 
rights policy, environmental policy and supply chain policy.
Our network of counterparties and partners will continue to 
benefit from our ability to provide efficient market access 
and uninterrupted liquidity. We will further expand our 
trading capabilities and infrastructure, collaborate on 
innovative products and further systematically expand our 
footprint as a key player in the global financial market 
ecosystem.
Operationally, we were able maintain our ability to provide 
uninterrupted liquidity and pricing to markets globally. 
This resulted in investors and market participants being 
able to trade in their preferred asset class at any time. We 
increased our societal efforts during the year, expanding the 
work undertaken by the Flow Traders Foundation. In total, 
we supported over 40 charities in 2021. 
Financial overview
Amidst normalizing markets, we had a successful year in 
2021, recording NTI of €384.0 million and demonstrating 
a healthy EBITDA margin of 41% with EBITDA of €159.4 
million. Ultimately, we recorded a Net Profit of €114.9 million 
with basic EPS of €2.63. This, along with our strong capital 
position, allowed the company to pay a total dividend for 
2021 of €1.35 per share to shareholders.
New Management Board member
During the year we welcomed Mike Kuehnel to the 
Management Board as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 
following receipt of regulatory and shareholder approval.
Mike is responsible for Finance, Tax and Investor Relations as 
well as our dedicated Strategy and M&A functions. 
He joined the organization with a stringent focus on 
developing the Flow Traders’ strategy further, further 
strengthening our role in the global financial market 
ecosystem and systematically evolving the functions he 
oversees, in line with the company’s ambitious growth plans. 
Given his background in developing winning strategies for 
leading financial organizations, he brings a wealth of 
experience to the role and strengthens our team further.

We provide this liquidity via two main routes: “on screen” 
which is conducted on stock exchanges where Flow Traders 
is a registered market maker in ETPs and “off exchange” 
where we trade bilaterally with institutional counterparties, 
often through Request for Quote (RfQ) platforms such as 
those operated by Tradeweb, MarketAxess and Bloomberg. 
More recently, we have diversified our market making 
activities into other asset classes, such as Foreign Exchange 
(FX), commodities, cryptocurrencies and fixed income. 
Flow Traders’ group companies can be found in Note 30 on 
page 146 in the Financial Statements. 
What we do
WWe are a financial technology company operating in the 
global financial markets, using our proprietary technology 
platform to provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices in 
thousands of financial products. Flow Traders ensures the 
provision of this liquidity to support the uninterrupted 
functioning of financial markets. Our core trading focus is on 
exchange-traded products (ETPs) and we do this globally, 
enabling investors to buy and sell ETPs efficiently by quoting 
bid and ask prices under virtually all market circumstances. 
Who we are
Flow Traders is a leading global financial technology-
enabled liquidity provider in a wide range of financial 
products, historically specialized in Exchange Traded 
Products (ETPs), now further expanding into other asset 
classes. Flow Traders ensures the provision of liquidity to

This allows investors to continue to buy or sell ETPs or other 
financial instruments under all market circumstances. 
We continuously grow our organization, ensuring that our 
trading desks in Europe, the Americas and Asia can provide 
liquidity across all major exchanges and trading platforms, 
globally, 24 hours a day. Founded in 2004, we continue to

Products
Exchange-traded products (ETPs)
ETPs, the main products that we trade, are often compared 
to mutual funds largely because they are both baskets of 
shares, bonds, or commodities. However, that is where the 
similarity ends. Unlike most mutual funds, the majority of 
ETPs simply track an index without trying to outperform 
such indices. ETPs have open-ended fund structures rather 
than closed-end and, unlike mutual funds, can be 
continuously bought and sold on trading venues during 
trading hours and off-exchange at all times. 
ETPs provide investors with exposure to a wide variety of 
underlying assets, ranging from ETPs that replicate the 
composition of a particular equity index, to those that 
provide investors with exposure to assets in specific sectors 
or countries, to commodities, or to currencies. ETPs also 
enable investors to create and manage diversified 
investment portfolios in an efficient manner, as well as 
enabling them to switch exposures at any given moment 
during trading days. There are broadly three main categories 
within ETPs in which we trade: 
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
This category is the most traded, when compared to ETCs 
and ETNs. ETFs derive their value from shares or bonds held 
in proportion to an index. For example, a Euro Stoxx 50 ETF 
would hold the same shares as the Euro Stoxx 50 index, 
in approximately the same proportions. Fixed-income ETFs 
derive their value from a portfolio of debt instruments. 
For example, bonds included in the Barclays US Treasury 1-3 
Year Term Index. ETFs are the most widespread among ETPs 
as measured by Assets under Management (AuM).

This increases the ETPs’ Assets under Management (AuM). 
In this way, the issuance of ETPs through APs provides the 
issuers with access to a broad investor market without 
having to support a complex and costly trading 
infrastructure which would be non-core to their business. 
Redemption is the reverse of the creation process: the AP 
transfers ETPs to their issuer in exchange for the underlying 
assets (or a cash equivalent). The issuer then cancels the 
ETPs it received. This decreases the ETPs’ AuM. 
Secondary market
The secondary market is where ETP trading takes place 
between market participants, similar to the trading of 
ordinary shares, at market-determined prices. Secondary 
market participants include institutional and retail investors, 
liquidity providers and APs. Secondary markets include 
exchanges and other automated trading venues, as well as 
off-exchange trading between market participants such as 
large institutional investors.
Fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC)
Leveraging the scale and capabilities of our ETP proprietary 
technology-enabled trading platform, Flow Traders has 
been able to also trade an increasing volume of the 
underlying asset classes in 2021 mainly in FICC. The fixed 
income markets in particular is experiencing a wave of 
electronification which is expanding the opportunities 
available to non-bank liquidity providers such as Flow 
Traders.
Flow Traders started providing liquidity in FX as a separate 
asset class during 2018 and we have invested further in the 
business in order to drive growth in 2021. We provide 
liquidity in an increasing number of FX pairs on spot and 
futures in the EMEA and APAC markets to a fast-growing 
The ETP ecosystem
The ETP ecosystem is made up of a number of participants 
who together make ETP investing and trading possible. 
These include investors, ETP issuers, exchanges and other 
trading venues and authorized participants, who can also act 
as liquidity providers, such as Flow Traders. The ETP 
ecosystem can be further divided into two markets: the 
primary market and the secondary market.
Primary market
Interaction in the primary market takes place between 
authorized participants (APs) and the issuers, who either 
issue or cancel ETPs. This is done in reaction to market 
demand and is called the creation and redemption process. 
APs can create ETPs with the issuer by transferring the 
underlying assets (or cash equivalent) to the issuer in return 
for a corresponding number of newly issued ETPs. 
Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)
ETCs typically derive their value from a commodity index, 
such as the Bloomberg Commodity Index, although in some 
cases they derive it from just a single commodity, such as 
gold or oil, or a certain currency. For example, the SPDR 
Gold Shares ETC tracks the value of physical gold. ETCs may 
hold physical assets, but exposure can also be held through 
derivatives of the underlying commodity, in combination 
with cash.
Exchange-traded notes (ETNs)
ETNs are types of unsecured, unsubordinated debt 
securities issued by an underwriting bank. The returns of 
ETNs are based on the performance of the index being 
tracked. For example, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term 
Futures Index TR ETN would track the S&P 500 VIX 
Short-Term Futures volatility index.

Liquidity Provider
Leading liquidity provider
Flow Traders has two main roles in the financial ecosystem. 
The first is as a liquidity provider. In this role, we help 
maintain and improve the overall transparency and 
efficiency of the ecosystem, by quoting bid and ask prices 
for financial products like ETPs, bonds, cryptocurrency, 
FX and other products on trading venues, as well as 
off-exchange to institutional investors, which market 
participants can trade against. By providing liquidity we 
make it easier for investors to buy and sell financial products 
at a price that should reflect the (relation with the) current 
price of the underlying asset, and contribute to lower trading 
costs.
 
Another role we play in the ETP landscape is as an 
Authorized Participant (AP). We have AP-agreements in 
place with all the major ETP issuers. These agreements link 
the primary and the secondary ETP market and allow us to 
either create or redeem the ETPs and optimize our role as 
a leading liquidity provider in ETPs.
Flow Traders also trades cryptocurrency, which we consider 
to be a key part of our FICC proposition, which is a growing 
part of our overall business and a key strategic focus. Flow 
Traders is the number one market maker in cryptocurrency 
ETPs in Europe being active on 15 exchanges globally, 
providing 24/7 liquidity. We are also a leading spot OTC 
liquidity provider. We have seen that there has been 
a continued adoption of this asset class by institutional 
investors with subsequent inflows in cryptocurrency ETPs 
and ETNs. Flow Traders has continued to participate in the 
development of the digital asset and decentralized finance 
space through joining the Pyth network, supporting the 
launch of Reactive Markets’ Switchboard and providing 
liquidity and partnering with TP ICAP to be one of the initial 
liquidity providers on the launch of their innovative 
wholesale trading platform for cryptocurrency.
Flow Traders expects that this diversification will lead to 
a larger contribution of underlying asset classes to the total 
value traded. It will also improve our ETP trading capabilities 
and improve our ability to grow NTI structurally. In 2021, 
there were further positive NTI contributions from non-ETP 
trading activities as returns from investments in trading 
diversification became evident. Ultimately, Flow Traders’ 
goal is to become a one-stop shop liquidity platform in 
financial markets globally.
number of counterparties on an expanding number of 
platforms, including Bloomberg’s FX platform. In 2021, 
Flow Traders maintained its top three market maker position 
on major FX ECNs (Electronic Communications Networks) in 
spot metals.
In commodities in general, Flow Traders has always been 
active in the ETP market as well as the underlying asset 
classes. Moreover, we hold physical storage as collateral 
with our prime brokers if physical delivery is demanded by 
counterparties.
In Fixed Income, 2021 saw continued ETP market growth. 
Flow Traders has a strong position in this market, particularly 
in EMEA and in the US. By leveraging the infrastructure of 
Flow Traders’ leading fixed income ETP trading footprint, 
a multi-year investment has enabled an expansion into 
single bond market making in 2021. Flow Traders is 
supporting and advancing electronification, transparency 
and cost efficiency across the fixed income markets. 
Flow Traders is now continuously quoting in excess of 9000 
ISINs across USD and Euro corporate credit and emerging 
market sovereign bonds and is providing pricing on all major 
platforms including Bloomberg, TradeWeb, MarketAxess 
and Neptune.

Cutting edge proprietary technology 
platform
Developing software in-house 
As noted, we are a technology company operating in the 
financial industry. As such, technology lies at the core of our 
business, enabling us to provide liquidity in a variety of 
market environments across the globe. We trade using 
proprietary and scalable software with the vast majority of 
our applications developed in-house. These include pricing 
and trading software, market data processing tools, 
pre-trade risk controls, and other risk and compliance tools. 
This is the main reason that our technology department 
makes up over 40 percent of our total staff and is our 
largest employee group.
One of our software platform’s core features is its modular 
design, which allows us to rapidly test and implement 
ongoing enhancements. This also means we can easily and 
cost-effectively expand our coverage of securities, asset 
classes, and geographical markets as we grow the business.
In 2021 our total technology expenses increased by 8 
percent versus 2020 as we invested further in the trading 
business. Our technology expenses represented 41 percent 
of our total fixed expenses and the number of technology 
FTEs grew to 244 from 221 in 2021, in order to support the 
execution of our growth strategy. Technology remains the 
largest employee group at Flow Traders.
Pricing
Pricing accurately 
Being able to accurately price the various financial products 
that we provide liquidity in is vital to the success of our 
business. Get it wrong, and we risk not winning the trade or 
losing money due to bad prices. Our experience in 
establishing the pricing and hedging across different 
products in a variety of market conditions means we can 
offer competitive bid and ask prices, while still covering our 
trading costs and locking in transaction profit. We achieve 
this using pre-set hedging strategies, which, when possible, 
instantly reduce our market exposure, creating a market-
neutral position. This approach is also taken with respect to 
providing liquidity in all asset classes we trade such as 
cryptocurrency and corporate credit.

Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, 
may deem relevant. Our intentions in relation to dividends 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control.
The Management Board, subject to the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, may decide to make allocations to 
reserves and therefore decides how much of the profit will 
be allocated to reserves. The profits remaining shall be at 
the disposal of the General Meeting. 
Reserves and dividend proposal for the financial 
year 2021
Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the company’s Articles of 
Association, the Management Board, with the approval of 
the Supervisory Board, has decided that of the profit for 
2021 (totaling €114.9 million), an amount of €55.9 million 
shall be added to the reserves. The remaining amount of 
€59.0 million is at the disposal of the General Meeting.
It is proposed to the General Meeting that a total cash 
dividend of €1.35 per share will be paid out to shareholders 
for the financial year 2021, subject to a 15 percent dividend 
withholding tax (dividendbelasting). An interim cash 
dividend of €1.00 per share was paid out on 20 August 2021. 
This means that the final cash dividend proposal to the 
General Meeting is €0.35 per share. Subject to approval by 
the General Meeting on 29 April 2022, shares will trade 
ex-dividend on 3 May 2022. Payment of the final dividend is

Dividend policy and dividend proposal 
Dividend policy
Flow Traders intends to pay dividends annually in two 
instalments, with a target aggregate dividend pay-out ratio 
of at least 50 percent of the company’s net profits realized 
during the financial year. The Management Board may 
decide, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, that the 
profits realized during a financial year will fully or partially 
be appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. 
A distribution of (interim) dividends is subject to applicable 
rules and regulations, the Articles of Association of the 
company, the By-Laws of the Management Board, and the 
By-Laws of the Supervisory Board.
It is anticipated that our interim dividends will be declared 
and paid following the publication of our results for the first 
half of each year. However, there can be no assurance that in 
any given year a dividend will be proposed or declared.
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and 
timing thereof will depend on a number of factors, including 
legal and regulatory requirements, future profits, financial 
conditions, general economic and business conditions, 
future prospects and such other factors as the Management

Our strategy 
We will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing to grow 
our business and diversify into other asset classes. 
This should result in increasing our Net Trading Income (NTI), 
while maintaining our desired risk profile, controlling costs, 
and securing and attracting the right talent. Increasing our 
NTI involves increasing the product of volume and the net 
margin we capture per trade, where volume is the value of 
products we trade and the net margin is the margin we 
capture per trade after the corresponding exposure has 
been hedged. Our risk profile is characterized by having no 
directional opinion on the market. In other words, our results 
do not depend on the direction of market prices. 
By expanding our presence as a liquidity provider in both the 
ETPs and underlying asset classes, Flow Traders can 
maximize the growth of its NTI. 
By growing our presence in the global financial market as 
a liquidity provider, we build a foundation to support our 
long-term growth trend. By growing our presence in 
underlying asset classes, we expect to improve our 
performance in the future, including during those periods 
where the trading activity in the market may slow down. 
This is aligned with our ESG ambition and mission. Growing 
our presence in the financial markets through expanding 
and deepening our ETP trading footprint as well as 
improving pricing and access to fixed income, commodity 
and FX liquidity will only make markets more efficient and 
reduce trading costs for investors globally. It will also enable 
the financing of the shift towards a sustainable world 
economy. 
Our ambition and strategy 
Our strategic ambition
Our ambition is to become a one-stop shop liquidity 
platform in financial markets globally.
Our market and environment
We operate in a highly dynamic world, which is characterized 
by mega trends such as globalization and technological 
development which only accelerates the pace of change. 
This only intensifies the competition in our markets, 
for example by through the increasing electronification of 
trading enabled by technology developments. Moreover, 
our markets are characterized by ever increasing regulation. 
This typically creates greater transparency and a more level 
playing field within our markets, which plays to our strength 
as a technology-enabled liquidity provider. Yet the markets’ 
core functions remains the same: transferring risk between 
various market participants. This is where we add value. 
Accordingly, our focus will continue to be on providing 
liquidity in more and more products in the financial markets 
with a core focus on ETPs.
Our business principles
Our business principles are being flexible, agile and focused 
on continuous improvements. To be successful, 
we recognize that we need to perform well across all areas 
of the business. Achieving this involves diligently studying 
the markets and our responses to them, and using our 
resources where they have the greatest impact. 
The outcome of this process defines whether or not we have 
a competitive edge.
We create value in a number of financial and 
non-financial ways for a variety of stakeholders. 
Supported by our proprietary technology 
platform, we provide liquidity in financial 
products that helps contribute to more efficient 
markets by lowering overall trading costs, 
delivering greater execution quality and market 
transparency. For our employees, we provide a 
compelling and constantly evolving work 
environment that enables them to develop to 
their full potential. We take an active interest in 
the societies in which we operate, contributing to 
local learning initiatives and charities through the 
Flow Traders Foundation. And we care for our 
investors by focusing on growing profitably and 
providing dividend returns. Our value creation 
model shows how we create value and the impact 
our business has on our stakeholders.

global ETP AuM grew from €6,422 billion at the end of 2020 
to €9,030 billion by the end of 2021. This growth is expected 
to continue, as investors continue to invest in low-cost, 
transparent and easy-to-trade passive investment 
strategies. This contributes to the long-term value creation 
of Flow Traders’ strategy.
We believe there are a number of reasons for this trend to 
continue, including beyond 2022: one is that investors are 
attracted to the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables 
them to follow clearly how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid and 
available at low-cost and can be bought and sold easily 
during market hours. A third reason is that ETPs can be 
composed of financial instruments from almost any asset 
class, sector or location, providing investors access to 
markets that would normally be difficult to reach.
differences that are realized between buying and selling 
related or correlating assets. Whether that is between the 
ETPs we buy or sell, and the prices we pay or receive for the 
underlying or related financial instruments to mitigate our 
risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager and do 
not have our own Assets under Management (AuM). We also 
do not develop or make products, do not provide any 
services and do not have (consumer) clients. Our value chain 
comprises, among others, of our institutional 
counterparties, prime brokers and regulators. 
ETPs
In recent years, the ETP ecosystem has continued to mature 
and experience significant growth in both Asset under 
Management and number of products. According to ETFGI, 
Moreover, in order to drive forward our growth agenda we 
rely on the talent and integrity of all colleagues at Flow 
Traders in line with our focus on business ethics and creating 
sustainable employment.
Markets and trends
Our business
In 2021 we had access to more than 180 trading venues in 40 
countries around the world. We provide liquidity in over 
8,000 ETP listings on- and off-exchange, which is around 60 
percent of all ETPs globally.
Off-exchange, we provide liquidity in ETPs on a request-
for-quote basis to more than 2,000 institutional 
counterparties across the globe, including banks, asset 
managers, pension funds, insurance companies, family 
offices, hedge funds, and others and this number is 
increasing on an almost daily basis. 
In addition to ETPs we provide liquidity in similar instruments 
whose value is correspondingly affected by a change in the 
value of underlying or related assets, such as futures or 
bonds. 
During 2021, we continued to implement our diversification 
initiatives into other asset classes and provided liquidity as 
a market maker including in FX, fixed income, commodities 
and cryptocurrency.
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider we 
generally do not have a directional opinion on the market. 
In other words, our results do not depend on the direction of 
market prices. Our NTI is realized through the small price

ETP products, as those 10 determine roughly 55 percent to 
65 percent of the total market volumes. The total ETP value 
traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) was €3.7 trillion in 
2021, including China, while the total ETP value traded at our 
APAC offices was €96.8 billion. Flow Traders had a 
successful year in 2021 in APAC in terms of trading volumes, 
confirming the contribution of specific recent investments 
made in the region. In 2021, Flow Traders deepened its 
partnership with the HKEX by acting as a liquidity provider 
across a number of their new product suites.
The EMEA ETP market had a total ETP value traded of 
€2.0 trillion in 2021. Our total ETP value traded from our 
Europe offices was €703.3 billion in 2021. We remained the 
number one liquidity provider in ETPs in EMEA and managed 
to grow our on- and off-exchange presence further. 
In APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with large 
differences in trading volumes, trading costs, regulation and 
maturity across the financial markets. Volumes traded in the 
APAC region remained dominated by the top-10 most traded 
Review of 2021 
Global ETP markets grew by 38 percent in 2021 measured in 
AuM, driven again by the popularity of equity and fixed 
income ETPs. Annual global inflows of ETP AuM were 
€1,138 billion in 2021 (2020: €617 billion in 2020  – source 
ETFGI). Overall trading activity in 2021 increased as the 
markets continued to absorb the impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic as well as increased retail investor activity, 
particularly in the US.
Global coverage
Following Flow Traders’ recent expansion, we trade globally 
from four offices: in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, New York and 
Singapore. In addition to our branch offices in London and 
Milan, we announced the opening of a branch office in Paris 
in 2021 which is consistent with Flow Traders’ growth strategy 
to deepen its geographical footprint and it will enable us to 
increase our proximity to institutional counterparties. In 2021, 
Flow Traders ETP value traded once again surpassed the €1 
trillion mark. The largest ETP market is still in the United 
States, where total ETP value traded (on-exchange and 
off-exchange) was €31.1 trillion in 2021. Our New York office’s 
total ETP value traded was €740.6 billion in 2021, markedly 
higher than in 2020 and, for the third year in a row, a record 
year for Flow Traders US since inception. With institutional 
trading gaining further momentum in 2021, Flow Traders US 
continued to grow and deepen its overall presence in this 
important market. In December, Flow Traders made a further 
strategic investment in Members Exchange (MEMX). 
MEMX was founded in 2019 as a new US equities exchange 
and other members of the investor group include leading 
banks, retail brokers, asset managers as well as market 
makers. This investment underlines our long-term 
commitment to the US equities ecosystem as we seek to 
grow our business and presence further.

In general, we believe we can accelerate growth in all 
regions in the coming years, as the pace of electronification 
of trading intensifies across financial markets and we 
increasingly leverage on our technology and trading 
knowledge to progress the trading of other asset classes. 
In terms of the ongoing discussions on regulation, 
we continue to anticipate changes that further support 
a level playing field.
Fixed income
Electronic trading has increased dramatically over the last 
few years. For example, 45% of Euro-denominated 
investment-grade (IG) credit is now executed electronically, 
reaching 75% on a ticket-count basis. The COVID-19 
pandemic has only further accelerated this trend with the 
buy-side favouring the use of RfQ platforms to an even 
greater extent. This increase has contributed to the 
approaching inflection point of electronification in credit 
markets, comparable to what we have witnessed in other 
markets, such as foreign exchange (FX), US equity options 
and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This transition is being 
driven by better pre- and post-trade information, the rise of 
algorithmic trading and new trading protocols being 
embraced by the buy- and sell-side. Initially driven by 
regulation such as MiFID II, it is likely that the regulatory 
landscape will continue to accelerate this electronification 
trend. 
By leveraging the infrastructure of Flow Traders’ leading 
fixed income ETP trading footprint, a multi-year investment 
has enabled an expansion into single bond market making. 
Flow Traders is supporting and advancing electronification, 
In Europe we have cemented our position as the leading 
liquidity provider by continuing to grow our presence on 
different venues and grow the number of counterparties. 
We have established a connection with virtually all ETP 
issuers active in Europe and we continued to grow our 
institutional counterparty-base substantially in 2021. MiFID II 
continues to have a beneficial impact on our counterparty 
base, as investors increased their focus on best execution, 
regardless of research access. With the recent expansion of 
our offices into Milan, which opened in 2020, and Paris in 
2021 alongside the launch of liquidity provision in other asset 
classes, we have the building blocks in place to further 
increase our presence in Europe in 2022.
In the Americas, our ETP value traded continued to grow in 
2021, but remains relatively limited compared to the overall 
market size. We believe there is significant growth potential 
in Fixed Income ETFs, developed market equity ETFs and 
institutional trading. Institutional trading continued to gain 
mass in 2021 and is expected to grow further in 2022. We will 
continue to expand the number of products traded, 
the number of venues we trade on and the number of 
counterparties we are connected to in the US.
In Asia we continue to increase our participation in the 
markets where we are already active, and expand into new 
markets. At the same time, we remain focused on markets 
that are potentially opening up, such as China, by capitalizing 
on our experience and increasing our business development 
capacities. We have also been increasing our footprint and 
visibility in the region, supporting our institutional trading 
and reaffirming our role in the regional ETP ecosystem.
ETP market remains a high growth market
We still see significant opportunities for growth in the ETP 
market, driven by the widely expected expansion of this 
industry in the near future. This is due to a number of 
changes within the asset management industry, including: 
	
◾
the continuing shift to global electronic trading, which 
cuts costs and maximizes efficiency and transparency;
	
◾
a shift in asset growth from active strategies to more 
cost-effective, passive strategies;
	
◾
increasing ETP adoption globally among institutions, 
intermediaries and retail investors;
	
◾
long-term shifts driven by regulators looking to 
increase financial stability and transparency.
To take advantage of this expected growth, we aim to 
expand our presence further in all areas of ETP trading in all 
regions.

It is clear that digital assets are here to stay and Flow Traders 
has the strong conviction that they will drive significant 
change across the financial markets in the coming years not 
only from a trading perspective but also in terms of asset 
allocation by the buy-side.
Strategic ecosystem approach
During 2021, Flow Traders designed and implemented 
a strategic ecosystem approach to accelerate the execution 
of our strategy and as well as capturing more of the overall 
value chain. This is a natural evolution given Flow Traders 
position within the financial markets ecosystem and our 
core capabilities. The focus is on three key building themes 
across our three strategic focus areas of equities, fixed 
income and crypto. These themes are: platforms, data, 
and connectivity and are, in of themselves product agnostic.
This translated into several strategic investments / actions:
asset market infrastructure namely in custody solutions, 
prime brokerage, data and analytics, AML-KYC and other risk 
solutions, digital property rights, digital identity solutions as 
well as DEFI ecosystems. 
Crypto ETPs are another clear example of regulatory and 
investor acceptance of digital assets. They solve liquidity 
and custody issues many investors, both retail and 
institutional, face by having an exchange-listed instrument 
with registered market makers providing liquidity under all 
market circumstances. 
Flow Traders’ crypto liquidity provision commenced 4 years 
ago and spans OTC spot as well as ETPs. Flow Traders is the 
number 1 liquidity provider in crypto ETPs in Europe with 
a circa 45% market share. The digital assets space is well 
suited to Flow Traders’ technology-enabled capabilities.
transparency and cost efficiency across the fixed income 
markets. We are now continuously quoting in excess of 9000 
ISINs across USD and Euro corporate credit and emerging 
market sovereign bonds and providing pricing on all major 
platforms including Bloomberg, TradeWeb, Neptune and 
MarketAxess. 
Cryptocurrency / digital assets
In recent years, cryptocurrency has emerged as an 
important asset class with increased institutional 
acceptance. This rise of digital assets has naturally been 
seen increased trading volumes. For example, the combined 
trading volume of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures 
surged to over $32 trillion in 2021, according to The Block 
Research, which represents a 338% increase compared to 
2020 trading volumes. In 2020, bitcoin and ether futures saw 
a combined trading volume of over $7 trillion. The increased 
popularity of cryptocurrencies has also driven the 
development of institutional grade and regulated digital

contributed the most to our NTI which reflects that region’s 
high level of flow visibility and counterparty and product 
coverage. There was also significant contributions from the 
US and APAC. During 2021, we were able to successfully 
leverage the recent investments made in the US and in fixed 
income and cryptocurrency.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, Flow Traders reported NTI of 
€80 million which reflected generally higher activity levels 
in the markets.
Market volatility
In 2021 market volatility declined from the levels witnessed 
in 2020. The main volatility took place in during January, 
February and December with average VIX levels of 25, 
24 and 22 respectively. For the remainder of 2021, markets 
were for the most part more normalized.
Operational expenses
On the cost side, we maintained a firm discipline on costs 
with fixed operating expenses amounting to €122.2 million 
in 2021 (2020: €118.7 million), which is within the guided fixed 
cost growth rate of maximum 15 percent for 2021. The main 
drivers of the increase in fixed expenses were technology 
investments to support diversification initiatives and 
efficiency improvements as well as new hires. FTEs 
increased by 11 percent to 613. There were also €2.5 million 
of additional one-off expenses in 2021 (2020: €11.4 million) 
relating to the continued activation of the business 
continuity plan. Variable employee expenses decreased to 
€102.5 million (2020: €228.1 million) which reflects the 
lower overall financial performance of the business during 
the year. 
Financial overview 
Net Trading Income
The market environment in 2021 was more normalized 
compared to the exceptional market circumstances seen in 
2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Volatility in 
2021 was on average lower than seen in 2020 as measured 
by the VIX index (19.88 vs 29.49). By way of contrast, the VIX 
reached a high of 85.47 in 2020 whereas the high in 2021 was 
37.51. Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic, the global 
economy as well as the equity and bond markets continued 
to receive considerable support from governments and 
central banks. For example, the Federal Reserve System 
continued to purchase fixed income ETPs throughout the 
course of 2021.
Given this market backdrop and our leading global ETP 
trading footprint, Flow Traders total value traded in 2021 
grew to €5.7 trillion (2020: €5.2 trillion), of which 
€1.54 trillion (2020: €1.52 trillion) was traded in ETPs 
(on-exchange and off-exchange). The rest was traded in 
related financial products to facilitate competitive pricing in 
ETPs as well trading in other asset classes, such as fixed 
income, FX and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, ETP market 
value traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) also 
increased during the same period to €36.8 trillion (2020: 
€34.9 trillion).
The market environment experienced in 2021 along with 
Flow Traders’ own pricing, hedging and risk management 
capabilities translated into Net Trading Income (NTI) of 
€384 million (2020: €933 million) - the second most 
successful year for Flow Traders. Europe, our home market, 
Overall, 2021 saw a more normalized market 
environment compared to the extraordinary 
market circumstances experienced in 2020 with 
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Notwithstanding this market environment, 2021 
was a successful year for Flow Traders. 
We recorded Net Trading Income in 2021 of  €384 
million (2020: €933 million) and significant 
progress was made in terms of executing the 
strategic growth agenda with the expansion into 
single bond market making, broadening and 
deepening our digital assets footprint and 
completing several strategic investments.

IFR/IFD came into force on 26 June 2021 and replaced CRR 
from a regulatory capital requirements perspective. As at 
31 December 2021, our regulatory capital requirements 
under IFR/IFD were €243 million. As Flow Traders’ total 
regulatory capital stood at €483 million, this resulted in an 
excess capital position of €240 million. Trading capital 
stood at €611 million at the end of 2021 the fourth quarter 
(€772 million as at 31 December 2020).
Cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities reduced to €244.8 
million in 2021 (2020: €271.3 million) reflecting lower net 
trading income and net profit generation than the previous 
year. Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to 
€13.8 million in 2021 (2020: €9.4 million) as additional 
Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
continued to demonstrate strong operational leverage with 
an EBITDA margin of 41% in 2021 (2020: 63%) with EBITDA of 
€159.4 million (2020: €586.6 million).   
Capital base
During the year we continued to maintain a strong, stable 
capital base, comfortably exceeding both our regulatory 
and prime broker capital requirements. We paid out a €1.00 
interim dividend in August 2021 and propose to pay €0.35 as 
a final dividend over 2021. Over the course of 2021 we 
therefore aim to return a total of €1.35 per share through 
dividends to our shareholders, which represents a 51 percent 
dividend pay-out ratio.
strategic investments were made in line with our dedicated 
strategic ecosystem alongside continued investment in the 
business. Lastly, cash outflows from financing activities in 
2021 amounted to €234.6 million (2020: €258.9 million) as 
lower dividends were offset by increased share buybacks in 
connection with various employee incentive plans.
Growth
We continued to grow our global team, trading strategies 
and infrastructure in 2021. We increased our institutional 
counterparty base globally to over 2,000 as well as being 
connected to over 180 trading venues. To facilitate this 
growth, we continued to grow the business during the year 
across all regions, resulting in an increase in the number of 
FTEs to 613 by year-end (2021: 554).
Outlook
In order to accelerate the structural growth in the core ETP 
business as well in fixed income and digital assets, guidance 
remains for a maximum growth in fixed operating expenses 
of c. 15% for 2022. FTEs are expected to grow by c. 10% in 
2022.
Substantial progress has been made in the detailed and 
thorough review of Flow Traders’ capital structure as 
announced at the time of Q3 21 trading update and Flow 
Traders will remain focused on all arising opportunities to 
create shareholder value through systematic capital 
management going forward.

based on merit, and merit alone. See page 33
	
◾
Sustainable employment

employment, which refers to the extent to which 
workers are able and willing to remain working for Flow 
Traders. Flow Traders creates such a context by offering 
high-quality jobs, developing talent in-house,

instruments under all market circumstances. 
See pages 32-33
	
◾
Good corporate governance
Pursuing the highest standards of good corporate 
governance to make sure we take actions that have 
a beneficial effect on all our stakeholders. Corporate 
governance is the system of rules, practices,

Flow Traders ESG ambition is to ensure to smooth 
functioning of markets which will assist in financing the 
transition towards a sustainable society by:
	
◾
Investing in our trading capabilities to ensure that 
sustainable investment products can be traded easily 
and efficiently;
	
◾
Promoting the drive for fair and transparent markets, 
in continuous collaboration with the financial and 
investment community;
	
◾
Operating with high ethical standards at all times and 
compliance with laws and regulations and respecting 
human rights;
	
◾
Promoting sustainable tangible practices within our 
company and towards our communities, by respecting 
and developing our people and by supporting our 
ecosystem.
EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system, which will be 
used to determine, and report on, which activities are 
sustainable, through the creation of activity specific 
sustainability criteria. As financial and non-financial actors 
must report on their performance in reference to the same 
criteria, the Taxonomy will create a common language for 
companies, investors and society alike. Corporate activities 
(known as economic activities under the Taxonomy 
regulation), will need to be aligned with the following three 
elements to be considered sustainable or “green” under the 
Taxonomy Regulation: a) Substantially contribute to at least 
one of the six environmental objectives per the Technical 
Screening Criteria (TSC) defined in the Regulation; b) Do no 
significant harm to any of the remaining five environmental 
objectives; and c) Comply with the minimum social 
Flow Traders ESG mission and ambition
The world is facing significant challenges in ensuring 
a sustainable future for our people and our planet. 
Many national and international initiatives are addressing 
these challenges. Every organization will have to play its 
own role in the transition to a sustainable society, depending 
on its impact and its opportunities.
The finance sector can be an important contributor to the 
global sustainability agenda and can promote sustainable 
finance, by incorporating environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) factors into investment decision-making, 
and by supporting the allocation of capital to sustainable 
initiatives.
Flow Traders has a critical and important role to play in the 
global financial ecosystem and ensures that financial 
markets function in an orderly manner. We serve the real 
economy by allowing investors, including pension funds and 
retail investors, to manage their risks by being able to trade 
at all times. Moreover, market makers such as ourselves, 
have made it much cheaper and more efficient to trade than 
in previous decades, which benefits everyone. In this key 
role Flow Traders has a responsibility to contribute to the 
financial stability and the sustainable agenda in the 
countries in which we operates (see Flow Traders’ value 
creation model). As a key market participant, at the core of 
the financial ecosystem, Flow Traders will support the 
acceleration of the transition towards sustainable growth 
and finance, notably by providing liquidity in the ever 
growing suite of ESG ETFs.
Shared value
Flow Traders was founded more than 15 years ago, and in 
that time we have developed an innovative and 
entrepreneurial spirit that enables us to grow and explore 
new markets. We recognize that with this growth come 
responsibilities that go beyond our core business, and that 
our activities influence the society in which we live and 
operate. 
At the same time, society has a very real impact on our 
business and operations. Both the Management Board and 
the Supervisory Board pay close attention to a wide variety 
of developments and trends that could pose either a risk or 
an opportunity and in 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic as well 
as Brexit implementation were such events. Another is the 
opportunity that comes with the shift to digitalization, which 
is helping make financial products and services more widely 
available to investors across society.
For us Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is about 
creating shared value. To better help manage our impact 
and our need to create shared value, we have divided our 
ESG focus across nine main focus areas. We have also 
connected these 9 ESG focus areas with three corresponding 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that 
we believe are particularly relevant for Flow Traders. 
Below we outline our priorities within each of these ESG 
focus areas, and explain our extended efforts to positively 
impact the world around us. At the end of this chapter we 
provide more information on our SDGs.

Stakeholder expectations and materiality 
analysis
As a first step towards the creation of our ESG strategy, 
we performed in late 2020, a materiality analysis to identify 
the ESG related issues that should be our main areas of 
focus. Based on internal and external developments we 
determined a shortlist of relevant topics. To determine the 
priority of the relevant topics we first launched 
a stakeholder consultation process to identify the ESG 
related issues that various stakeholders believe should be 
our main areas of focus, through a survey. Flow Traders has 
had the feedback from a wide selection of stakeholders, 
including shareholders, counterparties and issuers and 
employees. These stakeholders were selected because Flow 
Traders directly influences their interests. Flow Traders’ 
stakeholders recognize that we play a role in ESG from 
numerous standpoints: Flow Traders as a participant in the 
financial markets ecosystem, Flow Traders as a business 
providing services and as a corporate actor. In each of these 
roles, Flow Traders has different responsibilities. An internal 
consultation was held with internal management to 
prioritize the issues with which Flow Traders can have the 
most economic, environmental and societal impact. 
The outcomes of the stakeholder and management 
prioritization is presented in the materiality matrix below 
which was validated by both the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board, helped us determine our ESG priorities. 
The x-axis represents the prioritization by internal 
management and the y-axis the prioritization by 
stakeholders. On the basis of the materiality matrix Flow 
Traders has identified 9 key issues, of which five are 
considered highly material.  
Accordingly, we report a nil value for the Eligibility EU 
Taxonomy percentage for 2021. As a global liquidity 
provider, we have no direct access to the entities for which 
we hold ETP, equity, debt or other instruments on our 
balance sheet as at 31 December 2021. Moreover, 
2021 annual accounts including Taxonomy information are 
not available. We have not provided disclosure regarding 
voluntary EU Eligible Taxonomy percentages as our balance 
sheet reflects a point-in-time position and our trading 
books reflect the extremely short holding periods in relation 
to the underlying assets.  In our view, a voluntary eligible EU 
Taxonomy percentage will not provide readers of this report 
any insight to our contribution to Climate Change Mitigation 
and/or Climate Change Adaption.
safeguards. The European Commission (EC) is defining TSC 
for the six environmental objectives at a sector and 
economic activity level. The TSC for Climate Change 
Adaptation (CCA) and Climate Change Mitigation (CCM) have 
already been defined in the EU Taxonomy Climate 
Delegated Act.
The EU Taxonomy Regulation was adopted by the European 
Parliament in June 2020 and is now binding throughout the 
EU. The EU Taxonomy currently applies to Flow Traders as 
Flow Traders falls under the scope of the Non Financial 
Reporting Directive (NFRD) and as an Investment Firm under 
IFR/IFD.

products (ETPs) and other financial products to be traded 
across the world’s markets, by continuously quoting bid and 
ask prices. As an innovative segment of global financial 
markets, ETPs have introduced efficiencies and cut 
investment costs substantially for a wide range of investors, 
from pension funds to retail investors. Increased liquidity, 
higher execution quality, and lower overall trading costs are 
just some of the benefits that liquidity providers, such as 
Flow Traders, offer through these innovative financial 
products compared to more traditional investment 
products. In 2020 we saw an increase in the amount of ESG 
ETFs and ETPs, including ESG products focused on clean/
alternative energy investments. As a leading liquidity 
provider in ETPs globally, Flow Traders naturally trades 
ESG-related products with its counterparties. For example, 
in 2021 we traded €26.9 billion off-exchange in more than 
490 different ESG and SRI ETPs in Europe alone.
Our role is to enable trading in widely diversified investment 
products to anyone at any time, allowing end-investors to 
invest with lower costs and thus produce potentially higher 
returns. As a result of the efforts of liquidity providers such 
as ourselves, over the years trading costs have dropped 
dramatically and access to transparent and inexpensive 
investment products for anyone has never been more open 
or efficient. This benefits institutional investors, individual 
investors and, ultimately, society at large by creating a more 
open and accessible financial market.
This role was never more important than during the 
exceptional and extraordinary market circumstances 
evident in late March and early April 2020 when Flow Traders 
was able to continuously provide liquidity and pricing to the 
ETP markets on a global basis. End-investors, issuers and 
counterparties have been reassured by our continuous 
notably social rights, freedom of association and equality, 
abolishment of forced and child labour. An example of our 
business integrity can be seen in the fact we have zero 
tolerance towards bribery and corruption and we actively 
ensure that no such behavior occurs. No cases of bribery or 
corruption were reported in 2021. Continuous training of staff 
as well as robust risk and compliance controls contribute to 
the business integrity of Flow Traders.

Liquidity in financial markets
As a liquidity provider we are active on global financial 
markets and we contribute to transparency in the pricing 
process, enabling market participants to invest at fair prices 
and lower costs. We enable thousands of exchange-traded

Business integrity
At Flow Traders, business integrity means conducting 
business within a framework of laws and regulations, to high 
ethical standards, and in accordance with our own policies 
and procedures. We also have a great respect for human 
rights in every jurisdiction where we operate. Moreover, 
Flow Traders operates in an industry where the risk of 
modern slavery and human trafficking is inherently low and 
in jurisdictions where labour standards are high. Nonetheless, 
we have applied to become a signatory to the United Nations 
Global Compact. Flow Traders’ complies with these

a culture that encourages innovation, entrepreneurialism 
and risk-awareness, while focusing on drive, teamwork and 
ownership. By developing talent in-house and maintaining 
a committed and substantial employee shareholder base,

Diversity and inclusion
Flow Traders is a multinational company with offices across 
the globe. This naturally creates an environment where 
people of diverse cultures and backgrounds collaborate and 
drive our organization forward, excel every day, and perform 
at the highest level possible. We believe that a diverse 
workforce, which has open communication channels and the 
freedom to collaborate and introduce best practices, helps 
create a richer variety of ideas and can better develop 
solutions to the challenges we face. 
We have a long-standing policy of recruiting and retaining 
the best talent available and aim to provide an inclusive 
working environment regardless of the gender, ethnicity, 
faith or sexual orientation of our employees. We are 
committed to providing equal employment opportunities to 
all qualified job applicants. As a result, we employ people 
from 53 nationalities across our offices. The composition of 
our workforce tracks the outflow of the education system in 
the various roles we offer. We strongly encourage women to 
apply for any function within the firm, particularly when they 
have a background in fields that traditionally have a higher 
proportion of male employees. This is supported by our 
Equal Opportunity Policy (please refer to the chapter Our 
governance for further information). 
We are committed to being a truly equal opportunity 
employer, by recruiting, retaining and promoting people 
based on merit, and merit alone. This also holds for our 
Management Board and Supervisory Board and we were 
presence when markets were under pressure which has 
enabled them to trade in all circumstances and when 
liquidity is most sought after.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager and do 
not have our own Assets under Management (AuM). We also 
do not develop or make products, do not provide any 
services and do not have (consumer) clients. Our value chain 
comprises, among others, of our institutional 
counterparties, prime brokers and regulators.
3.	
Good corporate governance
We operate a two-tier governance structure, consisting of 
a Management Board and a Supervisory Board. 
The Management Board is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the company, formulating strategies and 
policies, and setting and achieving our objectives. 
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the 
Management Board. Each board is accountable to the 
General Meeting for the performance of its duties.
Our governance is reflected in our internal rules and 
regulations, including our Articles of Association, 
Management Board By-Laws, Supervisory Board By-Laws, 
the Terms of Reference of our Supervisory Board 
committees and our Code of Conduct. These, together with 
our policies, can be found on our website. 
Flow Traders remains focused on long-term value creation, 
culture and risk management while balancing the interests 
of our many stakeholders, such as shareholders, senior 
management executives, counterparties, suppliers, 
investors, employees, regulators and the community. 
When making decisions, both boards carefully weighs the 
interest of all these stakeholders in relation to our company

tournaments in Amsterdam, Australia and New York, chess 
tournaments in Amsterdam, and trading competitions in 
select universities in Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong 
and Singapore.
As a technology enabled firm, we facilitate opportunities for 
young talent in technology. In 2021 we continued to invest in 
the Graduate Software Development program, which will 
enhance the experience of new graduates joining the 
company in 2022. The program was designed for ambitious, 
skilled and creative graduates who like to be challenged 
every day and who strive to make visible contributions to the 
further growth of our business. Successful applicants join 
the company’s development teams for one year to work on 
a variety of projects. One of the goals is to improve the 
proprietary technology platform that enables Flow Traders 
to trade on exchanges worldwide. The projects cover 
multiple areas of our technology landscape. After 
completing their project, participants present their results to 
a jury, led by senior members of the Technology 
department. Throughout the program, graduates receive 
continuous support from dedicated mentors, not only in the 
field of technology, but also in the area of personal 
development.
Graduate Software Developers are typically recruited 
straight from university, having Computer Science or 
Engineering-related educational backgrounds. All graduates 
share a strong interest in either C++ or Java, which is why 
a coding test is an important part of the selection procedure. 
To experience development at Flow Traders first hand, 
we invite an exclusive group of students to our technology 
event CODE@FLOW in our Amsterdam office. The two-day 
challenge gives participants an opportunity to engage in 
our business, and society. This is reflected in a low 
absenteeism rate of 1.51% globally in 2021 (2020: 0.90%).
Our offices are all growing, and we look to hire as many 
qualified applicants as we can find. However, our selection 
standards remain high – our candidates need to go through 
a number of tests and interviews, with less than 1 percent of 
applicants for trading positions ultimately receiving a job 
offer. To find people with the unique skill sets needed for 
a global liquidity provider we recruit across the globe, 
advertising and searching across multiple platforms. We also 
visit campuses in India, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, 
the US, and across Europe, meeting talents in career fairs and 
workshops. This year, due to the pandemic and the resulting 
restraints, we have moved the bulk of our recruitment 
efforts online. We still recruit for all disciplines and look for 
the best caliber available, regardless of their gender, age, 
ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. To take an unbiased 
decision, in our recruitment process for certain events, 
certain data, including names and gender, is blacked out.
Graduate traders are typically recruited straight from 
university. Although our traders have a varied educational 
background, they share a strong numerical aptitude, which is 
why a numerical test is an important part of the selection 
procedure. To experience the world of trading first hand, 
we invite a select group of students to our Business Courses 
in our Amsterdam and New York offices. The two-day event 
is packed with interesting and challenging trading exercises 
and simulations and includes quantitative and technical 
cases to mirror the evolving nature of the role. In a similar 
fashion, we host the Flow Traders Arbitrage Challenge case 
competition in Singapore and Hong Kong. We also host 
numerous informal events such as the annual poker 
“To experience the 
world of trading

We are a fast growing company, which creates good jobs 
across a variety of departments. In 2021 we welcomed 165 
new hires (2020: 138), resulting in a 11 percent increase in the 
number of FTEs year-on-year. Our new colleagues join us 
from all parts of the world. To make sure they feel at home 
quickly we offer full relocation support for everyone moving 
to our offices from abroad. We help with finding a home, 
applying for a visa and getting to know the local culture. 
We also offer our international employees based in 
high-tech discussions and technical cases with our 
specialists in software development and trading, followed 
by a competitive hackathon.
In 2021 we continued hosting, participating in, 
and sponsoring a variety of events, ranging from in-house 
days to a special event for women who are curious about 
a career in the trading industry to various meet ups. With the 
opening of our new London branch in 2018, we have 
structurally increased our presence at the relevant 
universities in the UK and held multiple recruitment 
campaigns. 
All our offices are designed to provide a pleasant and 
ergonomically sound place to work. They are flooded with 
light, have attractive, well laid out interiors and 
ergonomically-optimized furniture. In addition, to give our 
people the opportunity to perform at their best, we offer 
healthy breakfast and lunch options, have our own bar in 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong, New York and Singapore, 
and organize great company trips and parties. 
In Amsterdam, we also have our own in-house gym facilities 
and an in-house barber in New York. We not only use our 
newly-designed bars for after work gatherings, but also for 
recruiting events and quarterly staff updates. We believe 
these benefits are important to maintain a healthy and 
happy workforce and to stimulate bonding and connections 
beyond employees’ direct circle of colleagues, helping to 
encourage teamwork across the whole company. This year, 
as was the case in 2020, these workplace related benefits 
could not be enjoyed to the fullest as a large portion of our 
staff was working from home due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Therefore, we invested in people’s home office 
environments by granting a budget for buying equipment 
and offering other support measures to staff.
Amsterdam the opportunity to attend Dutch language 
classes. This year specifically, we had to onboard a large part 
of our new hires online, as we were limiting presence in the 
offices by having the majority of our staff working from home 
for a prolonged period of time, to help reduce the spread of 
COVID-19.

for their own personal development. In 2021, we further 
expanded the available offerings, with mainly online training 
session formats. 
In total, employees undertook 13,413 training hours during 
the course of 2021 which comprised external training, 
mandatory training and onboarding (general and 
technology).
Many of our managers are ‘home-grown’, having developed 
into their positions after a number of years working with the 
company. They set an example and act as an inspiration for 
new hires, illustrating the career paths open to them. And to 
complement self-growth, we also like to give our employees 
the chance to transfer between our offices and experience 
life and work elsewhere. 
We believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and office are 
We invest in our people. For example, we provide them with 
a range of excellent training programs, benefitting them and 
the company. 
Our new hires in trading and technology start with an 
intensive introduction program, bringing them up to speed 
with our way of working and training them in the specific 
skills they need to do their job well. All junior traders – 
including those hired for our Asian and the US offices – 
begin their global training program at our offices in 
Amsterdam. 
And all new employees receive an introduction to Flow 
Traders through the Flow Academy, including online and 
on-site training that provides programs in a wide variety of 
subjects, including culture, technology, regulatory 
developments, trading for non-traders, and the 
Whistleblower Policy, including anti-corruption. Through

Fair taxation
We are committed to being good corporate citizens, bringing 
positive value to the communities we operate in. We pay 
taxes where they are due and subscribe to fair taxation in 
terms of corporate income tax. We note that taxes are not 
limited to corporate income tax but also include VAT, wages 
tax, social securities, dividend withholding tax, stamp duties 
and other transaction taxes. In 2021 we incurred total 
corporate income taxes of €30 million (2020: €107 million) 
which was 21% of our taxable income. We believe it is vital to 
operate a fair, transparent and straightforward tax policy, 
which is required when running a sustainable business and 
delivering long-term value to all our stakeholders.
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of its 
financial reporting and its relations with tax authorities 
globally. With regard to financial reporting, conservative 
accounting principles are being applied and one-offs must 
occur infrequently and be clearly documented. In the 
current rapid changing tax landscape and the associated 
various (new) tax reporting requirements, Flow Traders as 
a technology enabled liquidity provider strives to automate 
tax filing processes as much as possible. Flow Traders is 
a strong believer that by automating tax processes it 
improves the compliance quality and the insight of the 
company’s tax position.
The dialogue we have with stakeholders includes discussions 
on our financial reporting and tax policy and, as with all 
stakeholder input, is considered during our decision-making 
process. However, so far we have not seen a desire among 
stakeholders for a change to our tax policy. We support 
transparency initiatives, such as country-by-country 
reporting and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting from the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
In 2015 a group of employees bought shares in Flow Traders. 
These shares are subject to a six-year lock-up period. 
25 percent of these shares have been released on 1 June 
2018, 1 June 2019 and 1 June 2020. The last 25 percent of the

entitled to receive variable compensation relative to their 
contribution to the firm as a whole. We are transparent 
about how we pay our people and how much we pay them, 
including management. We have a Remuneration Policy that 
permits variable pay only when a profit is made. We are 
constantly looking for ways to improve our remuneration 
principles. And because variable remuneration is, to a large 
extent, deferred, it remains at risk of forfeiture if we sustain 
a loss. We believe this is the strongest incentive for 
sustainable, risk-aware behavior for all our staff. In addition, 
we promote employee shareholding through rewarding 
a significant part of variable remuneration in shares. 
This aligns the interests of the company and its shareholders 
with those of our employees by creating ‘skin in the game’. 
Shares held by employees and 
Management Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, thus aligning 
the company’s long-term success to their personal financial 
circumstances. Since IPO, we have utilized a number of share 
schemes. Around the time of the IPO, our CEO and 
a significant number of current and former employees 
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow Traders 
Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and Flow Traders Loyalty Incentive 
Plan (FLIP) were introduced. The FCIP was replaced in 2020 
by a new share plan which provides the award up to 50% of 
variable remuneration in shares (or share-like instruments).
On 31 December 2021, out of 605 active employees, 407 
(31 December 2020, 429 out of 564) employees are active 
participants of various employee share plans.

The key participants in the Tax Control Framework are well 
established and include the Supervisory Board, 
Management Board, Finance department, Tax department, 
internal auditors and external auditors. They are able to 
assess and weigh the risks associated with the tax decision 
process for our business and stakeholders. Under Flow 
Traders Tax Control Framework, significant tax positions, 
including the tax strategy, are always shared with and 
subject to the approval of the Management Board. 
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local tax legislation. We do not use tax 
haven jurisdictions for tax avoidance purposes and carry out 
our business through entities in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the company can operate its business in 
line with its belief that it is part of the corporate social 
responsibility duty to pay taxes where it operates. In addition 
to corporate income taxes, Flow Traders pays many other 
taxes, including but not limited to, payroll taxes and social 
security contributions on the wages of its employees, value 
added taxes and property taxes. All these taxes are 
a significant basis of funding governmental public services. 
It is our social responsibility to contribute through taxes in 
the regions we operate in.  For more information on our tax 
position, please refer to note 11 of the financial statements.
7.	
Societal commitments and charities
At Flow Traders, we believe it is important for us to back 
initiatives that contribute to society. We’ve done so for many 
years – through the firm and through our colleagues’ 
personal efforts. We support a number of charities, not only 
financially but also by offering access to our knowledge and 
experience. Our people are enthusiastic about supporting 
charitable initiatives, which has always been part of our 
(OECD), and frequently assess the impact of such initiatives. 
We also closely monitor the reporting thresholds under the 
country-by-country reporting rules, to ensure that we meet 
our reporting obligations when we fall under the scope of 
this rule. Where necessary or relevant, we take the 
appropriate actions to adopt these initiatives in our tax 
control framework. Further details on our tax policy can be 
found under Tax Principles on our website. The tax principles 
also serve as KPIs throughout our performance 
measurement. The tax function within the company will 
therefore provide appropriate input as part of the approval 
process for business proposals to ensure a clear 
understanding of the tax consequences. 
We have good standing relationships with the tax authorities 
in each region in which we operate. We proactively manage 
our relationship with the tax authorities with the aim of 
minimizing the risk of challenge, dispute or damage that 
could have an impact on our credibility. We concluded 
a horizontal supervision agreement with the Dutch Tax 
Authority (horizontaal toezicht) with a view to further 
strengthening our transparent and professional relationship 
with the tax authorities. Tax laws, rules and interpretations 
are continuously subject to a changing social view towards 
tax and we cannot be certain of continued benefit from 
certain tax regimes, such as the innovation box regime in the 
Netherlands. Given the complexity of the continuously 
changing tax legislation, and the fact that this may create 
uncertainty for Flow Traders, we obtain independent 
external tax advice through reputable tax firms or, 
when appropriate, approval is obtained from tax authorities 
on specific material or complex tax matters.

Stakeholder engagement
Flow Traders operates in one of the most regulated and 
competitive markets and in an innovative industry. In the era 
in which we find ourselves today, business, politics and 
society merge almost seamlessly together. 
New opportunities, challenges and regulatory change are 
always on the horizon as the industry continues to innovate. 
To be able to take our corporate responsibility agenda to the 
next level, we engage with our stakeholders on a regular 
basis to understand whether we have a mutual vision on 
business developments and essential reforms in our 
regulatory environment. We consistently carry out 
materiality assessments to categorize topics that may affect 
our business operations and that could inform our strategy, 
targets and reporting.
Commitment
We commit to continuously providing liquidity to secure 
global financial markets which are essential for real 
economic growth and create value for all people. We always 
enter the public debate with full transparency, substantiate 
our long-term vision with data-driven arguments and 
identify viable improvements for the financial markets. 
Our contributions to the regulatory and legislative dialogue 
are typically made public and we are always willing to 
discuss our position and the interests we take into account. 
In 2021, one of the main issues we addressed in our 
engagement with regulators marked the capital 
requirement regime for investment firms. Aligned with this 
issue we campaigned along with industry peers an 
allocation of €430,000 from the 2021 variable remuneration 
pool.
This funding allowed the Foundation to commence fulfilling 
its aim of promoting and funding health and well-being 
charities globally. At the Flow Traders Foundation, there will 
be a pursuit of making things better by tackling problems 
through supporting highly transparent and cost-effective 
causes that improve people’s lives. The strategy of the 
Foundation is based on the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal 1 - No Poverty. In 2021 the focus within 
this strategy was Education in the light of fighting Poverty. 
This resulted in annual donations to several projects which 
supported and stimulated Education for people in poverty. 
The charities and projects of the Flow Traders Foundation 
are divided in 3 different categories:
1.	
Ad-hoc
2.	
One - year (based on the annual theme, 
Education in 2021)
3.	
Long term (3 years)
Based on the categories and the annual theme of 2021 we 
supported 40 different charities/ projects across the globe. 
Next to this we continued our support for the long term 
projects from 2020 such as SINA, JINC and Tiny Miracles. 
Some of the charitable organizations supported by the 
Foundation in 2021:
	
◾
Free a Girl
	
◾
Hack your Future
	
◾
War Child
	
◾
Flor Ayuda
	
◾
UNHCR
	
◾
IIMPACT
	
◾
Feeding America Bank
working culture. We do this by supporting Flow Traders 
employees in fundraising activities by giving time or access 
to our network.
Once again, instead of the usual holiday gifts, the 
Institutional Trading team in EMEA asked counterparties to 
select a shortlisted charity for a €50 donation to be made. 
Ultimately, 210 selections were made and donations were 
made to charities including The Ocean Cleanup, Free a girl, 
Flow Traders Foundation, the International Red Cross and 
Caritas.
To continue giving to our communities in a more structured 
manner, in 2020 we established the Flow Traders Foundation 
(the Foundation). In 2021 we continued to support several 
global charities and projects. Given the Flow Traders 
Foundation was established in 2020, we could build on the 
set structure in 2020 but of course we also improved as an 
organization.
The Board of the Foundation (Sjoerd Rietberg, former 
Co-CEO of Flow Traders) kept his role as first Chairman. 
Also the roles of Jan van Kuijk (treasurer) and Roger 
Hodenius (secretary) remained the same.
Flow Traders itself donated €10.0 million – mostly consisting 
of Flow Traders shares – to the Foundation in 2020. In the 
year 2021, these shares yielded €873.000 in the form of 
dividends for the benefit of the Foundation. The two 
founders as well as members of the Management Board, 
employees and former employees have committed to 
provide further funding, adding up to a total contribution of 
€3.25 million which will be received over a period of five 
years. In addition, the Foundation has received €500.000, 
in cash from Flow Traders N.V. and will receive an additional

Carbon emissions, material use and waste
Flow Traders considers its overall direct impact on the 
environment to be low. Due to the nature of our business, 
Flow Traders has a relatively light carbon footprint in relation 
to its direct activities. We promote public transport by 
having conveniently located offices and by not offering 
lease cars as well as where possible using 
video-conferencing to limit travel. 
Nevertheless, conscious of the challenges linked to climate 
change, the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
to manage natural resources prudently and sparingly, 
Flow Traders has sought to integrate environmental issues 
into its activities and strategy. In this context, Flow Traders 
carried out an analysis for the first time of its carbon 
footprint in 2020 which serves as the baseline. Flow Traders 
will focus in the coming years on reducing its carbon 
footprint. In the meantime, during 2020 Flow Traders 
became a Carbon-Neutral company for our own operations, 
committing to zero emissions by offsetting our entire 
carbon footprint. By measuring, mitigating and offsetting 
our remaining carbon footprint, we aim to do our part in 
tackling global climate change, while supporting sustainable 
development in local communities.
keen to address pressing issues, demonstrates our positive 
impact to society and ultimately improve our business. 
As part of our collaborative strategy, we are participating in 
the board of the Dutch Association of Proprietary Traders 
(APT) and the Executive Committee of the European 
Proprietary Traders Association (FIA-EPTA). In both trade 
associations we have representation on several committees 
regarding market structure, prudential regulation, digital 
assets and DeFi, sustainable finance and ESG, diversity and 
well-being. Flow Traders is also a member of the 
International Capital Markets Association (ICMA), Holland 
Fintech and participates in several other professional 
networks.
Our Management Board engages with shareholders, 
prospective investors and other stakeholders throughout 
the year and had 205 engagement meetings in 2021 either 
one-on-one, in market intelligence meetings or at a (virtual) 
conference. Notably, the Supervisory Board also engaged 
with shareholders, proxy agencies and governance bodies 
regarding the remuneration policy for the Management 
Board, ESG and corporate governance developments. 
In addition, our employees contribute to our engagement 
efforts. Together, as a team, we serve society by improving 
financial markets, supporting innovation and inspiring 
people.
alternative proposal on capital requirements related to 
digital assets. As a consequence the Basel Committee is now 
considering a new requirement. Besides the onerous 
changes in capital requirements and thresholds, the IFR/IFD 
implementation also impacted other internal policies which 
were discussed with the national competent authorities. 
These encounters and pending issues demonstrate that the 
review process of IFR/IFD starting in 2023, will be 
detrimental in creating a viable and competitive European 
regulatory framework that supports innovation and enables 
imminent developments regarding digital assets and 
decentralized finance. 
Furthermore, 2021 was characterized by intensifying 
proactive work to position Flow Traders in the discussions 
regarding the MiFIR Review, assessing the impact of the 
Digital Resilience package (DORA), the new EU Markets in 
Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules and responding to the UK 
Wholesale Markets Review. The MiFIR review includes some 
important topics for proprietary trading firms like the 
consolidated tape and a ban on payment for order flow 
(PFOF). We have reconfirmed our position to robust market 
transparency and believe PFOF has a negative effect on 
efficient price discovery and harms investors in the long run. 
Collaboration
As part of our regulatory strategy and agenda, we 
collaborate with other market participants, governments, 
regulators, interest groups and trade associations to align on 
key issues impacting the industry we operate in. Flow Traders 
also through all its activities continuously strives for fair, 
transparent and efficient financial markets. One of the key 
pillars of this strategy is to establish open dialogue with our 
stakeholders, responding to their views and concerns to be 
able to balance competing expectations. We are always

Our culture and values
We have always believed that creating a strong and 
successful business requires a set of shared values that 
everyone can rally around. Values that help shape how 
everyone behaves, feels and develops at work. We live by 
our values every day - they are at the core of what we do:
	
◾
We make investing cheaper, fairer and more efficient 
for end-investors
	
◾
We support markets with liquidity provision under all 
circumstances
	
◾
We promote fair, transparent and orderly markets
	
◾
We promote competition on a level playing field
	
◾
We comply with all rules and regulations
	
◾
We subscribe to fair taxation and transparent reporting
	
◾
We are open, informal and diverse
	
◾
We want colleagues to take ownership, 
be entrepreneurial and be team players
	
◾
We reward responsibility, performance and initiatives 
that benefit the firm as a whole
	
◾
We always give back to society and the communities we 
live in
These values are a reflection of the things we believe in. 
And they shape our culture. We believe that how you 
perform is more important than what you wear. So our 
employees dress comfortably for work – jeans, t-shirts and 
sneakers are common. We believe that what someone says 
is more important than who says it. We believe that the 
contributions of our team-members are crucial to the 
success of the company. We believe that two people know 
more than one, and that people can have great ideas even in 
areas different to their core expertise. Which is why we 
welcome and encourage everyone to share their opinions. 
Flow Traders’ primary GHG emissions arise from energy use 
in its offices and data centers, from staff travel, 
and indirectly from its supply chain (Scope 3). Flow Traders 
has a direct grasp only on Scope 1 and 2, which represent 
only 66% of the complete GHG emissions. For scope 3, 
we will need to initiate a dialogue with our entire value chain 
(upstream and downstream) to act on the bulk of these 
emissions.
In addition, for several years, Flow Traders has taken care to 
reduce its consumption of paper and water in its offices and 
data centers as well as reduce its waste to minimize its 
ecological footprint. We have stopped using single-use 
water bottles and provided employees with reusable water 
bottles. This has limited the plastic waste within the 
company significantly. When refurbishing our offices, 
we sought to use more environmentally friendly solutions 
for lighting and water consumption. We also offer a full 
lunch to all our employees, healthy and free of charge. 
We work to limit our food waste as much as possible by 
responsible purchasing of ingredients and making sure 
leftovers are consumed the next day.
Flow Traders reports its scope 1 & 2 emissions via the 
operational control approach. Scope 2 represents 
market-based emissions from electricity. For more 
information please refer to our Carbon footprint report, 
which can be requested from Investor Relations. 
Flow Traders’ carbon footprint is equivalent to 1,287 tons 
CO2eq (2020: 960 tons CO2eq) that may be split as following:
	
◾
scope 1 = 122 tons CO2eq representing 9% 
of Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint,  which are 
direct emissions from buildings;
	
◾
scope 2 = 511 tons CO2eq representing 40% 
of Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint, which 
comprise. electricity consumption from buildings;
	
◾
scope 3 = 655 tons CO2eq representing 51% 
of Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint, which 
currently calculated through business flights and the 
use of servers but exclude our strategic investments 
which have additional carbon footprints.

Anyone with a good idea, in their own area of expertise or 
another, is encouraged to share. This is part of the open, 
informal and diverse culture that makes us who we truly are.
Nurturing our culture
Maintaining, preserving and nurturing our culture is 
extremely important to everyone across the organization. 
This is done by the Management Board through the 
organization of firm-wide events and company outings as 
well regular all-staff updates. Colleagues themselves also 
reinforce the strength of our culture by organizing their own 
events, competitions and charitable endeavors.
Outstanding behavior in 2021
There have been many individual examples of outstanding 
behavior which has reinforced Flow Traders’ strong culture. 
An example which is worth highlighting - various colleagues 
continue to give up their valuable spare time to assist with 
the ongoing operation of the Flow Traders Foundation.

Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations (UN) has identified 17 SDGs that are 
designed to help bring peace and prosperity for people and 
the planet as we work collectively towards the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development. In 2020 we performed 
a materiality analysis to identify our ESG priorities. Based on 
these ESG priorities we analyzed the SDGs on subtarget 
level, to identify the three SDGs we (can) have an impact on. 
In 2022 we will be developing our ESG strategy to steer 
towards more positive impact on these SDGs.

Capital management
The Management Board’s policy is to maintain a strong 
capital base well above the required margins in order to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and 
to sustain future development of the business. The
Management Board monitors the return on capital as well as 
the level of dividends to shareholders while complying with 
prime broker and regulatory capital requirements.
The available capital in the trading companies is monitored 
on a daily basis to ensure that requirements are met at all 
times and sufficient capital is available to support the 
Group’s strategy.
Capital requirements
The Group needs to comply with capital requirements from 
its prime brokers, as well as regulatory capital requirements. 
Capital is being managed by the Group in order to maintain 
net liquidity (which represents the value of our trading 
positions, principally long and short positions in equity 
securities, plus cash and cash equivalents) in excess of our 
various capital requirements at all times, while 
simultaneously exceed the regulatory capital requirements.
Prime broker capital requirements
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain certain 
minimum capital levels. Prime brokers use various internal 
systems to calculate required capital amounts (e.g., the 
‘internal haircut model’ and the ‘margin based approach 
model’, both intending to ensure sufficient levels of risk 
allowances) and have different limits structure, pre-funding 
possibilities and cut-off times for wiring capital.

Outlook
Our aim is to continue to look for ways to strengthen our 
ESG focus and associated disclosure. With this in mind, 
we will seek to develop a full ESG and sustainability strategy. 
This will include alignment with GRI as well as setting targets 
and associated KPIs. We will also develop and adopt specific 
policies, including human rights policy, environmental policy 
and supply chain policy. Given the EU Taxonomy is relatively 
new and contains some significant uncertainties around 
specific implementation, Flow Traders will continue to 
assess the eligibility and the extent of the Taxonomy 
alignment during the course of 2022. Accordingly, this may 
impact the way in which Flow Traders addresses EU 
Taxonomy reporting in 2022.
Going concern
Flow Traders, having made appropriate enquiries, consider 
that adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, 
therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the 2021 financial statements. In reaching these 
conclusions, the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 
2021 and the strong free cash flow of the Group, the Group’s 
ability to access capital markets and the principal risks 
facing the Group are taken into consideration. 
A commentary on the Group’s cash flows, financial position 
and liquidity for the year ended 31 December 2021 is set out 
on pages 82 to 122. The Group’s capital position is strong and 
therefore the Management Board believes that Flow Traders 
is well prepared for the future.

All available capital is CET1, the quality highest capital, 
reflecting equity and retained earnings. In addition, as set 
out in the chapter Remuneration, part of our variable 
remuneration is fully discretionary and deferred over 
multiple instalments. If the company faces operational 
losses these variable compensation elements are reduced 
or forfeited entirely to cover for such loss. Although this is 
an important additional capital buffer, this is not reflected in 
the regulatory capital calculations above. 
Our Pillar III disclosures pursuant to CRR and IFR/IFD  can be

trading entity, Flow Traders B.V., have been approved and

capital requirements and Flow Traders Hong Kong Limited 
has a capital requirement in Hong Kong. Failure to comply 
with regulatory capital requirements could result in 
sanctions, including citations, fines, limits to our trading and 
revocation of a regulatory license. 
From 31 March 2018 until 25 June 2021, the company met the 
regulatory requirements of the EU Capital Requirement 
Regulation (CRR), which prescribes capital and reporting 
requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are 
supervised by the Dutch Central Bank in respect of Flow 
Traders B.V. and the company. As of 26 June 2021, the EU’s 
new Investment Firm Regulation and Directive (IFR/IFD) has 
applied to Flow Traders and is implemented and supervised 
by the Dutch Central Bank.
The aggregate capital that the prime brokers require is 
significantly higher than their risk exposure. For example, 
we may clear two legs of one transaction through two 
different prime brokers. Even when the transaction is fully 
hedged (the risk is fully offset), each prime broker will still 
require capital for such position as if the risk is not being 
offset. The prime brokers cannot establish that the other 
prime broker has an offsetting position so they will charge 
a full capital requirement. This increases the capital they 
require us to maintain beyond what would be necessary. 
In addition, margin requirements of prime brokers are 
conservatively determined by the sophistication of their 
models and the regulatory requirements, which might not 
necessarily be efficient in respect of our business model and 
trading portfolios.

Management and control
Our global capital position is managed on a daily and 
intra-day level by the Risk and Mid-Office department. 
The Risk and Mid-Office department checks our positions 
and capital posted at every prime broker for correctness and 
compares these numbers with the relevant prime broker or 
regulatory requirements. Separately, the Finance 
department prepares a rolling 15-month forecast for our 
capital positions, every month. 
As part of our regulatory capital management cycle, the Risk 
and Mid-Office departments prepare a daily report that 
shows all the group’s positions and capital versus the 
regulatory capital requirements. At the end of every quarter 
the company and Flow Traders B.V. report their capital 
requirements and corresponding coverage to the Dutch 
Central Bank. 
A final part of the internal risk management and capital 
cycle is the annual Internal Capital and Liquidity Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICLAAP). The ICLAAP comprises 
a review of prevalent risks, the capital management 
processes, the risk management framework and an 
assessment of capital adequacy and liquidity and is reported 
to the Dutch Central Bank annually. The Dutch Central Bank 
assesses the capital adequacy based on this report.

The RMF helps us to ensure sufficient internal control and 
(internal) capital through a consistent, continuous and 
careful method for addressing, managing and prioritizing 
our key risks in the context of our enterprise-wide strategic 
objectives.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify and 
document potential risks which are inherent to trading in an 
automated environment. In the very dynamic environment 
of automated trading we designed our RMF in such a way 
that it is robust, efficient and transparent. In the figure 
below we summarize our stakeholders to which we are 
obliged to deliver such a framework.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management Framework 
(RMF) forms the foundation of our approach to 
managing risks. The RMF is documented in Flow 
Traders’ Risk Management Policy and is reviewed 
annually by our Management Board.

Risk category
Context
BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC RISKS
Strategic risk
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of Flow Traders’s business plan, from strategic changes in the 
business environment, and/or from adverse strategic business decisions. Market activity risk is part of this 
risk as our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, 
in the financial instruments in which we trade.
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or 
products. Concentration risk also includes supplier dependency risks.
Project risk
The risk of inaccurate project management leading to inadequate realization of project objectives.
COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS RISKS
External fraud
Acts intended to defraud, misappropriate assets, deceive or circumvent regulations or the law, attempted 
or perpetrated against the entity by a party without a direct relationship to the entity, without the 
involvement of an employee or affiliate of the entity.
Internal fraud
Acts intended to defraud, misappropriate assets, deceive or circumvent regulations, the law or company 
policies, attempted or perpetrated against the entity by an internal party, including instances where an 
employee or affiliate is acting in collusion with external parties.
Conduct
Failure to act in accordance with internal and external stakeholders’ and society's best interests, fair 
market practices, and codes of conduct.
Financial crime
The risk of money laundering, sanctions violations, bribery and corruption, and Know Your Customer (KYC) 
failure.
Regulatory compliance 
risk
Failure to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations that are not captured through other risks.
Reputation risk
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Capital and Liquidity 
risk
The risk the entity is not able to cover the cumulative net cash outflow or available capital (e.g. needed 
trading capital or regulatory capital) over a certain period. 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market prices; in particular, changes in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. ESG risks are also having an 
increasing impact here.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in trading in or issuing a financial 
instrument defaulting on an obligation. ESG risks are also having an increasing impact here.
Enterprise Risk Management
We aim for a good balance between our business activities, 
return on capital and related risks. Flow Traders’ Risk 
Management adopts its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
approach to ensure that our risk appetite and profile are 
integrated in our day-to-day operations and strategic, 
tactical and operational objective setting and decision 
making. 
Every year, our Management Board derives its business 
targets after determining its strategic goals. Based on these 
targets and objectives, the Management Board formulates 
its risk appetite. The targets, objectives and risk appetite 
give direction to the various departments within the 
company and are used to derive our strategic risks. 
We implement our Risk Management cycle to ensure that 
the residual risk profile is (and remains) in line with the set 
risk appetite. In order to achieve this, we perform risk control 
self-assessments (RCSA) to assess current risks and identify 
risks that have newly arisen. Following the RCSAs, 
the Management Board decides on the appropriate risk 
response.
Risk categories
We identify three general risk categories - Strategic risks, 
Operational risks and Financial risks - each with their own 
specific risks areas:

Category Definition
Risk Appetite
Business and strategic risk
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of Flow Trader’s business 
plan, from strategic changes in the business environment, 
and/or from adverse strategic business decisions.
Flow Traders is prepared to take risk in a responsible way which: (i) takes our stakeholders’ interests 
into account and (ii) is consistent with our business objectives. 
Compliance and ethics risk
Compliance risk lies in Flow Traders’s potential exposure to 
legal fines, financial penalties and substantial loss, resulting 
from its failure to act according to industry laws and 
regulations, internal policies or industry best practices. Ethics 
risk refers to dealing with the negative consequence of acting 
unethically.
Considering the advance notice regulated firms get from their regulators about new regulations, 
Flow Traders has a low risk appetite to this risk since our Compliance department keeps abreast on 
an ongoing basis with the latest regulations and ensure we are compliant on Day One.
We hold ourselves, as well as our employees, responsible for acting with honesty, integrity and 
respect, including complying with our Code of Conduct, applicable laws and regulations everywhere 
we do business.
Financial risk
Risk relating to positions in our Trading Book, including risks 
primarily related to Market Risk, Liquidity Risk and Credit Risk.
The firm manages Financial risk carefully by applying a strict set of criteria in its dealings with 
counterparties, issuers and other relevant financial institutions. In addition we manage our financial 
positions through sound risk management principles.
Operational risk
The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events. This 
definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and 
reputational risk.
Flow Traders is inevitably exposed to Operational Risk, as a result of conducting its business 
operations at operational, tactical and strategic levels. The firm does not aim to completely 
eliminate this risk as this would significantly impair its ability to achieve its business objectives.
Technology risk
Risk to technology or data or applications that negatively 
impact Flow Traders’ operations.
About 40% of our employees work in our Technology Department. Technology is the backbone of 
Flow Traders and lies in one of its main competitive advantages. As a result, our risk appetite is 
moderate due to the complexity and intricacies of the trading venues we trade at. But we do spend 
a lot of time and effort to mitigate this risk to a minimum.

Risk Management Governance 
The effectiveness of risk management is unavoidably linked 
to commitment and integrity. It is therefore crucial that the 
Management Board, the global and local department heads, 
and all Flow Traders employees are aware of the company’s 
risk exposure and their own responsibilities in managing it 
efficiently.
Our risk management is embedded in the organization in line 
with the three lines model.
The first line of defense is formed by Trading, Technology 
and Operations. These departments are critical for the core 
processes within Flow Traders and are responsible for 
incorporating preventive and detective controls in the day to 
day trading and IT processes and for the continuous 
monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and trading controls.
The second line of defense is responsible for oversight and 
monitoring of risks, rules and requirements. 
Risk Management, Compliance and Finance manage risks 
through a combination of preventive and detective controls. 
Together they are responsible for the continuous risk 
management of Flow Traders.
The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’ Internal 
Audit Function (IAF). They provide independent and objective 
assurance and advice on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
governance, risk management and control systems. 
It achieves this through the competent application of 
systematic and disciplined processes, expertise, and insight. 
It reports its findings to management and the governing 
body to promote and facilitate continuous improvement. 
The IAF carries out its audit work in accordance with the 
approved and implemented Group Internal Audit Charter.

Every year the Management Board sets its business targets 
following the strategic goals. The strategic goals are 
generally formulated in November/December. 
The Supervisory Board, together with the Management 
Board, approves the strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Supervisory Board is involved in the 
strategy setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are then 
translated into annual companywide, departmental and 
individual goals and discussed in an annual meeting with the 
Management Board and all Managing Directors.
Based on the targets and objectives, the Management Board 
formulates the risk appetite of the company. The targets, 
objectives and risk appetite give direction to the various 
departments within Flow Traders and are used to derive the 
company’s strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management cycle is implemented to 
ensure that the net risk profile is and stays in line with the 
set risk appetite. To do so, we perform Risk Self 
Assessments to identify and assess current and newly arisen 
risks. Following the Risk Self Assessments, department 
heads in cooperation with the Management Board will 
decide on the appropriate risk response. The effects of the 
chosen risk responses will be monitored and every year the 
actual net risk profile will be mapped versus the appetite.
Risk reporting
We have a standing Risk Committee that continuously 
assesses the risks we face in our business, and is composed 
of our Global Head of Risk and the Management Board. 
Aside from ongoing ad-hoc communication, there is 
a monthly meeting set up in which they discuss all risk 
assessments and risk proposals related to position limits, 
The annual risk management cycle follows the below risk management framework:

that we are not too dependent on the levels of market 
activity in one asset class or product category. 
Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or 
external events. Operational risk management is an integral 
part of Flow Traders’ risk and control systems. As our 
operational risks are concentrated in technology related 
events at exchanges and clearing members, our investment 
in technology is important to mitigate those associated risks. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, 
high-performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new hardware 
and software. Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement improvements in 
both hardware and software on an ongoing basis. Controlled 
releases of hardware and software enhancements provide 
for minimal disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or updates 
of our trading software) is being developed is strictly 
separated from the environment in which such trading 
software operates in production. Access to the source code 
is strictly controlled and limited. Prior to releasing our 
trading software, or an update into the production 
environment, any element of our trading software is 
subjected to a review of its code, testing in an environment 
that is separate from our production environment, validation 
in limited production (processing a strictly limited number of 
trades) on one trading desk in respect of trading a single 
financial instrument, followed by more extensive testing 
across multiple desks and/or trading multiple financial 
instruments. Each step is appropriately documented. 
the Corporate Governance Code have been discussed by the 
Supervisory Board, as all members of the Supervisory Board 
are members of the Risk Committee. For more information, 
please refer to the chapter Report of the Supervisory Board.
Key risks
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from unfavorable 
market movements in various drivers of a security’s price 
that may result in a financial loss for its holder. For 
illustration, the value of a financial instrument may fluctuate 
because of changes in factors such as equity prices, currency 
rates, future dividend expectations, interest rates and 
volatilities. Our hedging strategies (a combination of 
underlying securities and vanilla derivatives) along with our 
continuous monitoring of the positions aim to minimize this 
risk. Our trading philosophy is that we hedge our positions as 
perfectly as possible and therefore minimize exposures.
Market activity risk (business risk)
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of the level 
of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial 
instruments in which we trade, and the bid-ask spreads 
(which largely determine the profit on the trade, or margins, 
we capture). Trading volumes in securities, derivatives, 
currencies, commodities, digital assets and other financial 
instruments on exchanges and in other trading venues 
worldwide are directly affected by factors beyond our 
control, including economic and political conditions, broad 
trends in business and finance, regulatory requirements, 
actions by central banks, and changes in the markets in 
which such transactions occur.
To cope with periods of little market activity, we diversify 
our trading in products and markets. This is to safeguard 
strategies, procedures, capital requirements and other 
requirements from prime brokers and market 
developments. Any major changes to our risk systems, 
strategies and limit setting must subsequently be approved 
by the Management Board. 
In addition to the standing Risk Committee, the company 
has a Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. 
All members of the Supervisory Board are members of this 
Risk Committee. The Management Board informs the Risk 
Committee of the Supervisory Board about the 
effectiveness of the internal risk management and control 
systems. This includes the reasonable assurance that the 
aforementioned systems do not contain any material 
inaccuracies. In addition, the tasks of the Risk Committee of 
the Supervisory Board includes supervision and monitoring, 
as well as advising the Management Board on the operation 
of the company’s internal risk management and control 
systems. The Risk Committee is also responsible for 
providing advice to the Management Board on the 
company’s development, performance, and sustainability of 
its trading strategies, as well as reviewing the risk of the 
company. It maintains regular contact with the company’s 
Trading and Risk and Operations departments. For more 
information on the responsibilities of our Risk Committee, 
please see the chapter Our governance.
Following a review of the company’s risk assessment 
processes, the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems has been identified as 
a priority and as a joint responsibility of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees. All risks relevant to each of the 
committees of the Supervisory Board are monitored in the 
Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. This means that 
the relevant items set out in best practice provision 1.4.1 of

Our Compliance department assists management and 
operations at group and local level by identifying, advising 
on, reviewing and reporting on regulations. It also seeks to 
maintain a compliant business environment through training 
and monitoring in order to ensure and enhance the group’s 
conformance with its regulatory obligations.  
Compliance together with Public Affairs monitors and 
assesses upcoming regulations. During 2021 and 2022 this 
included amongst others: 
	
◾
The European Central Securities Depositories 
Regulation which became effective on February 1st, 
2022. The regulation introduces a new settlement 
regime for securities cleared by European central 
securities depositories. Most notably it introduces cash 
penalties for late settlement of transactions. 
Flow Traders has been preparing for this regulation 
throughout 2021, and will continue to monitor its 
impact after implementation and adapt as needed. 
	
◾
The MiFID/MiFIR review that was announced by ESMA in 
2021. The review aims to further improve the 
framework introduced by MiFID II. Flow Traders is 
engaging with regulators and various stakeholders to 
continue our push for transparency in all markets we 
are active in.
	
◾
Over the course of 2021, implementing IFR/IFD was a 
key theme for Flow Traders. We held dialogues with 
regulators, trade associations and our peers to be able 
to match the best practices in the market. These 
conversations will continue in 2022 as the final aspects 
of implementation still need to be set.     
	
◾
Digital Assets and related forthcoming regulations are 
a global phenomenon that attract a lot of attention. 
Governments and regulators are taking quite different 
approaches to this emerging and quickly developing 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we start 
trading on any new platforms, including platforms 
designated for trading digital assets. While many of these 
platforms remain unregulated, many have strongly 
improved their own onboarding procedures and 
counterparty identification procedures. While we believe our 
own procedures are strong, the unregulated status of these 
platforms and their location in emerging economies makes 
them inherently less institutionalized and supervised than 
regulated platforms in developed economies.
Regulatory risk
While we do not have clients and do not provide investment 
services or ancillary services to third parties, our markets 
and nearly all aspects of our business are heavily regulated. 
Where applicable, entities forming part of our group have 
obtained the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses. 
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in four 
international jurisdictions and with branch offices 
established in London, Milan and Paris. As a group we 
currently trade on more than 180 venues worldwide. 
In addition, we operate on various venues through brokers. 
As we have to comply with our home regulations, local 
regulations and trading rules of all venues on which we 
trade, our regulatory landscape is vast. Legislators and 
regulators worldwide strengthen their supervision within our 
environment, demanding a professional and well-structured 
compliance organization. During 2022 we plan to migrate 
the activities of our branch office in London to a new legal 
entity expected to be licensed by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”) in the UK. The authorisation process with 
the FCA is currently ongoing and we anticipate that the 
transition will be completed by the end of 2022. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control undisrupted 
trading activities in real time. Multilayer monitoring is 
employed to avoid errors. But when these occur the relevant 
teams are immediately notified via multiple notification 
channels. We rely on multiple third party service providers 
for business and market data. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with our 
proprietary technology platform, analyzing real-time pricing 
data, and is designed to ensure that our order activity is 
conducted within strict pre-determined trading and position 
limits. For example, our pre-trade risk controls are designed 
to prevent the trading engines from sending quotes which 
deviate from our pre-defined risk parameters, such as price 
and volume limits set by the Risk Management department, 
which keeps our ordering, trading and positions well within 
tolerance levels. Our monitoring tools reconcile trades, 
prices and positions against those of our exchanges and 
prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration tests 
by external experts. We have a comprehensive IT security 
system that is designed to protect us from attacks both 
from inside and outside the platform. Where we have 
a technical interface with institutions like our prime brokers 
and exchanges, the integrity of the connection between the 
systems and the data that is being exchanged is subject to 
prior conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, 
we continuously review to ensure it adequately captures 
relevant scenarios. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 
global pandemic we have made substantial changes to our 
back up site management.

manage the outcome of such inquiries, although we aim to 
be as transparent and cooperative as possible given the 
circumstances.
Information on the remuneration of the Management Board 
members and the Supervisory Board members can be found 
in the chapter Remuneration.
Environmental risk
While Flow Traders considers its overall impact on the 
environment to be low, we have nonetheless identified 
certain environmental risks to our business: 
	
◾
Physical environmental risks such as earthquakes, 
forest fi res and floods could negatively impact our 
physical infrastructure. This is particularly relevant to 
our server locations which are distributed globally. 
Climate change will likely lead an increase in extreme 
weather events in the future. We mitigate this risk by 
having a widely distributed server infrastructure high 
degree of system redundancy. In addition, recent forest 
fi res in South East Asia have led to the closure of our 
Singapore office. This was mitigated by activities 
transferring to other office ce locations.
	
◾
Regulation may affect Flow Traders financially by 
putting a price on CO2 and other greenhouse gas 
emissions, In addition, CO2 pricing may have an impact 
on how seek to offset our carbon footprint in the 
coming years.
External risk
Given the highly interconnected nature of the financial 
markets ecosystem we are a part of, we recognize that 
should any of the risks referenced within this section 
materialize, there could be a negative impact on various 
external third parties. Specifically, market and operational 
asset class. As a liquidity provider we are following 
these developments closely and are an active 
contributor to regulatory consultations. We anticipate 
the regulatory uncertainty will continue for most of 
2022. We are engaging with regulators on a global and 
local level to push for a clear regulatory framework. 
We anticipate that a clear regulatory framework will 
lead to a mature ecosystem with sustainable 
institutional growth for digital assets.  
The Compliance, Risk and Operations departments have 
promulgated and implemented risk controls, internal rules 
and regulations that were developed following regulatory 
requirements, guidelines from market authorities, industry 
best practices and our own best practices. Laws and 
regulations, including tax laws, are subject to change or can 
be interpreted differently in practice over time. 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements could adversely affect our 
reputation, profitability and prospects. This may also be the 
case for differences in interpretation or lack of timely or 
complete implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, disgorgements and 
censures, suspension or expulsion from trading venues or 
the revocation or limitation of licenses. We aim to minimize 
such risks by focusing considerable management attention, 
employing highly-qualified compliance and risk 
professionals, deploying training, monitoring and reporting 
systems, and continuously evaluating and implementing 
current and upcoming regulation on our operations. 
Notwithstanding such efforts, given the highly regulated 
nature of our business, we are regularly subject to routine 
(and sometimes more targeted) inquiries and audits from 
regulators and trading venues. It is difficult to predict or

Our assessment showed no impact to our business model 
and a very limited impact to a very few of our contracts 
which were successfully renegotiated with the concerned 
counterparties.
Compliance and transparency
Focus on anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
Flow Traders is a strong proponent of effective, efficient and 
equal regulation and contributes to the regulatory dialogue 
in our key jurisdictions as we want markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
We commit to complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations that apply to us, wherever we operate, including 
in respect of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering laws. Integrity and transparency is central to the 
way we run our business, from our Management Board and 
Supervisory Board to all our staff, regardless of their role. 
The company encourages an open culture within its 
organization and expects its employees to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations and internal policies. 
Each employee is responsible for ensuring an honest and 
ethical conduct of business within the company. We have 
issued a Code of Conduct, which forms part of our 
employment documentation. Ensuring compliance with the 
Code of Conduct is the responsibility of the Management 
Board. Any reported potential breaches are investigated 
fully by the Management Board and other members of our 
senior management team in accordance with existing clearly 
laid out procedures and policies. This Code of Conduct can 
be found on our website www.flowtraders.com.
risk events could negatively impact key parties within our 
value chain; namely counterparties and prime brokers. There 
could be a risk to our counterparties’ ability to trade with us 
or settlement trades effectively on a timely basis. Moreover, 
the various prime brokers we work closely with could also be 
exposed to risk.
IBOR Transition
Hundreds of trillions of US dollars of various types of 
financial products use Interbank offered rates (‘Ibors’) for 
pricing, risk measurement and benchmarking purposes. 
In July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) 
announced that it will discontinue administrating the London 
interbank offered rate (‘Libor’) after 2021. On 8 June 2016, 
the European Parliament and Council released Regulation 
2016/1011 on indices used as benchmarks in financial 
instruments and financial contracts to safeguard the 
accurateness, robustness and integrity of interest rate 
benchmarks. 
As a result of the scheduled termination of the London 
interbank offered rates (‘Libor’), Euro Overnight Index 
Average (‘Eonia’) and other Ibors, we conducted a thorough 
analysis of the financial (potential reduction in funding due 
to counterparties’ reluctance to transition their positions) 
and non-financial (difficulty to negotiate fallbacks with 
certain counterparties, implementation of fallback provision 
and operational impairments due to the transition) risks to 
our business model and contracts. We ensured that financial 
instruments and contracts impacted by the transition 
contained appropriate fallback language or are being 
amended through bilateral negotiation or leveraging 
industry-wide protocols.

or any reasonable suspicions. All employees are required to 
participate in an online course on the Whistleblower Policy, 
as part of the Flow Academy, to create awareness and 
guidance on how to deal with misconducts and incidents 
described in Flow Traders whistleblower policy.
 
Circumstances may arise that cause an employee to feel 
insecure or unsafe to the extent that they may not want to 
use the usual reporting lines. The company provides 
employees with a safe way of reporting suspected 
misconducts within its organization and offers adequate 
protection. The Whistleblower Policy has wide applications, 
including in respect of topics such as fraud, market abuse, 
corruption, anti-money laundering, theft, bribery, 
dishonoring Flow Traders Global tax policy and any other 
structural misconduct that threatens the integrity and 
proper business conduct of Flow Traders. The Whistleblower 
Policy provides whistleblowers with anonymity, 
confidentiality, and the company will not impose sanctions 
on disclosure (or affect an employee’s legal position) when 
the employee reports a suspected misconduct in good faith, 
unless the employee is involved in the issue that is being 
reported. We respect a non-retaliation policy when 
a suspected misconduct is reported. Flow Traders’ 
Whistleblower Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit Function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and objective 
assurance, advice, and insight. An efficient and effective 
Internal Audit Function contributes to strong internal 
controls and to a robust corporate governance structure, 
which can address significant risks. The scope of internal 
audit work includes the examination and evaluation of the 
We have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering (AML) policies in place that apply to all our staff. 
We expect our counterparties, business partners, 
intermediaries, contractors and subcontractors to adhere to 
the same standards. We believe that the risk of bribery or 
corruption is very limited as we do not hold or manage client 
money or assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain production 
facilities or source raw materials. Nevertheless, staff 
receives training in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and AML 
practices, as the Management Board underlines the 
importance of these trainings.
Key to our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy is that 
officials or counterparties may never be placed in an 
uncomfortable position. No gifts nor favors may lead (or 
have the appearance to lead) to obligations or embarrass 
any recipient, and no gifts nor favors of any substantial 
value may be given to authorities. Facilitation payments are 
not permitted. We provide clear and recurring guidance in 
that respect. As part of our constant monitoring, 
all expenses and gifts relating to external parties are 
checked by senior managers and employees must state the 
purpose and recipient of an expense.
We have zero tolerance towards bribery and corruption and 
we actively ensure that no such behavior occurs. No cases of 
bribery or corruption were reported in 2021.
Whistleblowers
In addition to our very strong culture of openness, 
transparency and participation, we also have an elaborate 
Whistleblower Policy in place for all staff and relevant 
contractors, approved by the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. Employees are free to raise issues and 
have the responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, 
adequacy and effectiveness of Flow Traders’ risk 
management, control and governance processes. Audit work 
includes also assessments of the quality of performance in 
carrying out assigned responsibilities to achieve Flow 
Traders’ stated goals and objectives. 
Our Group Internal Audit Charter defines the Internal Audit 
Function’s purpose, authority, responsibility and position 
within Flow Traders. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance provided by 
the Institute of Internal Auditors. 
The Internal Audit Function is an integral part of our 
reporting cycle. The Internal Audit Function reports to the 
Audit Committee and to the CEO. It aligns its efforts with the 
external auditor and reports its audit results to the 
Management Board, the essence of its audit results to the 
Audit Committee and informs the external auditor. 
The Management Board assesses the way in which the 
Internal Audit Function fulfils its responsibility annually and 
takes the opinion of the Audit Committee into account.

regulations, including our Articles of Association, 
Management Board By-Laws, Supervisory Board By-Laws, 
the Terms of Reference of our Supervisory Board 
committees and our Code of Conduct. These, together with 
our policies, can be found on our website. 
Flow Traders remains focused on long-term value creation, 
culture and risk management while balancing the interests

management executives, counterparties, suppliers, 
investors, employees, regulators and the community. 
Our board structure is organized as a two-tier 
governance structure, consisting of a 
Management Board (composed of 5 executive 
members) and a Supervisory Board (composed of

honor such a request provided that the request is received in 
writing at least 60 days before the date of such a meeting. 
Each shareholder is entitled – either in person or via proxy – 
to attend the AGM and to vote during the AGM. The AGM is 
the perfect place for shareholders and the Management 
Board and Supervisory Board to interact. At an AGM, 
shareholders can ask questions directly to the Management 
Board and/or the Supervisory Board. Our Management 
Board and Supervisory Board strongly encourage 
shareholders to interact. 
employees. We aim to provide an inclusive work 
environment for all employees. This also holds for our 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it comes 
to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the Management 
Board, we adhere to the same principles of equal 
opportunity as set out above. Our current Supervisory 
Board, as a result of the Equal Opportunity Policy, is diverse 
in terms of, inter alia, age, education, nationality, 
and professional backgrounds. This diverse composition 
entails constructive dialogues and shared responsibility, 
resulting in an effective and efficient Supervisory Board.

General Meeting, shares and shareholders 
Flow Traders highly encourages shareholder participation in 
the decision-making of the General Meeting. It is of great 
importance to the company that its shareholders have an 
actual say in the Annual General Meeting (AGM), and the 
company therefore encourages an open dialogue. 
Flow Traders ensures that the General Meeting is adequately 
provided with information.
Agenda items of the AGM that need to be handled as 
separate agenda items on the basis of the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Dutch Civil Code or the Articles of 
Association will be handled as such. 
Flow Traders holds an AGM within six months following the 
end of the financial year. The agenda for this meeting 
includes the adoption of the annual accounts, the content of 
the annual report covering the previous year’s financial 
business, the policy of the company on additions to reserves

“In order to align our 
employees’ interests 
with those of our 
shareholders, the 
company awards 100 
shares in the company 
to most employees 
with a tenure of over 
two years.”
Voting rights
Each share carries one vote at the AGM. Subject to certain 
exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles of 
Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed 
by an absolute majority of votes cast. Votes can be cast at 
the AGM either in person or by proxy. These proxies can be 
granted electronically or in writing to the company or to 
independent third parties, such as a civil-law notary. 
Following the prolongment of the Temporary Act COVID-19 
(Tijdelijke Wet COVID-19) and the circumstances as a result 
of the pandemic, holding a physical AGM was not feasible 
this year and votes could not be cast in person. 
Amendment to the Articles of Association
The General Meeting may pass a resolution to amend the 
Articles of Association or to wind up the company with an 
absolute majority of the votes cast. This can only be done if 
the Management Board has proposed to amend the Articles 
of Association or wind up the company. Such proposal has to 
be approved by the Supervisory Board.
When a proposal to amend the Articles of Association or to 
wind up the company is made to the General Meeting, 
the intention to propose such resolution must be stated in 
the relevant notice convening the General Meeting. If it 
concerns an amendment to the Articles of Association, 
a copy of the proposal in which the proposed amendment is 
quoted verbatim must at the same time be deposited at the 
company’s office and this copy shall be made available for 
inspection by the shareholders until the end of the General 
Meeting.
Issue of shares
Shares are issued by a decision of the Management Board. 
This decision must be approved by the Supervisory Board. 
During the 2021 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Management Board, subject to the 
Supervisory Board’s approval, to issue ordinary shares or to 
grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares up to and 
including 23 October 2022 for up to ten percent of the total 
number of shares issued at the time of the General Meeting 
for any purposes. Any issuance exceeding this limit needs 
approval by the General Meeting.
In addition, the General Meeting renewed the authority of 
the Management Board, subject to the Supervisory Board’s 
approval, to restrict or exclude applicable pre-emptive 
rights when issuing ordinary shares or granting rights to 
subscribe for ordinary shares up to and including 23 October 
2022. 
At our next AGM, scheduled to be held on 29 April 2022, 
the Management Board intends to request that the General 
Meeting renews its authorization to issue shares for up to 
ten percent of the total number of shares issued at the time 
of the AGM for any purposes.
Repurchase and purchase of shares
Shares may be repurchased by the company by a decision of 
the Management Board. This decision must be approved by 
the Supervisory Board. During the 2021 AGM, our  
shareholders renewed the authority of the Management 
Board to, subject to the Supervisory Board’s approval, 
acquire shares in the capital of the company, either through 
purchase on a stock exchange or otherwise. The authority 
applies up to and including 23 October 2022, under the 
following conditions: the repurchase (i) may constitute up to 
ten percent of the total number of shares issued at the time 
of the General Meeting; (ii) provided that the company will 
not hold more shares in stock than ten percent of the issued 
share capital; and (iii) at a price (excluding expenses) not less 
than the nominal value of the shares and not higher than the 
opening price on Euronext Amsterdam on the day of 
repurchase plus ten percent. Any repurchases exceeding 
these limits need approval by the General Meeting. 
Flow Traders announced one share repurchase plan in 2021. 
Several share buy backs were conducted during the course 
of 2021 to satisfy the requirements of various employee 
incentive plans as launched on 23 July 2021 and completed 
in November 2021 in connection with its employee incentive 
plans.

In order to align our employees’ interests with those of our 
shareholders, the company awards 100 shares in the 
company to most employees with a tenure of over two 
years. The company purchased part of such shares under the 
authority granted by the General Meeting over the course of 
2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 
At the 2021 AGM the Management Board will propose to the 
General Meeting to (i) renew its authorization to repurchase 
shares in the company, and (ii) cancel shares in the share 
capital of the Company held or repurchased by the Company 
under the aforementioned authorization to repurchase 
shares in the Company.
Cancelation of shares
Shares may be canceled by the company by a decision of the 
Management Board. This decision must be approved by the 
Supervisory Board. During the 2021 AGM, our shareholders 
voted for the authorization of the Management Board to, 
subject to the Supervisory Board’s approval, cancel shares in 
the share capital of the company. The number of shares that 
can be canceled, shall be determined by the Management 
Board, but may not exceed ten percent of the issued share 
capital at 24 April 2021, i.e. up to 4,653,450 shares can be 
canceled. The cancelation may be executed in one or more 
parts.
Major shareholders
The following shareholders filed their interests in the capital 
of the company exceeding 3% to be included in the AFM’s 
register of substantial holdings and gross short positions as

The shares indirectly held by Roger Hodenius (Avalon 
Holding B.V.) and Jan van Kuijk (Javak Investments B.V.) are 
long-term investments. The shares held in treasury by Flow 
Traders are from the share repurchases conducted in 2020 
and 2021 predominantly connected with various employee 
incentive plans.
Relationship agreement and shareholders agreement
Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. entered into 
a relationship agreement with the company and 
a shareholders’ agreement (amongst each other).
The relationship agreement is a Dutch law-governed 
agreement that contains certain arrangements regarding 
the relationship between the parties thereto. The agreement 
currently grants each of Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak 
Investments B.V. a specific right to nominate or designate 
one Supervisory Board member for appointment (and 
replacement). This right expires, in respect of each relevant 
party, if such party ceases to, directly or indirectly, 
hold more than five percent of the shares in the company 
provided that and for as long as, in aggregate, Avalon 
Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. together continue 
to, directly or indirectly, hold more than five percent of the 
company’s shares, Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak 
Investments B.V. shall be entitled to jointly designate one 
Supervisory Board member for appointment. The 
relationship agreement also governs the composition of the 
Supervisory Board committees. The agreement terminates 
in respect of each of the shareholders, if such party’s 
aggregate shareholding in the company (be it direct, indirect 
or together with a permitted transferee) falls below five 
percent of the company’s outstanding share capital. In case 
of, among other things, the company becoming subject to 
insolvency procedures, liquidation, delisting, a merger or 
a spin-off (with the company as disappearing entity), 
the agreement automatically terminates.
Under the shareholders’ agreement governed by Dutch law, 
Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. have agreed 
on certain arrangements in respect of their shareholding in 
the company. These arrangements include an obligation for 
each of the parties to vote in favor of the appointment of 
any individual designated by any of them as a member of the 
Supervisory Board in accordance with the terms of the 
relationship agreement (as described above). Furthermore, 
the parties agreed to reserve the right to consult with each

other and coordinate the exercise of their voting rights 
attached to their respective shares in the company. 
The shareholders’ agreement terminates for any party if 
such party’s aggregate shareholding in the company (be it 
direct or indirect) falls below three percent of the company’s 
outstanding share capital and in case of, among other things, 
the company becoming subject to insolvency procedures, 
liquidation, delisting, a merger or spin-off (with the company 
as disappearing entity).
No dedicated take-over protection structures
Flow Traders does not employ any of the following 
dedicated take-over protection structures: preference 
shares, depositary receipts or call options issued to vehicles 
conducive to protecting the company’s interest or 
independence.
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
The Corporate Governance Code defines a company as 
a long-term form of collaboration between the principal 
corporate bodies of a company. For Flow Traders, these 
corporate bodies include the Management Board, 
the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting. 
The Management Board values and considers the interests 
of the various stakeholders involved. Good corporate 
governance results in effective decision-making in a manner 
which enhances shareholder value and enables a company 
to maintain a culture of integrity, transparency, and trust. 
The company has a long standing focus on a long-term 
value creation strategy, culture and risk. We acknowledge 
the importance of good corporate governance and endeavor 
to comply in general with the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code and comply fully with it, with the 
exception of the following provisions: 
	
◾
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
Best practice provision 2.1.5 provides that the 
Supervisory Board should draw up a diversity policy for 
the composition of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. The policy should address the 
concrete targets relating to diversity. Flow Traders 
deviates from best practice provision 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 as 
no concrete targets are set on diversity within the 
company. However, the Supervisory Board has drawn up 
and adopted an Equal Opportunity Policy addressing 
the diversity aspects of the composition of the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. We believe 
that this policy also attains the purpose of best practice 
provision 2.1.5. In our view, the policy contributes to 
good governance, as it reflects our objective to treat 
everyone equally during the hiring process and 
throughout their careers at Flow Traders. Flow Traders is 
committed to being a truly equal opportunity employer, 
by recruiting, retaining and promoting people based on 
merit, and merit alone. The company is a firm believer in 
the benefits of a diverse workplace and does not make 
any concessions to quality. The objective is to provide 
equal employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all 
employees, provided they perform highly. 
When positions become available, Flow Traders actively 
encourages all candidates to apply and ensure that the 
selection and retention processes are truly equal for all 
applicants and employees. This also holds for the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it 
comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, Flow Traders adheres to the same 
principle of equal opportunity as set out above.

The Management Board comprises 20% (1 out of 5 
members) female members and our Supervisory Board 
comprises 33.3% (2 out of 6 members) female 
members. As a result, our current Supervisory Board is 
diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, education, nationality, 
and professional backgrounds. 
	
◾
Independence of Supervisory Board members
Best practice provision 2.1.7 provides that any one of the 
criteria referred to in best practice provision 2.1.8 (i.-v.) 
should be applicable to at most one Supervisory Board 
member and that the total number of Supervisory 
Board members to whom the criteria referred to in best 
practice provision 2.1.8 are applicable, should account 
for less than half of the total number of Supervisory 
Board Members. Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius, 
as founders of the company, were attracted to their 
role as Supervisory Board members because of their 
specific business-related expertise. They do not qualify 
as independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they are former members of the 
Management Board of the company prior to its 
conversion and because they represent shareholders of 
the company owning an interest of over ten percent. 
Deviation from this provision is likely to continue until 
Roger Hodenius and Jan van Kuijk cease to be members 
of the Supervisory Board.
	
◾
Independence of committee members
As Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent Supervisory Board members as set out 
above, this also affects two Supervisory Board 
committees of which they are members. Best practice 
provision 2.3.4 provides that more than half of the 
members of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee should be 
independent. Both Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius are 
members of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, implying that half (and not more than half) 
of its members are independent. Deviation from this 
provision is likely to continue until Roger Hodenius and 
Jan van Kuijk cease to be members of the Supervisory 
Board. 
	
◾
Analyses carried out in respect of variable 
compensation
Best practice provision 3.2.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code provides that the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee should submit a proposal to 
the Supervisory Board concerning the remuneration of 
individual members of the Management Board. 
The proposal is drawn up in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy that has been established and will, 
in any event, cover the remuneration structure, 
the amount of the fixed and variable remuneration 
components, the performance criteria used, 
the scenario analyses that are carried out and the pay 
ratios within the company and its affiliated enterprises. 
We do not fully comply with the scenario analyses that 
are carried out as the variable remuneration for the 
members of the Management Board is contingent upon 
a future, unknown, metric: the accrued firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool which itself depends on 
operating result for the given financial year. Because of 
the nature of our business activities and the fast paced 
industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable compensation 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year 
while performing a single, one-off assessment at the 
end of the year as set out in the best practice provisions. 
Semi-annual discussions take place between the 
Management Board members and the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee for this purpose. In this 
manner, the Supervisory Board regularly assesses the 
performance indicators and the potential resulting 
variable compensation for the Management Board 
members. Targets are set for each individual 
Management Board member and the Management 
Board as a whole. Significant underperformance or 
overperformance in respect of these targets can result 
in reductions or increases of the profit share that is 
awarded to a Management Board member. 
	
◾
Quorum
Best practice provision 4.3.3 provides that the General 
Meeting of a company that is not subject to the 
statutory large company regime (structuurregime) may 
adopt a resolution to cancel the binding nature of 
a nomination for the appointment of a member of the 
Management Board or of the Supervisory Board and/or 
a resolution to remove a member of the Management 
Board or of the Supervisory Board by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast. According to the Corporate 
Governance Code, it may be provided that this majority 
should represent a given proportion of the issued 
capital, which proportion may not exceed one-third. 
If this proportion of the capital is not represented at the 
meeting, but an absolute majority of the votes cast is in 
favor of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of 
a nomination or to remove a board member, a new 
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may 
be passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
regardless of the proportion of the capital represented 
at the meeting. In deviation of this best practice 
provision, the company’s Articles of Association provide 
that the General Meeting may pass a resolution to 
cancel the binding nature of a nomination for the

impact on the results of Flow Traders N.V. that come forth 
from these identified risks. The design and functioning of 
the internal risk management and control systems is based 
on the Flow Traders Risk Management Framework (RFM). 
The framework explained in detail in the Risk Management 
section, combine various financial and non-financial risk 
disciplines into a single converged approach and provide the 
businesses with an overview on their risks and the way these 
are managed. The Risk and Mid-Office department and 
Internal Audit Function assessed the controls in this process 
and reported its findings to the Management Board. These 
findings have been evaluated by the Management Board 
and by the Supervisory Board. This view allows the Executive 
Board and senior management to form an opinion on the 
adequacy of internal risk management and control systems 
regarding the risks they face while pursuing the 
Management Board’s strategy.
On the basis of the above, and in accordance with best 
practice provision 1.4.3 of the Corporate Governance Code, 
and with due observance of the limitations stated below, 
we confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
	
◾
The annual report provides sufficient insights into any 
failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk 
management and control systems (see chapter Our 
governance);
	
◾
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial and tax reporting does not 
contain any material inaccuracies (see chapter Our 
governance);
	
◾
Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justified that the financial reporting is 
prepared on a going concern basis (see chapters Value 
creation and strategy, Our performance and Financial 
statements); and
	
◾
the diversity policy regarding the composition of the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board 
including its aims, how it is being effected and the 
results can be found in the chapters Our governance 
and the Supervisory Board Report (section 3a sub d of 
the Decree); and
	
◾
the disclosure of the information required by the 
Decree on Section 10 EU Takeover Directive can be 
found in the chapter Our governance (section 3b of the 
Decree).
Management Board In Control Statement 
In accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the 2016 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code, Management Board of 
Flow Traders N.V.. states that it is responsible for the design, 
implementation and functioning of Flow Traders’s internal 
risk management and control systems. Flow Traders’ 
internal risk management and control is a process, 
effectuated by the Management Board, senior 
management, and other personnel. It is designed to mitigate 
risks and provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
achievement of objectives in the following categories:
	
◾
Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
	
◾
Reliability of financial and non-financial information; 
	
◾
Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies, 
	
◾
Safeguarding of assets, identification and management 
of liabilities; and
	
◾
Strategic goals of the Flow Traders group.
The Risk Management section as part of the Report of the 
Management Board elaborates on Flow Traders’ identified 
financial and non-financial risks and how these risks are 
managed. These chapters provide insight into the potential 
appointment of a member of the Management Board 
or of the Supervisory Board and/or a resolution to 
remove a member of the Management Board or of the 
Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes 
cast, representing more than 50 percent of the 
company’s issued capital. In addition, the company’s 
Articles of Association provide that if this quorum is not 
present or represented at the meeting, such resolution 
cannot be adopted and in order for such a resolution to 
be adopted, a new meeting should be convened in 
which more than 50 percent of the company’s issued 
capital is represented and an absolute majority of the 
votes are cast in favor of such resolution.

Conformity statement
The Management Board is required to prepare the Annual

(IFRS) that were endorsed by the European Union. 
Conformity statement pursuant to section 5:25c 
paragraph 2(c) of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act 
(Wet op het financieel toezicht). 
The Management Board is responsible for maintaining 
proper accounting records, for safeguarding assets and for 
taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. It is responsible for selecting suitable 
accounting policies and applying them on a consistent basis, 
making judgements and estimates that are prudent and 
reasonable. It is also responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal procedures which ensure that all major 
financial information is known to the Management Board, 
so that the timeliness, completeness and correctness of the 
external financial reporting are assured.

The report states those material risks and uncertainties 
that are relevant to the expectation of the company’s 
continuity for the period of twelve months after the 
preparation of the report (see chapters Value creation 
and strategy, Our performance, Our governance and 
Financial statements).
It should be noted that the above does not imply that these 
systems and procedures provide absolute assurance to Flow 
Traders N.V. as to the realisation of financial and strategic 
business objectives, or that internal risk management and 
control systems can prevent or detect all misstatements, 
inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-compliances with

How has COVID-19 impacted the credit 
markets? 
Jasper: “We have seen a significant increase 
in the number of tickets traded electron­
ically over the past year; in € investment 
grade (IG), for example, electronic trading is 
well above 40%. And while high-yield (HY) 
and emerging market debt (EMD) have 
a much lower electronic execution rate, we 
have still seen an uptick in electronification 
in these areas and expect it to continue to 
increase. The size of individual electronic 
trades is also growing; where in the past 
tickets of €250k-€500k were predomi­
nantly executed electronically, now it is not 
uncommon to see RFQs of €1 million or 
more.”
What do you think is the future of credit 
trading?
Ramon: “While in the past credit markets 
could not be compared to other asset 
classes, this seems to be changing as 
a consequence of electronification and 
algorithmic trading driven mainly by market 
regulation and the penetration of non-bank 
liquidity providers such as Flow Traders. 
What has become clear is that we are close 
to the inflection point of electronification, 
resulting in more efficient and transparent 
execution. Looking at the technology 
developments we have seen over the past 
10-15 years in other classes, such as equity 
index products or FX, we can expect to see 
similar developments in bond markets. 
Once we are past the inflection point, we 
expect to see electronic trading volumes 
developing by at least a multiplier of three, 
or higher”
What do you think will be the impact of algo 
trading on credit markets? 
Matheus: “Applying our advanced 
algorithms in bond trading has enabled us to 
absorb all available market information and 
arrive at the most competitive price. 
Additionally, it allows us to quote on average 
within five seconds, leading to more 
efficient execution. If algo trading continues 
to increase at this pace, this will lead to 
a market equilibrium where information is 
immediately reflected in the price, leading 
to the best price for the investor.”
The size of 
individual 
electronic 
trades is 
growing

Name: Matheus Haserick-Lara
Position: Managing Director, Head of Trading, US
Name:  Jasper Jansen
Position: Head of Fixed Income Trading
What do you think will be the main driver for dealer selection 
in the future?
Ramon: “We foresee that firm/live pricing markets will 
dominate the credit market. With firm prices being updated 
virtually every second, we can provide certainty to the 
investor that ‘what you see is what you get’ and that this is 
the best possible price reflecting the current market. 
The buy-side already uses firm prices as a factor but it will 
become increasingly more important for decision making.”
What is your view on the type of protocols that will be used in 
the future?
Jasper: “We believe all protocols that promote pre-trade 
transparency and cost efficiencies – such as firm prices, 
requests for two-way markets, and CLOBs – will increase in 
volume and importance. We think that two-way markets 
will also solve some of the concerns the buy-side has 
around information leakage just as we have seen in ETF 
markets. Additionally, we believe PT will continue to be an 
important protocol.”
Do you think there is room in the market for new bond venues?
Matheus: “We believe that competition among venues and 
new platforms has a positive impact on the market in 
general. It drives innovation, which leads to new trading 
protocols, an increase in electronic execution rates, and 
a rise in more sophisticated auto-execution mechanisms, as 
well as driving down direct and indirect execution costs.”
What are the major benefits of portfolio trading?
Jasper: “The benefits of PT are certainty of execution, cost 
savings, and transparency. PT allows end investors to 
receive a fair and competitive price for all their bonds, 
including their illiquid ones. In our opinion, the all-or-
nothing protocol is one of the more important and 
innovative concepts in PT. Increasingly, other asset classes 
within Fixed Income are being used for PT, such as £ credit, 
as well as large mixed portfolios consisting of rates and 
credit products. The ETF ecosystem will also add additional 
liquidity to the credit markets, as a lot of bonds are traded 
by ETF market makers on the back of their Authorized 
Participant (AP) activities. As ETFs are used as hedging tools 
for PTs and they are traded without going to the bond 
market, such as on exchanges, this means liquidity can also 
enter the bond market in this way.”
What are the portfolio trading market developments in 
Europe and the US?
Ramon / Matheus: “According to our estimates, PT in 
Europe has grown from virtually nothing to around €16bn of 
executed volumes per month in just two years, representing 
around 6% of total trading in European credit markets. 
This growth was already evident in the US, and we expect 
that the increase in executed volumes will continue to grow 
in both regions to at least 10% of the total market. 
PT trading is still dominated by IG, but we also see fast 
growth in HY and EM. We also embrace the initiatives of the 
venues to automate trading processes. Where in the past 
PTs were predominantly priced via sheets and negotiated in 
chats, we now see a clear trend towards electronic methods 
ways of execution. Additionally, the size of trades has also 
increased and it is now not uncommon to see trades above 
€500 million.”
The Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) 
implementation is on everyone’s agenda. How do you think 
this regulation will impact the market?
Ramon: “We expect that CSDR will affect liquidity, 
especially on the offer side. This will increase the 
importance of dealers, who are providing constant liquidity 
and who have substantial bond inventories from axes. 
Past settlement performance and dealer relationships will 
increase in value for buy-side investors, as the penalties for 
failing settlements and buy-in risks will be very costly.”

Message of the Chairman
The primary focus of the Supervisory Board in 2021 was to 
guide and help prepare the company for significant growth 
and further extensive development of the business, with the 
aim of the Company playing a more pro-active role in its 
expanding ecosystem and leveraging the rapidly-evolving 
opportunities within the financial-markets landscape.
Record new talent recruitment
This ambition led to the planning and implementation of 
successful hiring initiatives at all levels of the organization, 
and across all regions in which Flow Traders operates. 
In 2021, Flow Traders recruited a record number of new team 
members, with more than 160 hires and multi talent cycles 
for our Trading Graduate and Technology Graduates, as part 
of our ambition to continue to foster up and coming talent. 
Experienced new board members 
We are delighted to have been welcoming two new and 
highly experienced additions to Flow Traders’ Supervisory 
Board, Linda Hovius and Ilonka Jankovich. Their collective 
experience is a real asset to the Supervisory Board as we 
deepen our expertise and bring in a dynamic mindset to help 
support the business as it continues to grow. 
Importantly, the Management Board was also further 
strengthened in 2021, with Mike Kuehnel joining as Chief 
Financial Officer. Mike’s broad skill set and extensive 
professional experience will help the team as it pursues and 
executes an accelerated strategic agenda. 
Open dialogue at all levels:
Throughout the year the Supervisory Board focused on 
direct engagement and open dialogue with our people, 
holding a series of meetings where employees could share 
their feedback and insights. This included a significant 
number of sessions held separately from formal Supervisory 
Board meetings. 
These engagement sessions, which were facilitated by 
several Supervisory Board Members, enabled us to discuss 
priorities and aspirations with employees from all parts and 
levels of the organization. The Supervisory Board found the 
discussions to be extremely useful, and we view them as 
powerful opportunities to support the business. We want to 
thank everyone who participated for their open and 
productive feedback. We are committed to continuing this 
dialogue, as we believe such opportunities of direct 
involvement benefit the whole organization and help inform 
the shaping of our roles on the Supervisory Board.  
The Supervisory Board in 2021
During 2021, the Supervisory Board held a total of 37 
meetings across the year. The Supervisory Board held 14 
plenary meetings and 20 through its four committees: The 
Audit committee, the Remuneration and Appointment 
committee, the Trading and Technology committee, and the 
Risk committee. The Supervisory Board and its committees 
continue to operate effectively with competent and diligent 
members, who bring extensive and broadly diversified 
experience to the table and ensure we have progressive 
dialogues on all our key topics.

Looking ahead
Looking ahead, the Supervisory Board aims to intensify its 
dialogue with key stakeholders and to continue to engage in 
the timely evaluation of important themes related to the 
business. It will remain connected to main regulatory, 
talent, ESG and technology developments to ensure the 
Supervisory Board can continue to support the business with 
impact. One important focus area will be the continued 
development of the company’s ESG propositions, as we 
believe this will improve Flow Traders’ relationship with 
stakeholders and lead to greater transparency.
Other important areas of attention will be supporting the 
business as it executes the strategy, taking advantage of 
new opportunities, both organic as well as non-organic, 
and in building the team which will take Flow Traders to the 
next level.  We will also support the entire organization 
during the planned investor day in 2022. 
On behalf of the Supervisory Board I would like to 
compliment the Flow Traders team for their exceptional 
efforts and achievements in 2021.  Our gratitude goes out to 
everyone on our team for their tremendous contributions 
during a second year operating under highly challenging 
conditions.
Throughout the year, the Supervisory Board discussed a wide 
range of topics including the performance, evaluation and 
targets of Management Board members, the Supervisory 
Board’s own performance, the remuneration of 
Management Board members as well as the proposal for 
a new remuneration policy, strategic investments and 
projects, succession planning and the talent pipeline on key 
positions. 
The Supervisory Board also sought opportunities to engage 
with various shareholders, representing a wide range of 
holding sizes. In addition, several Supervisory Board 
members undertook direct engagement with proxy advisors 
in 2021, to engage in open and proactive dialogue on a range 
of topics, including our talent retention and remuneration 
philosophy. 
During the year the Supervisory Board continued to discuss 
steps the company is taking to strengthen its environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) efforts. This includes social 
responsibility towards the workforce and enabling equal 
opportunities for all. Flow Traders also carried out the 
necessary assessments to determine its CO2 footprint and 
ensure it remains carbon neutral. 
Our culture of informal collaboration, effective 
communication and rapid innovation, our strengthened 
leadership team and the tremendous energy and 
extraordinary talent of our people will allow us to aim even 
higher in 2022, as we continue to pursue our ambitious 
goals. This will enable the company to achieve sustainable 
returns for all of our stakeholders.
With best regards, 
Rudolf Ferscha

capital and remuneration requirements set out in the EU 
Investment Firm Regulation and EU Investment Firm 
Directive and the implementation of the Shareholders 
Rights Directive II. During the Supervisory Board 
meetings, there were regular updates on specific 
projects and the company’s regulatory capital 
requirements under CRR and other prime broker capital

the Management Board in continuing to advocate for 
a level playing field in terms of capital requirements 
across our global ecosystem.

company’s policies, By-Laws and Terms of Reference of 
each of the committees. In 2021 the By-Laws of the 
Management Board were reviewed, amended and

◾
Succession planning and diversity
The term of Rudolf Ferscha, as Supervisory Board 
member, expired in 2021. Eric Drok choose not to opt for 
reappointment during the 2021 AGM, hence succession 
planning of the Supervisory Board formed an important 
topic of discussion during the Supervisory Board and 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee meetings.  
Eric Drok stepped down from his Chairmanship in March, 
and the Supervisory Board unanimously appointed 
Rudolf Ferscha as Chair of the Supervisory Board. 
Both Ilonka Jankovich and Linda Hovius were appointed 
as members of the Supervisory Board during the 2021 
AGM held on 23 April 2021. Following the transition from 
four Management Board members to five Management 
Board members during 2021, the succession planning of 
the Management Board was also discussed. 
When discussing succession planning, the company’s 
Equal Opportunity Policy is always taken into account.
	
◾
Culture and core values
Culture has always and will always form a very important 
role within Flow Traders, especially with most employees 
working from home during 2021 as a result of COVID-19. 
Culture and the company’s core values have been 
regularly discussed during the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee meetings and the Supervisory 
Board meetings. The Whistleblower Policy and the 
company’s Code of Conduct and the awareness of 
employees thereof have been discussed during the year.

Meetings of the Supervisory Board

times without holding a formal meeting. Examples of 
meetings without holding a formal meeting include 
a preparation session for the AGM, education and strategy 
days and the self-assessment day. During these meetings 
a number of topics, including the following, were discussed:
	
◾
The company’s strategy 
The Management Board focuses on the long-term value 
creation of the company and has involved the 
Supervisory Board in translating this long-term value 
creation into the company’s strategy. The Supervisory 
Board regularly discusses the strategy, 
the implementation of the strategy, and any associated 
risks. During the year, starting in February 2021, 
the Supervisory Board and the Management Board 
together discussed the company’s strategic direction. 
Input was also provided into the detailed and thorough 
review of Flow Traders’ capital structure being 
undertaken by the Management Board which 
commenced in the latter part of the year. 
The Supervisory Board agreed on financial and 
non-financial KPIs of the Management Board, these KPIs 
are further explained in the chapter on Governance.
	
◾
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the company’s risk assessment processes and 
the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems remain a priority and 
joint responsibility of the Supervisory Board and all

The Management Board also attended each meeting in 
full or in part. Due to the COVID-19 measures and the 
corresponding travel restrictions, most of the meetings 
were held via conference call. The Supervisory Board 
meetings achieved an average attendance rate of 98.6%.
Evaluation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of the 
self-assessment of 2020, and the follow-up on conclusions 
of that self-assessment. As a result of the conclusions of 
the assessment, the Supervisory Board continued the 
initiative launched in 2018 to host a dedicated Strategy Day, 
even though the set-up has changed during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Additionally, the Supervisory Board ensured 
a clear link between the company KPI’s and its strategy. 
In 2021, the Supervisory Board also reviewed its own 
performance using a combination of an electronic survey 
and a group discussion. Using the same questionnaire year 
over year enabled comparisons with last year’s results. 
Compared to 2021, the Supervisory Board concluded that it 
has continued to function well. Specific items for follow up 
that arose this year included continued focus on strategy, 
the composition of the Supervisory Board and in-depth 
knowledge of the business of Flow Traders and its 
regulatory environment. 
The Supervisory Board’s self-assessment includes an 
independence-assessment. The independence assessment

education, nationality, and professional backgrounds. 
Our Equal Opportunity Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
Succession planning
Until 10 September 2021, the Management Board consisted 
of four members. During the EGM held on 10 September 
2021, shareholders voted in favor of the appointment of 
Mike Kuehnel as member of the Management Board and 
Chief Financial Officer of the company. The full size and 
composition of the Management Board was discussed 
regularly during 2021. Our Equal Opportunity Policy was an 
important topic during these discussions. Eric Drok choose 
not to opt for reappointment after the end of his mandate in 
2021 and Rudolf Ferscha replaced him as Chair of the 
Supervisory Board and was reappointed at the AGM in 2021 
together with the appointments of Linda Hovius and Ilonka 
Jankovich. The figure in the middle column shows the terms 
of (re)appointment for all Supervisory Board members.
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
The company has an Equal Opportunity Policy in place. 
In this policy we explain our objective to treat everyone 
equally during the hiring process and throughout their 
careers at Flow Traders. We are committed to being a truly 
equal opportunity employer, by recruiting, retaining and 
promoting people based on merit, and merit alone. We are 
a firm believer in the benefits of a diverse workplace and we 
do not make any concessions to quality. Our objective is to 
provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all of our 
employees, provided they perform highly. When positions 
become available, we actively encourage all candidates to 
apply and ensure that the selection and retention processes 
are truly equal for all applicants and employees. This also 
holds for our Management Board and Supervisory Board. 
When it comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, we adhere to the same principles of 
equal opportunity as set out above. As a result, our current 
Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
these discussions the Remuneration and Appointment 
Committee provides feedback regarding its view on the 
Management Board’s performance to the Supervisory 
Board, to guide year-end discussions on variable rewards.
Profile of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board Profile provides that the 
qualifications of a particular candidate and fit with the 
company’s needs shall always prevail when filling a position. 
When selecting members, the Supervisory Board aims for 
a balance in nationality, gender, age, experience, and active 
or retired backgrounds. In addition, balance in the 
experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the 
business of the company will be sought. The Supervisory 
Board strives to realize a diverse composition in the 
nomination and appointment process for vacancies, while 
taking into account the overall profile and selection criteria 
for appointments of suitable candidates to the Supervisory 
Board. As such, diversity, including gender-related, is an 
important consideration in the selection process for the (re)
appointment of Supervisory Board members. The 
Supervisory Board Profile can be found on our website: 
www.flowtraders.com.
Training and Induction
Our new Supervisory Board members, Linda Hovius and 
Ilonka Jankovich, were provided with an induction program, 
including presentations from Management Board and Global 
Heads. The training also included modules that are part of 
the Flow Academy and available for all employees, such as 
trading for non-traders. The Supervisory Board members 
are trained on a regular basis on the landscape that Flow 
Traders operate in. In 2021, the education day held for the 
Supervisory Board focused on the various aspects of Digital 
Asset trading.

Independence of the Supervisory Board
The Chair of the Supervisory Board is not a former member 
of the company’s Management Board and is independent 
within the meaning of best practice provision 2.1.8 of the 
Corporate Governance Code. Supervisory Board members 
Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they, as founders of Flow Traders, 
are former members of the company’s Management Board 
and represent shareholders of the company. 
Committees
The Supervisory Board has four committees: the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, 
the Trading & Technology Committee, and the Risk 
Committee. Each committee has a preparatory and/or 
advisory role to the Supervisory Board and reports to the 
Supervisory Board accordingly. The Chairs of the Audit 
Committee, Remuneration & Appointment Committee and 
the Risk Committee all qualify as independent under the 
provisions of the Corporate Governance Code. The Trading & 
Technology Committee and the Risk Committee were 
established to cater for the monitoring of and advising on 
specific business related topics and reflect our business 
model of focusing on pricing, cutting-edge technology 
platform and risk management. The Trading & Technology 
Committee is chaired by the one of the founders and former 
Management Board member of the company. For more

and capital management policy (including dividend 
proposals), assessing the company’s compliance with rules 
and regulations (including among others, CRR and IFR/IFD),

of the company’s interim financial statements and issued an 
unqualified review report. The Audit Committee evaluated 
the qualifications, performance and independence of EY, 
taking into account the opinions of the Management Board. 
The Audit Committee also obtained a report from the 
external auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. EY confirmed its independence 
from Flow Traders in accordance with the professional 
standards applicable to it. Based on the information 
provided by the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board 
nominated EY as external auditor at the company’s General 
Meeting in 2021. Subsequently, EY was reappointed by the 
General Meeting as external auditor for the financial year 
2021.
Internal audit function 
The Internal Audit Function (IAF) executed audits that form 
part of the internal audit plan, approved by the Supervisory 
Board. On 25 January 2021, a new Global Head of Internal 
Audit started his role at Flow Traders.  Focus areas in this 
audit plan of 2021 included, the resilience of our trading 
systems and controls, IT tools and adherence to regulatory 
requirements, among others. The Audit Committee and the 
Global Head of Internal Audit discussed the audit results 
from 2020 (findings, observations, recommendations, 
management feedback and follow-up).  The IAF also 
delivered an updated Internal Audit Charter as well as an 
updated audit plan for 2022 The Audit Committee maintains 
regular dialogue with the IAF, particularly in relation to 
Supervisory Board about the reappointment of the external 
auditor, before the Supervisory Board determines its 
nomination for the appointment of the external auditor to 
the General Meeting 0f 2021. Given the nature of our 
business, the application of information and communication 
technology by the company, including risks relating to cyber 
security, are discussed in detail in the Trading & Technology 
Committee. Subsequently, key items in respect of these 
items are also discussed in the Audit Committee.

Financial statements and dividend
The 2021 financial statements were prepared by the 
Management Board. They were discussed both with the 
Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, in attendance 
of EY. The financial statements were audited by EY, 
who issued an unqualified auditor’s report. Reference is 
made to the auditor’s report on page 165 of the financial 
statements. The Supervisory Board approved the financial 
statements as audited by EY, including the company’s 
dividend proposal. We invite the General Meeting to:
	
◾
adopt the financial statements for 2021;
	
◾
adopt the dividend proposal as proposed by the 
Management Board and approved by the Supervisory 
Board; and
	
◾
discharge the Management Board for their 
management and the Supervisory Board for its 
supervision of the company in the financial year under 
review.
Information on the remuneration of the Management Board 
members can be found in the chapter Remuneration.
Supervisory Board members are members of the Trading & 
Technology Committee. The committee addresses trading 
topics such as, but not limited to, the general market 
conditions, the (relative) performance of the trading desks 
across the various regions Flow Traders operates in, 
Flow Traders’ focus areas and growth strategies. 
Competitiveness, infrastructure and trading relationships, 
innovation and (cyber-) security were the main technology 
topics discussed during the year.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met four times in 2021, with each 
meeting fully attended. Invitees of the meeting were the 
Management Board members, a new global head of Risk and 
relevant others. The main focus in the meetings was the 
Management Board’s risk assessment. The attendees 
discussed in detail the relevant risks the company is 
exposed to, the internal controls in place to address these 
risks, the Management Board’s views on such risks, as well 
as the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
internal risk management and control system. The 
committee has discussed the way material risks and 
uncertainties have been analyzed and discussed, the ICAAP 
and the Capital Requirement Regulation as well as the IFR/
IFD regulation were also topics of discussion. More 
information can be found in the chapter Governance.

Remuneration in 2021
The Supervisory Board, in close consultation with, 
and supported by, the Management Board has decided that 
the 2021 firm-wide variable remuneration pool will be 
€83.3 million1, corresponding to 35% of the operating result 
in 2021.  The Supervisory Board has also determined the 
2021 variable remuneration awards to the members of the 
Management Board, upon the proposal of the Remuneration 
Committee, in accordance with the remuneration policy 
adopted at the 2016 AGM, while also considering the new 
policy proposed at the 2022 AGM. The performance of the 
Management Board has been reviewed against their 
individual KPI scorecards, which cover both quantitative and 
qualitative targets. Following extensive considerations and 
thorough review of the performance of each member of the 
Management Board, we have decided that 6.1% of the 
variable remuneration pool shall be allocated to the 
Management Board. This is what we believe is a fair 
allocation and aligns with our long-standing company 
philosophy of sharing our profits and creating equal 
opportunities to share in both success and risk, followed 
since we were founded and has contributed to the success 
Flow Traders has achieved. This approach provides 
a relatively modest base salary, no benefits and a profit 
share that directly reflects company performance - 
therefore varying considerably in successful and less 
successful financial years. 
Company performance and progress 
Market conditions in 2021 were more stable compared to 
2020. Volatility, as measured by the VIX index, averaged at 
19.88 (2020: 29.49), with a high of 37.51 (2020: 85.47). 
Nevertheless, 2021 was a successful year for Flow Traders. 
Total value traded in 2021 amounted to €5.7 trillion (2020: 
€5.2 trillion); of which, €1.54 trillion was traded in ETPs 
(2020: €1.52 trillion). In terms of Net Traded Income (NTI), 
we experienced a highly successful year with NTI reaching 
€384 million. This is the second highest NTI result in Flow 
Traders’ history after 2020.
On the cost side, we continued to maintain a firm discipline 
with fixed operating expenses amounting to €122.1 million in 
2021 (2020: €118.6 million), which is within the cost guidance 
provided in the beginning of 2021. We saw an increase in 
FTEs to 613 as of 31 December 2021 compared to 554 on 
31 December 2020. Despite this increase, variable employee 
expenses saw a significant decrease to €102.5 million in 2021 
(2020: €228.1 million), reflecting the reduced variable 
remuneration pool. In light of the reduced top line 
compared to 2020 and, as a result, reduced operational 
leverage, net profit amounted to €114.9 million (2020: 
€464.5 million), while EBITDA achieved in 2021 is €159.4 
million (2020: €586.6 million), with an EBITDA margin of 
41%.
The wellbeing of our people has continued to be a point of 
focus throughout 2021. We have continued to facilitate 
working from home for the majority of our staff. As the 
pandemic evolved, we welcomed many of our colleagues 
back into our offices, with many adopting a hybrid working 
model. Further, Flow Traders opened a new office in Paris 
during 2021. 
Letter from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, 
I am pleased to present our 2021 Remuneration Report. 
This report includes a summary of our remuneration policy 
currently in place, as approved at the 2016 AGM, and the 
remuneration paid out in 2021 in accordance with this policy. 
The full remuneration policy has been published on our 
website www.flowtraders.com. The remuneration report 
reflects the reporting requirements originating from the 
updated EU Shareholder Rights Directive and the Dutch 
implementation of this Directive.
In addition, this report details our proposed updates to our 
policy we will submit to the 2022 AGM. As a growing 
organization, Flow Traders’ revised policy has been proposed 
following an extensive dialogue with various stakeholders, 
peer analysis and the need to create a policy to continue to 
be able to retain and attract talent of the highest caliber.

Activities of the Committee in 2021
In 2021, we put forward our revised remuneration policies 
for both the Management Board and Supervisory Board 
(binding vote) and our 2020 remuneration report (advisory 
vote) for the AGM’s approval. The remuneration policy for 
the Supervisory Board was approved by over 97% of 
shareholders, while 66% of shareholders voted in favor of 
the remuneration report. The revised policy for the 
Management Board was approved by 67% of our 
shareholders and therefore did not obtain the required 75% 
majority vote from the AGM. Therefore, we continued to 
operate under the Remuneration Policy as approved in 2016.
Stakeholder engagement
We take our stakeholder’s views very seriously and welcome 
an open dialogue with them on all aspects of remuneration. 
As the remuneration policy for the Management Board did 
not receive the required 75% vote at the 2021 AGM and 
a minority of shareholders voted against our remuneration 
report at the 2021 AGM, the Committee conducted 
consultations with those shareholders and proxy advisors to 
see whether we could further align our remuneration 
practices to shareholder expectations. 
We recognize the evolution of the corporate governance 
landscape in recent years. We believe that the principles 
that underlie our approach remain relevant. We align 
employee pay, including the Management Board, with the 
interests of shareholders and our financial performance. 
We aim to pay levels of total pay that are competitive with 
our predominantly international, and in many cases 
privately-owned, competitors and design our remuneration 
structures to encourage all our employees to stay with us 
for the longer term. To summarize, in light of the feedback 
In addition, we feel it is important to highlight a number of 
balancing elements:
	
◾
We believe in rewarding for performance. If Flow 
Traders is less successful, there is a corresponding 
downwards impact on variable remuneration levels 
without any smoothing actions
	
◾
At the same time, we defer a significant portion of the 
variable remuneration granted, and this deferred 
remuneration remains at risk until vesting. If Flow 
Traders were to make a loss in upcoming years, 
any outstanding deferred variable compensation from 
previous years will be forfeited and used to cover this 
loss.
	
◾
We share our profits fairly with our shareholders and 
employees. Although individual award levels for 
members of the Management Board may be considered 
substantial, the other employees are paid from the 
same variable remuneration pool and equally benefit 
from the company’s performance.
“We take our 
stakeholder’s views 
very seriously and 
welcome an open 
dialogue with 
on all aspects of 
remuneration. ”
we have received, we have enhanced the disclosure around 
individual KPIs and vesting schedule of deferred awards in 
our 2021 remuneration report, and we have further 
discussed the Management Board’s remuneration policy 
proposed at the 2021 AGM to see where we can further align 
with shareholders expectations. We summarize the main 
feedback provided, and how we have acted upon this 
feedback in the table below.

Main feedback from stakeholders
How we have acted upon this feedback
The policy appears to have a short-term focus
	
◾
Long-term value creation and share ownership are cornerstones of our remuneration philosophy. We propose to further align 
our remuneration policy with our philosophy and to defer a significant part of any variable remuneration award (62.5%) for a 
multi-year period (up to 4 years). A significant part (50%) of the variable remuneration is paid out in equity and subject to a 
holding period of one year after vesting.
	
◾
In addition to operating above market standards clawback provisions, we propose to update our remuneration policy and 
introduce post-termination vesting restrictions.
	
◾
We propose to update our remuneration policy and encourage our Management Board members to retain 50% of the shares 
granted as part of remuneration (after tax) until end of employment.
	
◾
We have further enhanced our disclosure practices in the 2021 remuneration report , with the aim to better explain the design 
of our remuneration policy and in particular the working of our variable remuneration plan, including better disclosure around 
individual KPI scorecards, and deferral and vesting schedule for each member of the Management Board.
Variable compensation is uncapped
	
◾
It is in our corporate DNA to share our profits fairly with our shareholders and employees, and we have done so since we were 
founded. The total variable remuneration pool available for all employees (including the Management Board) is capped at a 
maximum of 35% of operating result. In addition to this proposed change at the 2021 AGM, we propose to also introduce hard 
cap on Management Board individual variable remuneration award levels of 20 times versus the average employee variable 
remuneration awards levels.
	
◾
This translates to a hard cap of €4,066,000 on variable remuneration for each member of the Management Board in 2021. 
The total remuneration of each member of the Management Board was well within this limit.  
	
◾
We have restructured our remuneration report, with the aim to better explain the design of our remuneration policy and in 
particular the working of our variable remuneration plan.
Transparency and disclosure on pay-for-performance 
can be improved
	
◾
Following shareholder feedback, we will propose to introduce a KPI scorecard for each member of the Management Board 
with both financial and non-financial performance measures. The financial measures will ensure that any remuneration 
awarded considers multiple aspects of financial performance and not just operating profit, while non-financial measures will 
be selected to ensure sustained long-term performance. 
	
◾
We have restructured our remuneration report, with the aim to better explain the working of our variable remuneration plan. 
We have included more details on the working, dynamics, key performance indicators and performance outcomes of the 
Management Board member’s individual KPIs.
	
◾
We believe that these changes will increase transparency and certainty for shareholders and the Management Board.
On behalf of the Committee, I thank all shareholders for the constructive feedback and are looking forward to continuing our dialogue in 2022.

Application of our remuneration principles
At Flow Traders, we provide our members of the 
Management Board a remuneration package that consists of 
fixed remuneration, in the form of base salary, and variable 
remuneration:
	
◾
The long-standing foundation of our policy is a 
relatively modest base salary and variable 
remuneration that is aligned with company 
performance – therefore varying considerably in 
successful and less successful (financial) years.
	
◾
The design of our remuneration policy reflects our 
mission, corporate identity, core values & culture, 
is aligned with our long-term interests and is 
underpinned by deep risk-awareness.
Our values and culture
We strongly believe that creating a strong and successful 
business requires a set of shared values that everyone can 
rally around. Values that help shape how everyone behaves, 
feels and develops at work every day. That is why we have 
identified the core values that are the essence of Flow 
Traders:
	
◾
Open, informal and diverse 
	
◾
Taking ownership 
	
◾
Entrepreneurial 
	
◾
Team player
These values reflect the things we believe in. And they 
shape our unique, one-team driven, culture. A culture that is 
underpinned by disciplined risk awareness at every level of 
the organization.
Our remuneration principles
We believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and office are 
entitled to receive variable compensation relative to their 
contribution to the firm as a whole. We are transparent 
about how we pay our people and how much we pay them, 
including management. We have a straightforward 
remuneration policy that permits variable remuneration 
only when a profit is made. And because variable 
remuneration is, to a large extent, deferred, it remains at risk 
of forfeiture if we sustain a loss. We believe this is the 
strongest incentive for sustainable, risk-aware behavior for 
all our staff. 
Flow Traders’ approach to remuneration
Our Management Board remuneration policy aims to attract, 
motivate and retain Management Board members to lead 
Flow Traders and sustainably execute Flow Traders’ strategy. 
The remuneration policy reflects of our mission, corporate 
identity and values. The remuneration policy fosters our 
unique Flow Traders culture.
Our mission and corporate identity
We are a leading global-technology enabled liquidity 
provider, specialized in Exchange Traded Products. 
As a technology company operating in a financial 
environment, we focus on providing liquidity in financial 
products both on- and off-exchange. As a result, market 
participants benefit from higher execution quality and lower 
overall trading costs, while the markets benefit from greater 
efficiency and more transparency. The liquidity we provide in 
volatile markets helps ensure that financial markets keep 
functioning under all circumstances. Flow Traders helps 
absorb market shocks by absorbing a sudden surge in 
trading which helps stabilize markets, ensures accurate 
pricing and reduces volatility.
We are an ambitious, international company, with an 
increasing role in the financial ecosystem in the world’s 
largest financial markets. We operate in a fast moving, 
complex and highly competitive environment, at the 
intersection of trading, financial services and technology. 
As only the very best companies in this market will survive, 
we aim to attract and retain the very best people at every 
level in the organization.

These principles are also reflected in our Management Board remuneration policy:
Principle
Application
Sharing
	
◾
Given good performance, employees from any role and office are entitled to receive variable remuneration relative to their 
contribution to the firm as a whole.
	
◾
If we make no profit, we do not pay-out variable remuneration. 
Operating a single & straightforward policy
	
◾
We reward all our employees, including the Management Board, based on the same remuneration policy.
	
◾
We share one singular firm-wide variable remuneration pool.
	
◾
The Management Board does not receive material ancillary benefits beyond variable remuneration.
	
◾
As permitted by the remuneration policy, variable remuneration of Management Board members is voluntarily capped at a 
multiple of the average employee variable remuneration.
Rewarding for exceptional performance
	
◾
Remuneration consists of a relatively modest base salary and variable remuneration linked directly to performance.
	
◾
The pay-mix is skewed towards variable remuneration in good (financial) years. At the same time, we do not pay-out any 
variable remuneration – and reclaim outstanding deferrals, if we sustain a loss.
Guarding long-term interests & stimulating 
risk awareness
	
◾
We operate an integrated short-term and long-term variable remuneration plan.
	
◾
We defer a significant portion of variable remuneration pay-outs for a multi-year period.
	
◾
A significant part of any variable remuneration award is made in equity.
	
◾
If the company incurs a loss, any outstanding deferred variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited entirely to cover 
that loss.
	
◾
Our clawback provisions are comprehensive, irreversible and substantially exceed industry standards and regulatory 
requirements.
Stimulating share ownership
	
◾
A significant part of any variable remuneration award is made in equity.
	
◾
We encourage our Management Board members to retain a substantial part of equity granted as part of remuneration.
These principles guide the Remuneration and Nomination Committee when making decisions on the remuneration policy and its implementation.

Policy at a glance
Our global remuneration model reflects our key principles 
achieved through the practical implementation of the 
current General Remuneration Policy (as approved by the 
General Meeting on 19 May 2016 and published on our 
website, the ‘General Remuneration Policy’), the Dutch Act 
on Remuneration Policy of Financial Undertakings (Wet 
Beloningsbeleid Financiële Ondernemingen, the 
‘Remuneration Act’), and the related laws and regulations in 
a manner that is tailored to the size of our enterprise and the 
way it is organized, as well as the nature, scope and 
complexity of our business activities. 
The table below provides insight into the main elements of 
our existing remuneration policy and those of our proposed 
remuneration policy (subject to shareholder approval at the 
2022 AGM). We have highlighted the main changes. The full 
proposed policy will be published in combination with our 
2022 AGM convening notice on our website.
Our contribution to society
We are committed to our broader responsibility to 
society over and above our provision of liquidity and 
market making services globally (ensuring global 
markets keep functioning under all circumstances) and 
are vocal proponents of fair markets and fair taxation. 
With this in mind, we have always steered clear of (re-) 
structuring any of our operations for the objective of tax 
optimization.
In 2021, Flow Traders’ equity with a value of €2.0 million 
(2020: €6.0 million) and a cash donation €0.5 million 
were transferred to the Foundation. These transfers have 
already been accrued for in 2020. Further, we have 
committed to donate a further €0.4 million in 2022. 
In addition, in 2021, we contributed a total value of 
€0.6 million (2020: €0.2 million) to the Flow Traders 
Foundation in relation to the right to appoint charities 
which the Foundation supports.

◾
The total variable remuneration pool available for all 
employees (including the Management Board) is capped at a 
maximum of 35% of the operating profit
	
◾
Variable remuneration for any Management Board member is 
capped at 20 times the average employee variable 
remuneration. Any amount above this cap is forfeited. The 
remuneration of each Management Board member and 
average employee will be calculated in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Dutch Monitoring Commission. In 
accordance with the aforementioned, the hard cap on variable 
remuneration for each Management Board member in 2021 
corresponds to €4,066,000.
It is in our corporate DNA to share our profits 
fairly with our shareholders and employees, 
and we have done so since we were founded. 
We have now reflected shareholders concerns 
in our policy by introducing a hard cap on 
individual variable remuneration pay-outs of 
Management Board members versus the 
average employee. 
The proposed cap ensures that our total 
remuneration levels are competitive with the 
industry we operate in, while addressing 
shareholder concerns around uncapped 
variable remuneration approach.

Rationale for change
Performance 
measurement
	
◾
Performance is measured over a 
one-year performance period
	
◾
Variable remuneration awards are 
predominantly based on Flow 
Traders’ result on operating profit
	
◾
Management Board member’s 
individual performance on individual

◾
Management Board members’ individual performance will be 
assessed against a KPI scorecard with both short-term and 
long-term targets. The KPI scorecard along with performance 
against targets will be disclosed in the annual remuneration 
report 
	
◾
Management Board member’s individual performance on 
individual KPIs can have an upwards or downwards impact on 
the award size in case of overperformance or 
underperformance
To further align our remuneration policy with 
shareholder expectations, we will assess each 
Management Board member’s individual 
performance against a specific KPI scorecard 
and disclose their performance against these 
in the annual remuneration report.
The proposed change is a further 
enhancement of what we proposed in 2021.

◾
Variable remuneration is paid out 
fully in cash
	
◾
Above a certain threshold, variable 
remuneration is paid out in at least

50% of variable remuneration is paid out in equity
	
◾
62.5% of variable remuneration is deferred over a period up to 
four years
	
◾
The cash component of the variable remuneration will vest on 
a pro-rata basis over a two-year period, whereby the first 
tranche will vest at date of award
	
◾
The equity component of the variable remuneration will vest 
over a 4-year period on a pro-rata basis, whereby the first 
tranche will vest at date of award
	
◾
All equity awards that vest are subject to a holding period of 
one year
We have further aligned our policy with our 
guiding principles for remuneration
The proposed policy changes put more 
emphasis on the long-term character of our 
variable remuneration plan. The significant 
deferral in combination with a substantial 
pay-out in equity will lead to further 
alignment of Management Board interests and 
those of our stakeholders
Furthermore, the deferral provisions are 
designed to encourage retention as deferred 
awards do not give rise to any immediate 
entitlement.

place between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee for this purpose. 
Key performance indicators are set for each individual 
Management Board member and the Management Board as 
a whole. Significant underperformance or overperformance 
in respect of these KPIs can result in reductions or increases 
of the profit share that is awarded to a Management Board 
member. 
Use of external market data
We monitor market developments to ensure that the 
remuneration package remains competitive. However, as our 
company profile is unique, and we are operating in a niche 
industry with a remuneration policy that is specifically 
tailored to unique dynamics, market comparisons are 
predominantly used as a second reference.
Scenario analyses carried out in respect of variable 
remuneration
The variable remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board is predominantly contingent upon 
a future, unknown, metric: the accrued firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool which itself depends on the operating 
result for the given financial year.
Because of the nature of our business activities and the 
fast-paced industry in which we operate, the Supervisory 
Board tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable remuneration 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year while 
performing a single, one-off, assessment at the end of the 
year as set out in the best practice provisions of the 
Corporate Governance Code. Half-yearly discussions take 
Remuneration for the Management Board
Introduction
The remuneration of, and other agreements with, 
the members of the Management Board are determined by 
the Supervisory Board (following a proposal by the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee). The Supervisory 
Board has assessed the remuneration of our Management 
Board members based on their performance - both 
individual and as a team- and the company performance in 
2021.

As shareholders have not approved to award actual shares, members of the Management Board receive share-like instruments.

Prior to their appointment into the Management Board, Chief Trading Officer Folkert Joling and Chief Technology Officer Thomas Wolff had participated in the Flow Traders Cash Incentive Plan 2017 (FCIP 2017). Under the FCIP plan rules they were offered the 
opportunity to buy Company shares and receive an annual cash incentive over a five-year period. The right to these incentives would have been forfeited due to ceasing to be an employee and becoming a member of the Management Board in April 2018. However, 
special permission has been granted to both Management Board members to remain entitled to the incentive rights under the FCIP plan rules in respect of the shares bought under the FCIP at the time they were an employee of Flow Traders rather than a member of 
the Management Board. As a result, they have both received €8,000 annual cash incentive.

◾
The more normalized market conditions and reduced 
operational profit translated into a significantly smaller 
variable remuneration pool in 2021 compared to 2020. 
The firm-wide variable remuneration pool in 2021 is 
35% of the operating profit. The Management Board 
has been awarded 6.1% of the variable remuneration 
pool in 2021.
	
◾
In line with the proposed cap on variable remuneration 
in the 2022 remuneration policy, the hard cap on 
variable remuneration for each Management Board 
member in 2021 is €4,066,000. The cap is based on 
average employee pay of €203,300, calculated 
according to the recommendation of the Dutch 
Monitoring Commission.
As shown below, variable remuneration for the Management 
Board saw a significant reduction in 2021 in comparison to 
2020. Despite the reduction, performance-based variable 
remuneration continues to be the key driver of 
compensation for the Management Board. 
results. While this structure is uncommon among listed 
companies, it is in line with the practice in our industry 
among both listed and non-listed peer companies, 
and necessary to be able to attract, retain and motivate 
individuals of highest caliber.
Total Management Board Remuneration 
	
◾
The more normalized conditions led to lower top line in 
2021 than 2020. We maintained a disciplined approach 
towards the cost side with the costs remaining within 
the guidance provided at the beginning of 2021. As a 
result, we achieved a strong EBITDA in 2021 of €159.4 
million (2020: €586.6 million). While we saw a reduction 
in the operational profit, 2021 was a successful year for 
Flow Traders. The Net Trading Income (NTI) achieved 
was the second highest in our history and we made 
significant progress in terms of executing our strategic 
growth agenda with the expansion into single bond 
market, broadening and deepening our digital assets 
and completing several strategic investments.
Base salary
None of the current members of the Management Board 
received any base salary increases during 2021. As such, 
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Trading Officer and Chief 
Technology Officer continue to receive an annual base 
salary of €94,608, while the Chief Risk Officer receives an 
annual base salary of €200,000. Mike Kuehnel was 
appointed as the Chief Financial Officer on 10 September 
2021 with an annual base salary of €94,608.
Variable remuneration
The design of our variable remuneration reflects our 
remuneration principles. We operate a single incentive plan 
that drives and rewards both annual and long-term 
performance with a significant focus on the long-term 
through the multi-year pay-out mechanism and half of the 
award being paid in Flow Traders equity. 
In line with our guiding principles, the members of the 
Management Board share in the same firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool as all other employees. This pool of 
variable remuneration is primarily a function of operating

Individual performance assessment
To determine individual variable remuneration awards, 
the Supervisory Board conducts a holistic assessment of the 
performance of each individual Management Board member 
and the Management Board as a whole. In this holistic 
performance assessment, the Supervisory Board takes into 
account performance on individual targets, which includes 
both financial and non-financial key performance indicators 
(KPIs). Objectives for these KPIs are set prior to the 
beginning of the year. Objectives are set for each individual 
Management Board member and the Management Board as 
a whole. 
Although performance on the KPIs is an important element 
of the holistic performance assessment, there is no 
formulaic relationship between performance on these KPIs 
and the variable remuneration award. However, significant 
underperformance or outperformance in respect of these 
objectives results in reductions or increases of the profit 
share that is awarded to a Management Board member.
Deferral and vesting
To ensure that the variable remuneration award of the 
Management Board is aligned with long-term value creation 
and shareholder experience, the Supervisory Board has 
decided to defer 50% of the 2021 award of the Management 
Board into share-like instruments. The remaining 50% is 
settled in cash, paid in 2022 and 2023. As shareholders have 
not approved awarding Flow Traders’ equity as part of the 
Management Board’s remuneration, we have utilized 
share-like instruments for the equity portion, which will be 
settled in cash at time of vesting. The value of these 
instruments is directly linked to Flow Traders’ share price 
development from time of grant to vesting.  Further, 
any outstanding variable remuneration (deferred or 
unvested) is at risk of being reduced or forfeited if Flow 
Traders incurs an operating loss. All equity-based awards are 
subject to a holding period of one year after vesting.
1.	
Individual KPIs
	
◾Individual KPIs were set for the Management Board 
members, tailored to their specific role and 
responsibilities. 
	
◾These included amongst others financial KPIs on Net 
Trading Income, product diversification and P/E ratio, 
and non-financial but quantifiable KPIs on 
operational performance, strategic agenda setting, 
organization development and role modeling desired 
leadership behaviors.
2.	
Assessing performance
	
◾Performance was assessed throughout the year by 
monitoring KPIs and discussions with the 
Management Board members themselves and the 
people they work with. 
	
◾Please see the following pages for the KPIs for each 
of the individual Management Board members.
3.	
Determining variable remuneration
	
◾Based on the financial results of the company, 
the resulting size of the pool available for the 
Management Board and the performance of the 
Management Board, both as individuals and as a 
team, the Supervisory Board has decided on this 
year’s variable remuneration.

a significant number of current and former employees 
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow Traders 
Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and Flow Traders Loyalty Incentive 
Plan (FLIP) were introduced. The FCIP was replaced in 2020 
by a new share plan which provides the award up to 50% of 
variable remuneration in shares (or share-like instruments).

Comparative overview of company performance and 
remuneration
The long-standing foundation of our policy is a relatively 
modest base salary and variable remuneration that is 
aligned with company performance – therefore varying 
considerably in successful and less successful (financial) 
years. This is clearly illustrated in the table below which 
shows the development of the company performance and 
the average (full-time) remuneration of executives and 
employees since Flow Traders’ IPO in 2015.

Supervisory Board Remuneration
The remuneration policy for the members of the 
Supervisory Board was adopted by the AGM on 23 April 2021 
and applied from that date onwards. The table below shows 
the total fixed compensation awarded to the individual 
members of the Supervisory Board.  As approved by the 
2021 AGM, committee members and committee chairs 
received separate fees for additional responsibilities and 
time commitment required for committee work in 2021. 
As such, the aggregate fees paid in 2021 have increased 
compared to previous years.
31 December 2021. We have not reserved nor accrued any 
amounts to cover pension claims or retirement claims. 
We do not provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
member of the Management Board.
Clawback variable remuneration
No variable remuneration has been clawed back during 2021. 
Temporary deviations from the remuneration policies
No temporary deviations took place from the respective 
policies in 2021.
Internal pay ratios
The 2021 pay ratio (CEO total pay vs average total employee 
pay) is 5.73 compared to 15.1 in 2020. While 2021 was a strong 
year for Flow Traders, the decrease is due to reduced 
operating profit in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by net 
trading income in 2021.
No pensions, loans and other benefits
In 2021, no personal loans, guarantees or the like were 
granted by the company to the members of the 
Management Board as part of their compensation package. 
No loans, guarantees or similar instruments to the members 
of the Management Board were outstanding on

We are also maintaining our FLIP (Flow Loyalty Incentive 
Plan) program, whereby we award company shares to 
employees marking their two-year anniversary with the 
company. Shares awarded under the FLIP are subject to 
a lock-up period and remain with the employee regardless 
of the termination of his or her employment with Flow 
Traders. All shares awarded to employees, are fully paid out 
from the variable compensation pool. The terms and 
conditions of the employee share plans are subject to review 
by the Management Board annually. As a part of these 
plans, shares have been and will be bought in the market.
Pension
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. At our 
headquarters in Amsterdam, we partner with a pension 
provider, giving employees the freedom of choice to select 
the option that best suits their individual needs while 
incentivizing participation in the company-sponsored 
program. In our other offices we offer schemes that are 
driven by country-specific practices and regulations. 
and appropriate behavior or was responsible for 
behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of the 
company’s position, in accordance with applicable law. 
	
◾
We do not award guaranteed variable remuneration to 
employees unless the guaranteed variable component 
is awarded in relation to hiring new staff, limited to the 
first year of employment, and only if we have a sound 
and strong capital base. 
	
◾
We do not award severance payments if there is a 
serious imputable act or negligence by the employee in 
the fulfilment of his or her function or where an 
employee resigns voluntarily (unless this is the 
consequence of a serious imputable act or negligence 
(ernstig verwijtbaar handelen of nalaten) by the 
company). 
	
◾
The company does not grant its employees any 
personal loans, guarantees or the like as part of their 
compensation package. We do not provide any other 
ancillary benefits for any employee. We have not 
reserved or accrued any amounts to cover pension 
claims or retirement claims.
Stimulating share ownership
One of our core values is ownership, and we mean it both in 
terms of mindset and behavior as well as literally. We believe 
that being a shareholder aligns the interests of the company 
with those of our employees. Ever since the company went 
public and before then, we have a history of offering our 
employees the opportunity to become a shareholder. Since 
2017 we promoted shareholding through the Flow Cash 
Incentive Plan (FCIP). From performance year 2020 we have 
started rewarding directly in company shares. The higher 
variable remuneration an individual receives, the higher is 
the proportion of variable pay paid out in shares.
Remuneration for other employees
Our performance cycle
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the beginning of 
each calendar year, clear objectives are set depending on an 
employee’s role, which are in line with our company 
objectives for the year and our corporate key competencies: 
drive, ownership and teamwork. Performance is reviewed 
two times a year. 
Individual variable remuneration payable from the collective 
variable compensation pool is dependent on company and 
business unit performance, individual performance and the 
individual’s contribution to the long-term success of the 
company as a whole, discouraging a culture of ‘star’ behavior 
and fostering collaboration and teamwork. Flow Traders 
does not base variable remuneration directly on financial 
results achieved individually. The Supervisory Board 
approves the awarding of variable remuneration.
If awarded, variable remuneration is paid in cash and 
company shares in one, two, three or four annual 
instalments, depending on the amount of variable 
remuneration awarded. The deferred variable component 
acts as a first loss tranche to compensate for any operating 
loss in the subsequent year, acting as a buffer before such 
loss would impact shareholder equity. This serves as an 
important incentive for risk-aware behavior, keeping in mind 
the long-term objectives of the company and alignment 
with our risk appetite. We deem the deferral period 
sufficient given the company’s risk profile and horizon. 
	
◾
Variable remuneration components may become 
subject to reduction or claw back if it is determined that 
the relevant employee or member of the Management 
Board did not meet adequate norms of competence

reviewed these guidelines and have already determined 
that we are largely compliant with these guidelines, and as 
such, any impact on us will be minor. Nonetheless, we 
continuously are vigilant for any new changes as they may 
have a significant impact on the General Remuneration 
Policy, our global remuneration model and other 
remuneration practices of the company and its group 
companies. It may also impact our ability to attract or retain 
talent given the global and highly competitive nature of our 
industry.
Variable compensation granted
In 2021, the total amount of variable remuneration awarded 
to all employees including members of the Management 
Board was €80.6 million (2020: €256.5 million). 
In 2021, companywide average compensation paid per 
employee was approximately €269,400, while variable 
remuneration amounted to around 65 percent of total 
compensation in 2021. In 2021, 16 employees, including the 
Management Board, were awarded remuneration of €1 
million or more (2020: 66).

Changes in regulation
Remuneration regulations are subject to change. 
For example, as of 22 November 2021, the European 
Banking Authority published a final report, setting out the 
“Guidelines on sound remuneration policies under Directive 
(EU) 2019/2034” which are applicable to investment firms, 
such as ours from 30 April 2022. These guidelines are 
intended to implement sound and gender neutral 
remuneration policies for all staff with specific provisions 
applying for certain identified staff. For such identified staff, 
the guidelines emphasizes that their variable remuneration 
is aligned with the investment firm’s risk profile. We have

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1.	
Reporting entity
Flow Traders N.V. (referred to as the ‘Company’) is a public limited liability company (naamloze 
vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its seat (statutaire 
zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, having its registered office at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 
1018 LL Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Trade Register of the Chamber of 
Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, afdeling Handelsregister) under number 34294936.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). 
The Group is a leading technology-enabled global multi-asset class liquidity provider with its 
core business in Exchange Traded Products (ETP) actively expanding in fixed income, FX, 
commodities and digital assets, while systemically increasing its presence in the global 
ecosystem through strategic partnerships and investments.
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the annual period ended 31 December 
2021 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders N.V., its subsidiaries and associates. 
The annual financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company’s Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board on 3 March 2022 subject to adoption by the General Meeting 
of shareholders.
2.	 Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption.
3.	 Basis of preparation 
a)	
Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (‘IFRS-EU’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS-EU provides several options in 
accounting principles. The Group’s accounting principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding 
the options available are set out in the section ‘Significant accounting policies’ below.
b)	
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except 
for the following items and unless otherwise indicated:
	
◾
financial assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with changes 
recognized in profit or loss; 
	
◾
other assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with changes 
recognized in profit or loss;
	
◾
investments measured at fair value through OCI are measured at fair value with changes in 
fair value recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses which 
are recognized in profit or loss;
	
◾
investments measured at fair value through PL are measured at fair value with changes in 
fair value recognized in profit and loss.
c)	
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the functional 
currency of the parent company: Flow Traders N.V.. All financial information presented in euros 
has been rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
d)	
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to form opinions and make 
estimates and assumptions that influence the reported value of assets and liabilities and of 
income and expenditure. The actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are constantly assessed. Revisions of estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. For more details, we refer you to 
the chapter on Fair values of financial instruments, other assets and liabilities and share based 
payments. The accounting treatment of all aspects of the digitals assets and blockchain 
industry have not yet been addressed by current IFRS guidance. The Company is required to 
make significant assumptions and judgments as to its accounting policies and the application 
thereof, which are disclosed in the note 6 New standards and interpretations, note 7  fair values 
of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities held  for trading and note 31 financial 
risk management to these consolidated financial statements. If specific guidance is enacted by 
the IASB in the future, the impact may result in changes to the company financial position as 
currently presented.

subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date when control ceases. 
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.
Investments in associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or 
joint control, over its financial and operating activities. Control or significant influence follows 
from facts and circumstances, but there is a rebuttable presumption that significant influence 
when the Group holds between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting power of another 
entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized 
initially at cost. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, 
the carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part 
thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair 
value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
e)	
Principles for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows
The cash flow from operating activities of the consolidated statement of cash flows is based on 
the indirect method, the cash flow from investing and financing of the consolidated statement 
of cash flows is based on the direct method.
The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, including trading activities, investment 
activities and financing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash flow from operating activities. The Group has elected to classify interest 
received and interest paid (including interest on lease liabilities and interest arising from 
revenue contracts, if there is any) as cash flows from operating activities. Investment activities 
are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments other 
than in the course of operations, as well as acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates, 
property and equipment. Financing activities include the payment of dividend to shareholders, 
the (re)-purchase of shares, the issuance and repayment of financial debt, including financial 
lease liabilities, and capital contributions.
4.	 Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
a)	
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group entities.
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from 
intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated 
against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee if it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. The financial statements of

c)	
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three 
months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
d)	
Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are originated. 
All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) 
are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or minus, for an item 
not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its 
acquisition or issue.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
	
◾
trading receivables, measured at fair value through profit and loss;
	
◾
investments measured at fair value through OCI;
	
◾
investments measured at fair value through PL;
	
◾
financial assets held for trading at fair value through profit or loss; and
	
◾
other financial assets at amortized costs.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan 
commitments, into the following categories:
	
◾
trading payables, measured at fair value through profit and loss;
	
◾
financial liabilities held for trading at fair value through profit or loss; and
	
◾
other financial liabilities measured at amortized costs.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group acquires or incurs 
principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of 
a portfolio that is managed together for short-term profit.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any gain or loss 
resulting from the fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration is recognized in profit 
or loss.
b)	
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of the respective 
entities of the Group at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the foreign currency 
difference recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising on the translation of investments 
measured at fair value through OCI are recognized in other comprehensive income unless the 
instrument is impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at 
fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based 
on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. 
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euros at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in 
the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of equity. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, 
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclas­
sified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

Other financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes 
a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated 
with its capital contributions to the United States and Singapore subsidiaries. Gains or losses on 
the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI 
while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of 
profit or loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or 
losses recorded in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of offset is agreed 
between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS-EU, 
for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading 
activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at 
that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market 
for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the 
transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group 
Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value in 
the statement of financial position, with transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. All 
changes in fair value are recognized as part of net trading income in profit or loss. Trading 
assets and liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition.
Trading receivables and payables
Such assets are recognized initially at fair value with any directly attributable transaction costs 
recognized in profit or loss. 
Investments measured at fair value through OCI
Investments measured at fair value through OCI are non-derivative financial assets that the 
Group considers long-term investments of strategic relevance for the growth of the company. 
Investments measured at fair value through OCI are recognized initially at fair value. 
Transaction costs are recognized in other comprehensive income as part of the change in fair 
value at the next remeasurement and they are never reclassified into profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other 
than foreign currency differences on fair value through OCI instruments, are recognized in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an 
investment is derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit 
or loss.
Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss
Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss are non-derivative financial assets 
that the group holds for long term trading purposes. Investments measured at fair value 
through profit and loss are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in 
the profit and loss as part of the change in fair value, any re-measurement of the investments 
is classified to profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, 
are recognized in profit and loss. When an investment is derecognized, the gain or loss is 
classified to profit or loss.

reference prices from multiple crypto exchanges and active markets for the mark-to-market 
treatment. If assets are not actively traded than the valuation is based upon quoted prices or 
observable inputs from similar assets per crypto exchange.  Given the IFRS 13 requirements and 
our current pricing & fair value models used for the valuation of our other assets-held-for-
trading and other liabilities-for-trading these are recognized as Level 2 Fair Values.
f)	
Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. 
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as the difference 
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognized in 
profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over 
the estimated useful lives of each component. 
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant items of 
property and equipment are as follows:
	
◾
hardware: 5 years;
	
◾
office fixtures: 5 years;
	
◾
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date 
and adjusted if appropriate. 
determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the 
fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or 
liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, 
then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, 
that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market 
data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on theoretical prices whereby the price 
differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those theoretical prices can differ 
from quoted market prices. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department monitors whether all 
differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the Group on the basis 
of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price 
that would be received to sell a net long position or paid to transfer a net short position for 
a particular risk exposure. 
Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the 
reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e)	
Other assets Held for Trading
The Other assets Held for trading comprises the amount of digital assets that the group holds 
as a broker-trader. The group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets and these are measured at fair 
value through profit and loss. 
As a global market maker in digital assets determining the fair value and pricing of these assets 
is core to our business model. Providing our bid-ask prices to other market participants is 
impacting the principal markets. All digital assets positions in our Trading Book relate to very 
short-term holding periods and are based upon our business model in which trading positions 
are economically hedged. For the determination of the fair value, the group constantly collects

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2021 123
Impairment losses on investments measured at fair value through OCI are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and do not reduce the carrying value of the investment.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the 
recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
For other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs as these 
receivables relate to operating activities of the Group. Therefore, the Group does not track 
changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit 
loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic 
environment. 
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a financial asset to be in default when 
internal or external information indicated that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding 
contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the 
Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the 
contractual cash flows.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is 
recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., 
the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, 
less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeas­
urement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease 
liabilities recognized less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease 
term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Right-of-use assets are recorded in 
property and equipment and intangible assets on the statement of financial position.
g)	
Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the estimated 
useful lives of each component. The estimated useful life of significant intangible assets is 
5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognized and in subsequent years measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of equity-accounted investees is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-
accounted investee as a whole.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
h)	
Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and other debt 
financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee 
contracts, in this section all referred to as ‘financial instruments’, is based on the credit losses 
expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless 
there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, 
the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL).

which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for 
a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and 
end of that period. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair 
value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service 
requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are 
reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless 
there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not 
been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
The fair value of share appreciation rights (SARs) granted to employees, which are cash-settled, 
is recognized in employee expenses, together with a corresponding increase in other liabilities, 
over the period during which the service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The liability 
is remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any 
changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Estimates used are reassessed at the end of 
each reporting period.
Share based payments have a dilutive effect on earnings per share (refer to note 8). 
k)	
Other liabilities Held for Trading 
As part of its trading activities, the Company enters into digital asset payables. The borrowed 
digital assets payables are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
l)	
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed 
reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU 
(group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no 
impairment loss had been recognized.
i)	
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash variable 
compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
j)	
Share based payments
The fair value of equity-settled transactions granted to employees is determined by the fair 
value of the shares at the date when the grant is made. When employees render services as 
consideration for equity instruments, the expense is recognized in employee expenses, 
together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which 
the service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The awards vest in tranches on various 
dates over a total period of three to five years. Vesting is conditional upon the employee being 
actively employed by the Group on the vesting date. If the employee is terminated or resigns, 
any unvested tranches of the award will be forfeited. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to

tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any 
withholding tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
	
◾
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss; 
	
◾
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in the foreseeable future; and
	
◾
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the 
impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. 
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based 
on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and management 
judgement. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause the Group to 
change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities or the collectability of 
tax assets. Such changes will impact tax expense in the period that such a change in estimate is 
made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or 
the tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognized as finance cost. 
m)	 Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities on the 
statement of financial position measured at the present value of lease payments to be made 
over the lease term. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the 
incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. After the commencement date, 
the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for 
the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if 
there is a change in the lease term or in case of other reassessments or modifications. 
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., 
those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do 
not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
n)	
Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial expenses 
related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and are therefore 
directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading income.
o)	
Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized 
in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items recognized 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to

5.	 Operating segments
The management board examines the group performance from a regional perspective and has 
identified three reportable segments of its global trading business: Europe, the Americas and 
Asia. Europe consists of the activities in the Netherlands with branches for institutional trading 
in France, UK, Italy and IT activities in Romania. Americas consists of the subsidiaries in the USA. 
Asia contains our subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore. The management board considers 
this segmentation to be relevant to understand the group financial performance because it 
allows investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate the 
operating performance and decision making about allocation of resources and trading capital. 
The group measures results on IFRS basis and reconciles the total segment results on net 
trading income, profit before tax and net profit. Significant transactions and balances between 
geographic regions occur primarily as result of group operating companies incurring the 
operating expenses such as employee compensation, communication, software development 
and data processing and overhead costs for the purpose of providing services to affiliated 
operating companies (line items intercompany recharge income and expenses).
The Group’s trading assets and liabilities attributable to each segment are reported to 
management on the basis of net liquidity. Consequently, the reported total assets in each 
segment are net of the segment’s financial liabilities held for trading, trading payables and 
other liabilities held for trading. The Group’s capital expenditures include additions to property, 
equipment and intangible assets as set out in notes 21 and 22.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
p)	
Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognized at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the 
carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in the share premium.
q)	
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental 
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs 
and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sale will be withdrawn. Management must be 
committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year 
from the date of the classification.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the 
statement of financial position.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either 
has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and is part of a single coordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.

7.	 Fair values of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities held for trading
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the 
following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in 
determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
Valuation models 
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the 
price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly 
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date. 
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are 
based on prices obtained directly from an exchange on which the instruments are traded or 
obtained from a broker that provides an unadjusted quoted price from an active market for 
identical instruments. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values 
using other valuation techniques. 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, depending on the 
inputs used for making the measurements.
	
◾
Level 1: fair value of financial instruments based upon inputs that are quoted, unadjusted, 
market prices in active markets for identical instruments;
	
◾
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes 
instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; 
quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not considered active; 
or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly 
observable from market data;
	
◾
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the 
valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a significant effect on the 
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valuated based on 
quoted prices for similar instruments but for which significant unobservable adjustments 
or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments, for example 
unlisted equity securities.
The Group uses widely recognized valuation techniques and models for determining the fair 
value of common, simple financial instruments that use only observable market data and 
6.	 New standards and interpretations
New accounting policy: Digital assets and liabilities
All accounting policies are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021 except for the accounting for digital 
assets. The Group has decided, based on the materiality of the digital assets in the 2021 
financial statements to develop an accounting policy for digital assets and liabilities based on 
the IFRS Interpretation Committee guidelines on the accounting of cryptocurrencies (July 2019). 
This change mainly affects the presentation of the assets and liabilities, since the valuation has 
not changed compared to prior years. This change is applied retrospectively, therefore the 
comparative numbers have been restated. Management has assessed that for the holding of 
digital assets the Group acts as a broker-trader and applies IAS 2 – inventories held for sale in 
the normal course of business. IAS 2 requires the measurement of inventories at fair value less 
costs to sell. The accounting for derivatives in relation to digital assets and stablecoins remains 
unchanged within financial assets and liabilities held for trading. This has resulted in balance 
sheet reclassifications from financial assets and liabilities held for trading and trading 
receivables and payables to other assets and liabilities held for. This has resulted in additional 
disclosures in note 4 significant accounting policies, note 7 fair values of financial instruments 
and other assets and liabilities held  for trading and note 31 financial risk management. 
The Group has made assumptions and judgements relating to its accounting policy of digital 
assets and liabilities and the application thereof, given the limited specific guidance in IFRS. 
Future developments by the IASB may impact the current accounting as applied by the Group.
Restatement of prior period error
For our 31 December 2020 financials the IAS 32 netting rules in respect of amounts due from 
brokers and borrowings from brokers were incorrectly applied. As a result € 139 million of 
balances due from brokers was reclassified from trading payables to trading receivables, 
resulting in an increase of trading receivables as well as trading payables with € 139 million as 
per 31 December 2020. The balance sheet reclassification has resulted in a restatement of the 
cash flow statement, the (increase)/decrease trading receivables cash outflow increased with 
€ 139 million and the increase/(decrease) trading payables cash inflow increased with the same 
amount. There is no impact on the profit and loss accounts and no impact on the financial 
statement for 2021.
Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2021, but do not have 
an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2021 129
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are carried at fair 
value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted market prices. 
The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused by the fact that the Group 
continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities based on all available information. 
This includes prices for identical and near-identical positions, as well as the prices for securities 
underlying the Group’s positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on 
which the financial asset or liability is primarily traded closes. The Group’s Risk and Operations 
department checks the theoretical price independently. As part of their review, they monitor 
whether all price adjustments can be substantiated with market inputs. Consequently, 
such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to determine fair 
value. 
b)	
Trading receivables and payables
These items are valued at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition and changes in 
fair value recognized in profit or loss as they arise. In accordance with the Group Accounting 
Policy of trade-date accounting for regular-way sale and purchase transactions, sales/
purchase transactions awaiting settlement represent amounts receivable/payable for 
securities sold/purchased but not yet settled as at the reporting date. Receivables from and 
payables to broker-dealers, including cash balances held at the Group’s clearing firms and the 
net amount receivable or payable for securities transactions pending settlement are included 
in this category. The group maintains portfolio financing facilitates with its prime brokers to 
facilitate its trading activities to finance the purchase and settlement of financial instruments. 
These Financial liabilities are included at amortized cost. Gains, and losses, including on 
derecognition, interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit 
or loss.
c)	
Investments measured at fair value through OCI
The fair value of Investments measured at fair value through OCI is determined by reference to 
their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation 
technique and are classified as Level 2 or level 3, conditional upon the regular availability of 
quoted closing bid prices.
require little management judgement and estimation. Observable prices or model inputs used 
in valuation techniques include risk-free and benchmark interest rates and credit spreads used 
in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity 
and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and correlations, which are usually 
available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives and 
simple over-the-counter derivatives. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs 
reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and thus reduces the uncertainty 
associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable market prices and inputs 
varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific 
events and general conditions in the financial markets.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in determining appropriate portfolio-level 
adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask 
spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. 
Similarly, when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the 
basis of net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, it takes into account any 
existing arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements 
with the counterparty).
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair 
values. This framework involves both the Risk and Operations department which are 
independent of the Trading department and report directly to the CRO who is a member of the 
Management Board. The Risk and Operations department have overall responsibility for 
independently verifying the results of trading and all significant fair value measurements. 
The daily reconciliation of the positions and prices between the prime brokers and the Trading 
department is most important.
a)	
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The valuation of trading positions, both the long and the short positions, is determined by 
reference to last traded prices from identical instruments from the exchanges at the reporting 
date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.

d)	
Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss
The fair value of Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss is determined by 
reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined 
using a valuation technique and are classified as Level 3.
e)	
Other assets Held for Trading 
The Company’s digital assets are primarily traded in active markets and are purchased with the 
intent to resell in the near future, generating a profit from the fluctuations in prices or margins, 
as the company uses its own fair value models based on quoted prices or observable inputs for 
the valuation of the digit assets, these assets are classified as Level 2.
f)	
Other liabilities held for trading
From time to time, the Company borrows digital assets as part of its trading strategy. 
The borrowed digital assets payables are measured at Fair Value through profit or loss, as the

Hedge of net investments in foreign operations 
Included in financial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2021 was a borrowing of 
USD 37 million which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United 
States and Singapore subsidiaries, which have their functional currencies in USD. This borrowing 
is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign exchange risk on these 
investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to OCI to 
offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the 
net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the USD 
borrowing. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging 
instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise when 
the amount of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the amount of the 
borrowing.

8.	 Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on profit for the year attributable to 
ordinary shareholders and the number of ordinary shares outstanding. 
The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted average effect of 
changes in treasury shares during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the basic earnings per share for the 
effects of all dilutive share-based payments to employees.

9.	 Net trading income
Gross trading income comprises the realized and unrealized income on financial instruments, 
digital assets and certain fees which the group receives as a liquidity provider from exchanges 
and issuers of products.
Fees related to the trading activities consist of expenses such as exchange fees, clearing fees 
and other trading related fees. Net financial expenses related to the trading activities mainly 
relate to interest expense on the credit facilities with the prime brokers calculated on the 
drawn amount during the year.

The wages and salaries increased in line with the FTE development from 554 as per 
31 December 2020 to 613 as per 31 December 2021. Overall employee expenses declined by 
43% as a result of the decrease in variable compensation paid to employees. The decrease in 
variable compensation is also reflected in the decrease in other liabilities. The amount of 
variable compensation payable is based on the operational profit of the company. 
The amounts recognized in profit and loss during 2021 do not fully reconcile with the 
remuneration report due to the deferred recognition of expenses in future years due to the 
service condition element of the employee share plans.
Share-based payments
The company awards its employees with shares based on their loyalty, sign-on package or as 
part of their variable compensation. The shares awarded under the 2019, company loyalty and 
sign-on package share plans are awarded based on a net basis, which entails that the company 
is liable for the employee income tax due for these plans. Shares awards under the 2020 or 
2021 share plan are gross awards, which entails that the employee income tax obligations are to 
be paid out of these awards. 
In either case the Group is responsible for withholding wage taxes upon vesting in the 
Netherlands and in most other countries of operations. The estimated amount of wage taxes 
can be up to 50% in the Netherlands, for which future cash outflows are covered by the selling 
of part of the Treasury Shares kept in the Share Premium Account.

of variable compensation to certain employees. The shares vest over a period of three to five 
years, depending on the share plan and agreement with the employee, subject to the condition 
that the employee remains employed on the vesting date.

company awarded employees shares based on a fixed monetary value of €0.6 million, 
reflecting a weighted average fair value of shares granted of €32.51 (2020: €27.26). The exercise 
price of the share option is equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of 
grant.

The deferred tax asset mainly relates to US temporary differences in the deductibility of the 
variable compensation instalments.
The effective tax rate differs from the (nominal) statutory tax rate. This difference is mainly 
caused by applying the participation exemption and Dutch innovation box regime. In addition 
the effective tax rate is impacted by non-deductible share plan costs that occur in each region.

The investments of the Group in various exchanges, through participations or “member seats”, 
are classified as investments measured at fair value through OCI. Member seats provide access 
to various exchanges. These investments are measured at fair value determined on the last 
available bid before year end in the foreign currencies which are translated to euros at 
exchange rates at the reporting date. The price movements are related to the fair value 
updates for the investment in ErisX (Eris Digital Holding LLC) and MEMX. On October 20,

Borrowings
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to facilitate the trading 
activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of financial instruments). The drawn 
amounts on these facilities continuously fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given 
moment.
The Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities with ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V. 
(AACB ), totalling € 2,825 million per year end, comprising of a EUR denominated facility of 
€ 2,350 million and a USD denominated facility of $ 540 million. In addition, the Group entered 
into interest-bearing credit facilities for portfolio margin financing with Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch (BA ML), NatWest Markets, Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank and 
Sova Capital. These facilities can be modified or terminated at any time. The facilities are 
exclusively for the financing of positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary 
course of the trading activities using the various prime brokers.
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin requirements 
(representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is variable and calculated on a daily 
basis depending on portfolio size and composition) in cash or securities as security for our 
positions held with the relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities, the Group is required to comply with 
a net liquidation balance that exceeds the haircut calculated by the prime broker. Both the net 
liquidation balance and haircut are variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on 
portfolio size and composition. The main covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to 
loan size (variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio composition). 
In addition, they require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%, calculated by 
shareholders equity divided by credit limit.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with financial 
statements and other information, including information on our trading activities and trading 
counterparties, and permission to inspect our books and records. Furthermore, they require us 
to maintain all relevant authorizations and memberships required in order to conduct our 
Goodwill
In December 2010 the Group obtained control of TradeSense Solutions B.V. and its subsidiary 
Flow Traders Technologies SRL (formerly TradeSense Solutions SRL), a software development 
company with special focus on trading in electronic markets. The goodwill amounted to 
€ 0.5 million.
There were no additions or impairments to the goodwill in 2021 and 2020.

As from 2020 certain employees receive part of their variable compensation in share 
appreciation rights (SARs). The SARs vest in equal instalments over a period of four to five years 
subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on the vesting date. The SARS 
are expenses and recognized in the financial statements in line with the IFRS 2 Share based 
payment - cash settled accounting rules (refer also to note 10 - Employee Expenses). 
The contingent liability from these plans are as follows:
Cash incentive provided to employees
Up until and including 2019, employees had the possibility to participate in an employee 
incentive plan and are eligible to a cash incentive depending on their share position in the 
company. One of the conditions for this cash incentive is that the employee needs to be 
employed at the company at time of the payment of the cash incentive. Payments will be made 
in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth year of the plan. Based on IAS 19, costs related to the 
cash incentive may not be recognized until the employee fulfils the service obligation. 
Therefore these costs will be recognized in future years in profit and loss. In 2021 the company 
recognized €2.3 million of costs relating to this plan (2020: €2.6 million).

Flow Traders Foundation
As some of Flow Traders’ Supervisory Board members sit on the board of the Flow Traders 
Foundation (“Foundation”), the foundation is considered a related party. 
In 2020 Flow Traders established the Flow Traders Foundation, a Charity or Foundation 
(“Stichting”) to better structure its historic engagement in giving to others in society who need 
(financial) help. During 2020 Flow Traders has put in place the funding to make sure that 
a significant financial basis has been laid so that the Foundation has the financial means to 
make not only an annual but also a structural impact and meets its purpose.
In 2021 Flow Traders contributed a total value of €0.6 million (2020: €0.2 million) related to the 
Multiyear right to appoint charities the Foundation supports as the main shirt sponsor of 
a Dutch professional football club and €0.4 million of the 2021 cash bonus reserved for 
employees will be donated to the Flow Traders Foundation in 2022 (2020: nil). Furthermore, 
60,000 Flow Traders NV shares for a total value of €2.0 million and a cash donation of €0.5 
million were transferred to the Foundation. These transfers were already accrued for in 2020. 
In 2020 Flow Traders made contributions to the Foundation for a total value of €10 million.

Significant restrictions
The Group does not have significant restrictions on its ability to access or use its assets and 
settle its liabilities other than those resulting from the supervisory frameworks within which its 
subsidiaries operate. Please refer to the Capital Management section of this report for more 
information.
31.	 Financial risk management
Overview
The Group is exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
	
◾
Operational risk;
	
◾
Credit risk;
	
◾
Market risk;
	
◾
Foreign Exchange risk;
	
◾
Interest Rate risk;
	
◾
Liquidity risk;
	
◾
Concentration risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the 
Group’s management of capital.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people 
and systems or from external events.
Our Group Operational Risk framework contributes to raise awareness of these risks to all our 
employees and stimulates a risk mitigation culture in all our processes that are well 
documented and periodically updated. The risk governance and independent organization of 
the Risk team ensures that the risk appetite is appropriately implemented, monitored and 
reported to Management on a regular basis. We maintain an internal operational risk event 
database that captures any incident that may have occurred (irrespective if it led to a financial 
loss/profit or not). We routinely perform an in-depth analysis of these incidents in order to 
avoid a reoccurrence. Every year, we conduct Risk Control Self Assessments (RCSA) in every 
team to update the main inherent risks that could be the most impactful and ensure they 
remain within our risk appetite. Any deviation is escalated to Management and a Taskforce is 
put in place to bring back the residual risk scoring within our risk appetite. This ongoing vigilance 
ensures we dedicate the appropriate amount of time and resources to improve our control 
environment in a consistent way.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the settlement of 
off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. These amounts 
significantly exceed expected loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes 
into account the likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of 
counterparty default is deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
and the central counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was 
as follows:
CARRYING AMOUNT
At 31 December
2021
2020
Cash and cash equivalents
 4,949 
 8,345 
Trading receivables
 6,160,238 
 4,633,469 
Other receivables
 14,727 
 14,190 
Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are guaranteed by the 
central counterparty or clearing house related to that exchange. Members of these clearing 
houses are required to deposit substantial amounts of cash, bonds or equities as collateral for 
any failure to settlement of trading. While still a limited part of our business, there is an 
inherent risk related to transactions on digital assets exchanges as they are generally 
unregulated. This risk is mitigated by strict onboarding procedures and limiting the value traded 
on exchange to minimize the maximum risk.

The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can receive and grant 
collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in respect of the following 
transactions:
	
◾
derivatives;
	
◾
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
	
◾
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities as set 
out in notes 15 and 24 in respect of derivatives (including swaps). Such collateral is subject to 
standard industry terms including, where appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This 
means that securities received/granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of 
the transaction, but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give 
each party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure to post 
collateral.
Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to manage the 
associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include: securities borrowing and lending 
arrangements, and over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives. These netting 
agreements and similar arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set-off liabilities 
against available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event of the 
counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or otherwise eliminate, 
all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount receivable from the same 
counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit exposure. However, the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 
are not met in all cases.
The Group manages credit risk through its Risk and Mid-Office department that provide 
specific guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit risk.
Policies include amongst others:
	
◾
limits for individual product types;
	
◾
limits per counterparty;
	
◾
limits on the duration of the exposure;
	
◾
limits for settlement types;
	
◾
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty exposures are 
monitored on an intra-day basis.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial liabilities that:
	
◾
are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
	
◾
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that 
covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase 
agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. Similar financial instruments 
include derivatives, sales and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase 
agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, 
such as loans and deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the 
statement of financial position. This is because they create a right to offset recognized 
amounts for the parties to the agreement that is enforceable only following an event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties or following other 
predetermined events.
In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net basis or to realize 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial instrument 
fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, 
volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and equity prices. The Risk and 
Mid-Office department monitors market risk exposure on a continuous basis (including 
intra-day). Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated risk for the Group, limit 
breaches, if any, will trigger action from the Risk and Mid-Office department in order to reduce 
the risk.
In addition to the Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily. The applicable haircut and margins are computed by the Group’s prime 
brokers. The Risk and Mid-Office department computes the haircut using internal models 
enabling intra-day monitoring. Limits are set on both capital- and credit usage. Long and short 
trading positions include securities and derivatives such as: shares, American depositary 
receipts (ADR s), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRA s), exchange-traded 
products (ETP) and digital assets. All traded financial instruments are liquid instruments. 
Therefore, the portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame and with limited 
costs.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize the risk for market movements and 
does not engage in long and/or short only positions. The direction of market movements, i.e. 
what the Group considers directional market risk, is not relevant for the Group because of this 
long/short trading strategy. Because of the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.

balance sheet. All positions carried on the balance sheet are short term and listed on 
exchanges and therefore liquid and tradable.
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility available to 
facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the balance sheet. In order to match the 
liquidity and short holding period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate 
payable, which is floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact 
that the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short positions and 
in the EFP of the future.
Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as the Group’s 
investments in investments measured at fair value through OCI. In addition, for its option 
positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk factor. Other 
factors to consider are time and dividend expectations.
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual positions per 
product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the size of the exposure, concen­
trations, pricing and valuation parameters and natural hedging between these long and short 
positions.
As the Group is active in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in 
underlying values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and margins are computed 
by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis measures all positions, individual and 
correlated, and reflects the different risk components. The third party haircut calculation 
confirms the internal assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is 
exposed to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under Market risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and 
settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are captured in the risk 
and margin requirements which the Group is required to post at its prime brokers and clearing 
firms. The consolidated margin and haircut requirements over 2021 are shown in the Capital 
management paragraph. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk close to zero 
remains as a result of inefficiencies in the models of the prime brokers.
Market risk factors relating to digital assets and liabilities
In a similar matter to traditional assets, the price of a digital asset or liability fluctuates 
according to its supply and demand. We manage this risk by holding digital assets in the same 
proportion as liabilities (long/short delta neutral book). Per year end we had a total exposure to 
digital assets of € 0.4 million (2020 € 0.5 million).

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the euro, but also 
United States dollars and Singapore dollars.
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well as net results 
of these foreign operations during the year.
The Group manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency.
The Group does use financial instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net 
investments in foreign operations or net results of foreign operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial instruments. The Group 
is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches of arranged interest rates of assets 
and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These 
limits ensure that interest rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and 
hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. All 
financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair value on the

Concentration Risk
Concentration risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business 
activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that 
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in 
economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the 
Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic location. 
The Group’s policies and procedures and the broad geographic and industry spread of its 
activities limit its exposure to any concentration risk. Additionally management has established 
credit limits for geographic and counterparty exposures, which are monitored on a daily basis. 
We monitor the distribution of assets and off-balance sheet items by geographic region and 
industry sector on an ongoing basis.

Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the prime brokers 
through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well as cash generated from our 
operating activities. As of 31 December 2021, the Group held € 4.9 million in cash and cash 
equivalents compared to € 8.3 million as of 31 December 2020. These balances are maintained 
primarily to support operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient 
short-term access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.
The Group maintains a highly liquid balance sheet, with a large portion of its total assets 
consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable securities and short-term trading receivables 
(arising from securities transactions).
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intra-day basis and maintains significant 
portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to facilitate trading. These facilities 
are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as well as all financial assets in accounts held at the 
respective prime brokers. The Group has no outstanding borrowings other than the portfolio 
financing facilities with prime brokers.
Capital management
Objectives and processes of managing capital
The management board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base well above the required 
margin in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The management board monitors the regulatory capital and 
prime broker margin requirements ratio’s consolidated and for its key regions, the return on its 
capital as well as the level of dividend to its shareholders. The process of allocation capital to 
different regions and activities is subject to review to the Risk Committee. 
Regulatory Capital
Capital adequacy and the use of required regulatory capital are based on the guidelines 
developed by Investment Firm Regulation and Investment Firm EU Directives (IFR/IFD). 
The group’s lead regulator, the Dutch Central Bank, sets and monitors capital requirements for 
the group as a whole and for the operating company. In addition, the activities of our subsid­
iaries in the USA and APAC are supervised by their local regulators. The Dutch Central Bank 
adopted the IFR/IFD capital requirements as from June 26, 2021. As part of the IFR/IFD Capital 
Requirements Flow Traders NV is categorized as Category II Investment Firm and applying 
K-factor risk model, fixed overhead costs and minimum capital requirements as the Pillar I 
requirements. The Dutch Central bank on top of Pillar I has set additional Pillar II capital 
requirements. 
The group and its individually regulated subsidiaries have complied with all externally imposed 
capital requirements.

Notes to the parent company financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the determination
of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and 
determination of the result for its parent Company financial statements, the Group applies the 
option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the 
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result 
(hereinafter referred to as principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent company 
financial statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS -EU financial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has significant influence, 
are measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated statements chapter 1 to 4 for 
a description of the Group’s IFRS -EU principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Company’s share in the results of these 
participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the transfer of assets and liabilities 
between (i) the Group and its participating interests on (ii) between participating interests 
themselves, are not recognized.

approval of the Supervisory Board, that a distribution on shares shall not take place as a 
cash payment but as a payment in shares, or decide that holders of shares shall have the 
option to receive a distribution as a cash payment and/or as a payment in shares, out of the

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Our 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders N.V. (hereinafter also referred to as the company or Flow 
Traders) in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory 
audit of public-interest entities, the “Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties” (Wta, Audit firms 
supervision act), the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-
opdrachten” (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to 
independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore 
we have complied with the “Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, 
Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion 
and any findings were addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or 
conclusion on these matters.
Our understanding of the business
Flow Traders N.V. is a global financial technology-enabled multi-asset class liquidity provider 
with its core business in Exchange Traded Products (ETP), which includes fixed income, FX, 
digital assets (cryptocurrencies) and commodities. Flow Traders N.V. is at the head of a group of 
entities. The group is structured in components and we tailored our group audit approach 
accordingly. We paid specific attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by the nature of 
the group and our risk assessment.  
We start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to design audit 
procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2021 166
We have: 
	
◾
Performed audit procedures ourselves for the group entity Flow Traders B.V.
	
◾
Used the work of another (non-EY) auditor for auditing the group entity Flow Traders U.S. 
LLC
	
◾
Used other EY audit firms to perform specific audit procedures at other group entities
We sent instructions to component auditors, covering the significant areas and the information 
required to be reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, we determined the level of 
involvement in component audits. Because of the continuing travel restrictions and social 
distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our site visit for the component team in the US was 
virtual and encompassed some, or all, of the following activities: reviewing key local working 
papers and conclusions, videoconferencing with local management teams and obtaining an 
understanding of key processes. We interacted regularly with the US and other component 
teams during various stages of the audit, through the use of videoconferencing facilities. 
By performing the procedures mentioned above at components of the group, together with 
additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate 
audit evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the consol­
idated financial statements. 
Teaming, use of specialists 
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the 
appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in the 
business of providing liquidity to financial markets. We included specialists in the areas of IT 
audit, forensics, tax and transfer pricing and have made use of our own experts in the areas of 
valuations of trading positions, digital assets (crypto currencies) and actuaries.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be 
expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to 
obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Materiality
Materiality
€7.3 million (2020: €28.6 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of profit before tax (rounded)
Explanation
We applied profit before tax as this benchmark is an 
important metric for the users of the consolidated 
financial statements. We determined materiality 
consistently with the previous financial year.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our 
opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of €0.3 million, which are 
identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in 
our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is 
included in the consolidated financial statements.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, 
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and 
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities 
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information 
or specific items.
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities, being Flow Traders B.V. and Flow 
Traders U.S. LLC, based on the relative financial size of these components.

We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors 
(including internal audit, legal, compliance, risk management, finance, human resources, 
head of operations and regional directors) and the supervisory board. 
The presumed fraud risks, enquiries and other available information did not lead to specific 
indications of fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the view of the 
financial statements.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations
We assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that 
could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our 
general industry experience, through discussions with the management board, reading minutes, 
inspection of internal audit and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of details 
of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures. Given that the company operates in 
a highly regulated environment, there is an increased risk of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations that may result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the company that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
We inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained 
alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. In case of potential 
non-compliance with laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial 
statements, we assessed whether the company has an adequate process in place to evaluate 
the impact of non-compliance for its activities and financial reporting and, where relevant, 
whether the company implemented remediation plans. Finally we obtained written represen­
tations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been 
disclosed to us.
Our audit response related to going concern
As disclosed under ‘2. Going concern’ in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and 
in the section ‘Going concern’ included in the management board report, management made 
a specific assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to continue 
its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated the specific 
assessment with management, exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional 
skepticism.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due 
to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the company and its environment 
and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process 
and management’s process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of 
internal control and how the supervisory board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes.
We refer to section ‘Enterprise risk management’ of the management board report for 
management’s (fraud) risk assessment.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in 
particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle blower procedures 
and incident registration. We evaluated the design and the implementation, and where 
considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls designed to 
mitigate fraud risks.
As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to 
financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close 
co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present. We also considered whether the 
Covid-19 pandemic gives rise to specific fraud risk factors with remote working, office closures 
or illness possibly diluting the effectiveness of internal controls. 
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of 
our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or 
non-compliance. 
As in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of controls and 
when identifying and assessing fraud risks we presumed that there are risks of fraud in revenue 
recognition. For the risks related to management override of controls we have performed 
procedures among others to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may 
represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important 
judgment areas and significant accounting estimates, in particular relating to fair value 
measurement as disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements. We have also used data 
analytics to identify and address high-risk journal entries. These risks did however not require 
significant auditor’s attention during our audit.

Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify serious doubts on the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signif­
icance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to 
the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters 
discussed. 
In comparison with previous year, our key audit matters did not change.
We considered whether management’s going concern assessment, based on our knowledge 
and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, 
contains all events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, also focusing on whether the company meets the regulatory 
solvency requirements for an investment firm. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Risk
Our audit approach
Key observations 
Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for trading 
As disclosed in note 7 of the financial statements, Flow 
Traders’ fair value measurement of financial assets and 
liabilities held for trading is based on internally determined 
theoretical prices, which are also used for quoting purposes. 
As such, valuation can differ from closing prices at various 
stock exchanges or prices from clearers, for example due to 
market illiquidity, variety in opening hours of the stock 
exchanges and the use of hedging instruments. 
The fair values recorded could include estimates which are 
subjective by nature. Therefore, we identified the valuation 
of financial assets and liabilities held for trading as a key 
audit matter. 
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing 
the appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies 
related to valuation of financial assets and liabilities 
according to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 13 “Fair 
Value Measurement”. In addition, we obtained an 
understanding of the valuation process, including verifi­
cations done by the Risk and Mid-Office department. 
We evaluated the design and implementation of internal 
controls relevant to fair value measurement, involving our 
own experts in the area of valuation of trading positions. 
We performed risk-based sample testing on the valuation of 
individual positions by evaluating the internally developed 
prices against market prices from independent sources. 
Furthermore, we evaluated the presentation and disclosure 
in the financial statements for compliance and consistency 
with IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure” and IFRS 13 
on disclosure requirements for financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading, including the fair value hierarchy.
Based on our procedures performed, we consider the fair 
value of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading to 
be reasonable and we consider the related disclosures to be 
adequate and appropriate in accordance with the 
requirements under EU-IFRS.

Our audit approach
Key observations 
Digital assets transactions and balances
Flow Traders trades in cryptographically secured digital 
assets (‘cryptocurrencies’) as disclosed in note 16 to the 
financial statements. The cryptocurrencies positions are 
recorded as other assets held for trading and results 
recorded as part of trading income. Cryptocurrencies are 
exchangeable directly between two parties through 
decentralized (‘blockchain’) networks that record 
anonymous transaction data. Alternatively, direct trades are 
executed between members of non-regulated crypto­
currency exchanges. Reference is made to the information 
on cryptocurrencies in  Note 31 Financial risk management. 
For entities that use third parties to store the private keys 
that provides access to the digital assets, ownership has to 
be established based on legal terms. This determines 
whether an entity should recognize the assets or a right to 
the assets.
We recognized a risk in the existence of the cryptocurrency 
positions. In addition, we recognized a risk of incorrect 
valuation of cryptocurrencies, given the high volatility and 
large number of different exchanges. We therefore 
considered the existence and valuation of cryptocurrency 
positions and transactions as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing 
the appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies 
related to classification and measurement of cryptocurrency 
positions under IFRS-EU. 
We performed procedures to evaluate the design and 
implementation of procedures related to cryptocurrencies 
by Flow Traders, including reviews performed by the Risk and 
Mid-Office and the compliance departments in onboarding 
exchanges as well as trading in new cryptocurrencies, 
involving our own experts in the area of digital assets. 
Furthermore, we evaluated the design and implementation 
of the daily trades reconciliation controls and procedures for 
deposits and withdrawals with cryptocurrency exchanges. 
Last, by observing the positions at each of the exchanges at 
year-end and subsequently testing on the valuation of 
individual positions by comparing the internally developed 
prices to independent sources, we independently tested the 
valuation and existence of the cryptocurrencies position of 
Flow Traders at 31 December 2021.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any 
material audit findings in relation to the existence or carrying 
values of the cryptocurrency assets.

European Single Electronic Reporting Format (ESEF)
Flow Traders N.V. has prepared the annual report in ESEF. The requirements for this are set out 
in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the 
specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).
In our opinion, the annual report, prepared in the XHTML format, including the partially 
marked-up consolidated financial statements, as included in the reporting package by Flow 
Traders, complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.
The management board is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial 
statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the management board combines 
the various components into a single reporting package.
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the annual report 
in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.
Our procedures, taking into account Alert 43 of the NBA (the Netherlands Institute of Chartered 
Accountants), included amongst others:
	
◾
obtaining an understanding of the company’s financial reporting process, including the 
preparation of the reporting package
	
◾
obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the 
reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension 
taxonomy files has been prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as 
included in the RTS on ESEF
	
◾
examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the 
reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and

Description of responsibilities for the financial statements
Responsibilities of the management board and the supervisory board for the financial 
statements
The management board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, the management board is responsible for such internal control as the 
Report on other information included in the annual report
The annual report contains other information in addition to the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. 
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:

Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements
	
◾
Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 for the management report and 
the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and as 
required by Sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub section 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the 
remuneration report.
Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial

the management report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other 
information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The management board and 
the supervisory board are responsible for ensuring that the remuneration report is drawn up

management board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the management board is responsible 
for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial 
reporting frameworks mentioned, the management board should prepare the financial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management board either 
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do 
so. The management board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant 
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means 
we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on 
our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism 
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements 
and independence requirements. The ‘Information in support of our opinion’ section above 
includes an informative summary of our responsibilities and the work performed as the basis 
for our opinion.
Our audit further included among others:
	
◾
Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
	
◾
Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
	
◾
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management board
	
◾
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures
	
◾
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Communication
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also submit an additional 
report to the audit committee of the supervisory board in accordance with Article 11 of the EU 
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. 
The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this 
auditor’s report.
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine the key audit 
matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the 
matter is in the public interest.
