Message of the Management Board
Overall, 2019 was marked by a reduction in market trading 
activity levels as well as relatively low levels of market 
volatility compared to 2018. 2019 was the first year that we 
traded in excess of €1 trillion of ETPs despite a decline in 
overall market volumes. We continued to reap the benefits 
of our strategy as our strong focus on scale and efficiency 
led to additional market share gains. We further grew our 
ETP market share in Europe, strengthening our leading 
position, and continued to make further inroads in the 
United States as well as in Asia. 
 
Market developments
Global Assets under Management invested in ETFs 
continued to develop in 2019, with a sharp increase in the 
popularity of Fixed Income ETFs. Investors are looking for 
opportunities to diversify their portfolios, and low cost, 
index-based ETFs are an attractive way to achieve this. 
Markets were impacted by a range of regional and global 
issues, with Brexit continuing to have a bearing on market 
sentiment in Europe. Globally, the US – China trade deal 
created ongoing uncertainty. However, the overall market 
was subdued for much of 2019.
Regulatory developments
From a regulatory perspective, we continued to comply with 
the capital requirements under CRR, monitored 
developments around Brexit, tracked the benefits of MiFID 
II in respect of market and product transparency, and made 
further improvements to our regulatory reporting systems. 
We followed closely the adoption of IFR and IFD and have 
now moved into the implementation phase ahead of the 
new regime coming into force in June 2021. Based on our 
Folkert Joling, Dennis Dijkstra and Thomas Wolff
“2019 was the first 
year that we traded in 
excess of €1 trillion of 
ETPs despite a decline 
in overall market 
volumes”

Looking ahead
Our focus in 2020 will remain on increasing efficiency and 
growing the business through diversification. In addition to 
moving into new asset classes, we will achieve this by 
expanding our technology infrastructure, which will enable 
us to increase our data processing abilities. We will also seek 
to look for opportunities to operate in an as cost conscious 
and efficient a way as possible. 
With offices in Hong Kong and Singapore, the business 
continuity plan remains in place with respect to recent 
political and public health developments in the region. 
Our main priority is to safeguard our people, which we can 
do by quickly moving staff to Singapore as and when 
necessary.
In 2020 we are delighted to welcome Britta Achmann to the 
company and the management board as Chief Risk Officer, 
subject to shareholders approval. 
2019 was also the year in which our co-CEO, Sjoerd Rietberg, 
left the company after many productive and successful 
years. We would like to thank him for his loyalty, hard work 
and dedication.
Finally, we want to thank the committed and dedicated Flow 
Traders’ team that drives our success, and acknowledge our 
shareholders and other stakeholders for their ongoing 
support and contribution. 
Regards,
Dennis Dijkstra, Folkert Joling and Thomas Wolff
initial analysis, we expect that it will have a neutral to slightly 
positive impact on our business. 
Executing on our strategy
Our focus during the year was on executing our strategy, 
ensuring that as we grow we remain as entrepreneurial as 
possible. Our senior management team, many of whom have 
grown with the company, play a vital role in sourcing 
experienced talent to develop new initiatives while nurturing 
graduate traineeships within our IT and trading 
environments. The Flow Academy forms an important part 
in the continuous training of our employees. Maintaining the 
company’s exceptional culture and core values is an 
important part of our mission, and as we scale up, we work 
hard to ensure the company’s openness and short 
communication lines are not lost. 
Diversification in asset classes
A key aspect of our growth strategy involves expanding into 
underlying asset classes such as Foreign Exchange and Fixed 
Income, which are expected to be major growth areas. 
To build strong and successful businesses in these arenas, 
we need to continue to invest capital in people. Hiring 
experienced professionals with knowledge of specific 
market structures and asset classes, such as Fixed Income 
and Foreign Exchange, and aligning the company around 
these areas, will help us create a stronger and more robust 
trading infrastructure. 
“A key aspect of our 
growth strategy 
involves expanding 
into underlying asset 
classes such as Foreign 
Exchange and Fixed 
Income”

success of the company. We believe that two people know 
more than one, and that people can have great ideas even in 
areas different to their core expertise. Which is why we 
welcome and encourage everyone to share their opinions. 
Anyone with a good idea, in their own area of expertise or 
another, is encouraged to share. This is part of the open, 
informal and diverse culture that makes us who we truly are. 
What we do
We are a technology company operating in the financial 
ecosystem, using our proprietary technology platform to 
quote bid and ask prices in thousands of financial products. 
We also provide liquidity in financial products, historically 
with a focus on exchange-traded products (ETPs). We do 
this globally, enabling investors to buy and sell ETPs 
efficiently by quoting bid and ask prices under virtually all 
market circumstances. In recent years we have commenced 
the diversification of our market making activities into other 
asset classes, such as Foreign Exchange (FX). 
Products
Exchange-traded products (ETPs)
ETPs, the main products that we trade, are often compared 
to mutual funds largely because they are both baskets of 
shares, bonds, or commodities. However, that is where the 
similarity ends. Unlike most mutual funds, the majority of 
ETPs simply track an index without trying to beat such 
indices. ETPs have open-ended fund structures rather than 
Who we are
We are a leading global financial technology-enabled 
liquidity provider in financial products, historically 
specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), 
now expanding into other asset classes. Founded in 2004, 
we continuously grow our organization, ensuring that our 
trading desks in Europe, the Americas and Asia can provide 
liquidity across all major exchanges, globally, 24 hours a day. 
We also continue to cultivate the entrepreneurial, innovative 
and team-oriented culture that has been with us since the 
beginning, which is built upon our four core values.
Our core values and culture
We have always believed that creating a strong and 
successful business requires a set of shared values that 
everyone can rally around. Values that help shape how 
everyone behaves, feels and develops at work every day. 
Which is why we have identified the core values that are the 
essence of Flow Traders:
	
◾
Open, informal and diverse
	
◾
Taking ownership 
	
◾
Entrepreneurial
	
◾
Team player
These values are a reflection of the things we believe in. 
And they shape our culture. We believe that how you 
perform is more important than what you wear. So our 
employees dress comfortably for work – jeans, t-shirts and 
sneakers are common. We believe that what someone says 
is more important than who says it. We believe that the 
contributions of our team-members are crucial to the

closed-end and, unlike mutual funds, can be continuously

off-exchange at all times. 
ETPs provide investors with exposure to a wide variety of 
underlying assets, ranging from ETPs that replicate the 
composition of a particular equity index, to those that 
provide investors with exposure to assets in specific sectors 
or countries, to commodities, or to currencies. ETPs also 
enable investors to create and manage diversified 
investment portfolios in an efficient manner, as well as 
enabling them to switch exposures at any given moment 
during trading days. There are broadly three main categories 
within ETPs in which we trade: 
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
This category is the most traded, when compared to ETCs 
and ETNs. ETFs derive their value from shares or bonds held 
in proportion to an index. For example, a Euro Stoxx 50 ETF 
would hold the same shares as the Euro Stoxx 50 index, 
in approximately the same proportions. Fixed-income ETFs 
derive their value from a portfolio of debt instruments. 
For example, bonds included in the Barclays US Treasury 1-3 
Year Term Index. ETFs are the most widespread among ETPs 
as measured by AuM.
Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)
ETCs typically derive their value from a commodity index, 
such as the Bloomberg Commodity Index, although in some 
cases they derive it from just a single commodity, such as 
gold or oil, or a certain currency. For example, the SPDR 
Gold Shares ETC tracks the value of physical gold. ETCs may 
hold physical assets, but exposure can also be held through 
derivatives of the underlying commodity, in combination 
with cash.

futures in the EMEA market to a fast-growing number of 
counterparties on an expanding number of platforms. 
In commodities, Flow Traders has always been active in the 
ETP market as well as the underlying asset classes. 
Moreover, we hold physical storage as collateral with our 
prime brokers if physical delivery is demanded by 
counterparties.
In Fixed Income, we have seen tremendous ETP market 
growth. Flow Traders has a strong position in this market, 
particularly in EMEA and in the US. During 2019, we sought to 
further optimize our trading proposition in Fixed Income 
ETPs by also trading the associated underlying instruments.
Flow Traders also trades cryptocurrency, which we consider 
to be a key part of our FICC proposition, while still a limited 
part of our overall business. We provide liquidity in certain 
crypto assets, given our position as an AP in the first listed 
crypto ETP in Switzerland. The capabilities of our trading 
infrastructure are such that we now also offer OTC flow to 
institutional investors in certain crypto assets.
Secondary market
The secondary market is where ETP trading takes place 
between market participants, similar to the trading of 
ordinary shares, at market-determined prices. Secondary 
market participants include institutional and retail investors, 
liquidity providers and APs. Secondary markets include 
exchanges and other automated trading venues, as well as 
off-exchange trading between market participants such as 
large institutional investors.
Fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC)
Leveraging the scale and capabilities of our ETP proprietary 
technology platform, Flow Traders has been able to also 
trade an increasing volume of the underlying asset classes in 
2019 mainly in FICC.
Flow Traders started providing liquidity in FX as a separate 
asset class during 2018 and we have invested further in the 
business in order to drive growth in 2019. We provide 
liquidity in an increasing number of FX pairs on spot and 
Exchange-traded notes (ETNs)
ETNs are types of unsecured, unsubordinated debt 
securities issued by an underwriting bank. The returns of 
ETNs are based on the performance of the index being 
tracked. For example, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term 
Futures Index TR ETN would track the S&P 500 VIX 
Short-Term Futures volatility index.
The ETP ecosystem
The ETP ecosystem is made up of a number of participants 
who together make ETP investing and trading possible. 
These include investors, ETP issuers, exchanges and other 
trading venues and authorized participants, who can also act 
as liquidity providers, such as Flow Traders. The ETP 
ecosystem can be further divided into two markets: the 
primary market and the secondary market.
Primary market
Interaction in the primary market takes place between 
authorized participants (APs) and the issuers, who either 
issue or cancel ETPs. This is done in reaction to market 
demand and is called the creation and redemption process. 
APs can create ETPs with the issuer by transferring the 
underlying assets (or cash equivalent) to the issuer in return 
for a corresponding number of newly issued ETPs. 
This increases the ETPs’ Assets under Management (AuM). 
In this way, the issuance of ETPs through APs provides the 
issuers with access to a broad investor market without 
having to support a complex and costly trading 
infrastructure which would be non-core to their business. 
Redemption is the reverse of the creation process: the AP 
transfers ETPs to their issuer in exchange for the underlying 
assets (or a cash equivalent). The issuer then cancels the 
ETPs it received. This decreases the ETPs’ AuM.

One of our software platform’s core features is its modular 
design, which allows us to rapidly test and implement 
ongoing enhancements. This also means we can easily and 
cost-effectively expand our coverage of securities, asset 
classes, and geographical markets as we grow the business.
In 2019 our total technology expenses increased by 
12 percent versus 2018 as we invested further in the trading 
business. In 2019 our technology expenses represented 
40 percent of our total fixed expenses. In 2019, the number 
of technology FTEs grew to 204 from 162, also confirming 
our overall growth.
Pricing
Pricing ETPs accurately 
Being able to accurately price the ETPs that we provide 
liquidity in is vital to the success of our business. Get it 
wrong, and we risk not winning the trade or losing money 
due to bad prices. Our experience in establishing the pricing 
relationship between the ETPs and the underlying assets in 
a variety of market conditions means we can offer 
competitive bid and ask prices, while still covering our 
trading costs and locking in transaction profit. We achieve 
this using pre-set hedging strategies, which, when possible, 
instantly reduce our market exposure, creating a market-
neutral position. Hedging strategies like these enable us to 
trade ETPs in such a way that our Net Trading Income is 
virtually unaffected by any price movements of the 
underlying or related securities. 
Cutting edge proprietary technology 
platform
Developing software in-house 
As noted, we are a technology company operating in the 
financial industry. As such, technology lies at the heart of 
our business, enabling us to provide liquidity in a variety of 
market environments across the globe. We trade using 
proprietary and scalable software with the vast majority of 
our applications developed in-house. These include pricing 
and trading software, market data processing tools, 
pre-trade risk controls, and other risk and compliance tools. 
This is the main reason that our technology department 
makes up over 40 percent of our total staff and is our 
largest employee group.
Flow Traders expects that this diversification will lead to 
a larger contribution of underlying asset classes to the total 
value traded. It will also improve our ETP trading capabilities 
and improve our ability to grow NTI structurally. Ultimately, 
Flow Traders’ goal is to become a one-stop shop liquidity 
platform in financial markets globally.
Liquidity Provider
Leading liquidity provider
Flow Traders has two main roles in the financial ecosystem. 
The first is as a liquidity provider. In this role, we help 
maintain and improve the overall transparency and 
efficiency of the ecosystem, by quoting bid and ask prices 
for financial products like ETPs, FX and other products on 
trading venues, as well as off-exchange to institutional 
investors, which market participants can trade against. 
By providing liquidity we make it easier for investors to buy 
and sell financial products at a price that should reflect the 
(relation with the) current price of the underlying asset, 
and contribute to lower trading costs.
 
Another role we play in the ETP landscape is as an 
Authorized Participant (AP). We have AP-agreements in 
place with all the major ETP issuers. These agreements link 
the primary and the secondary ETP market and allow us to 
either create or redeem the ETPs and optimize our role as 
a leading liquidity provider in ETPs.

may deem relevant. Our intentions in relation to dividends 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control.
The Management Board, subject to the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, may decide to make allocations to 
reserves and therefore decides how much of the profit will 
be allocated to reserves. The profits remaining shall be at 
the disposal of the General Meeting. 
Reserves and dividend proposal for the financial year 
2019
Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the company’s Articles of 
Association, the Management Board, with the approval of 
the Supervisory Board, has decided that of the profit for 
2019 (totaling €53.1 million), an amount of €11.2 million shall 
be added to the reserves. The remaining amount of € 41.9 
million is at the disposal of the General Meeting.
It is proposed to the General Meeting that a total cash 
dividend of €0.90 per share will be paid out to shareholders 
for the financial year 2019, subject to a 15 percent dividend 
withholding tax (dividendbelasting). An interim cash 
dividend of €0.35 per share was paid out on 15 August 2019. 
This means that the final cash dividend proposal to the 
General Meeting is €0.55 per share. Subject to approval by 
the General Meeting on 24 April 2020, shares will trade 
ex-dividend on 28 April 2020. Payment of the final dividend 
is anticipated to be made on 5 May 2020. Please also refer to

Dividend policy
Flow Traders intends to pay dividends annually in two 
instalments, with a target aggregate dividend pay-out ratio 
of at least 50 percent of the company’s net profits realized 
during the financial year. The Management Board may

profits realized during a financial year will fully or partially 
be appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. 
A distribution of (interim) dividends is subject to applicable 
rules and regulations, the Articles of Association of the 
company, the By-Laws of the Management Board, and the 
By-Laws of the Supervisory Board.
It is anticipated that our interim dividends will be declared 
and paid following the publication of our results for the first 
half of each year. However, there can be no assurance that in 
any given year a dividend will be proposed or declared.
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and 
timing thereof will depend on a number of factors, including 
legal and regulatory requirements, future profits, financial 
conditions, general economic and business conditions, 
future prospects and such other factors as the Management 
Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board,

Our strategy 
We will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing to grow 
our business and diversify into other asset classes. 
This should result in increasing our Net Trading Income (NTI), 
while maintaining our desired risk profile, controlling costs, 
and securing and attracting the right talent. Increasing our 
NTI involves increasing the product of volume and the net 
margin we capture per trade, where volume is the value of 
products we trade and the net margin is the margin we 
capture per trade after the corresponding exposure has 
been hedged. Our risk profile is characterized by having no 
directional opinion on the market. In other words, our results 
do not depend on the direction of market prices. 
By expanding our presence as a liquidity provider in both the 
ETPs and underlying asset classes, Flow Traders can 
maximize the growth of its NTI. 
By growing our presence in the global financial market as 
a liquidity provider, we build a foundation to support our 
long-term growth trend. By growing our presence in 
underlying asset classes, we expect to improve our 
performance in the future, including during those periods 
where the trading activity in the market may slow down. 
Our ambition and strategy 
Our strategic ambition
Our ambition is to become a one-stop shop liquidity 
platform in financial markets globally.
Our market
We operate in a highly competitive market that is changing 
rapidly. It is characterized by heightened regulation and an 
ever-increasing focus on technology. Yet the market’s core 
function remains the same: transferring risk between 
market participants. This is where we add value. Our focus 
will continue to be on providing liquidity in more and more 
products in the financial markets with still a focus on ETPs. 
Our business principles
Our business principles are being flexible, agile and focused 
on continuous improvements. To be successful, 
we recognize that we need to perform well across all areas 
of the business. Achieving this involves diligently studying 
the markets and our responses to them, and using our 
resources where they have the greatest impact. 
The outcome of this process defines whether or not we have 
a competitive edge.
We create value in a number of financial and 
non-financial ways for a variety of stakeholders. 
Supported by our proprietary technology 
platform, we provide liquidity in financial 
products that helps contribute to more efficient 
markets by lowering overall trading costs, 
delivering greater execution quality and market 
transparency. For our employees, we provide a 
compelling and constantly evolving work 
environment that enables them to develop to 
their full potential. We take an active interest in 
the societies in which we operate, contributing to 
local learning initiatives and charities. And we 
care for our investors by focusing on growing 
profitably and providing dividend returns. 
Our value creation model shows how we create 
value and the impact our business has on our 
stakeholders.

differences that are realized between buying and selling 
related or correlating assets. Whether that is between the 
ETPs we buy or sell, and the prices we pay or receive for the 
underlying or related financial instruments to mitigate our 
risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager and do 
not have our own Assets under Management (AuM). We also 
do not develop or make products, do not provide any 
services and do not have (consumer) clients. Our value chain 
comprises, among others, of our institutional 
counterparties, prime brokers and regulators. 
The ETP market
The popularity of ETPs has continued to grow in recent 
years. According to asset manager BlackRock Advisors, 
global ETP AuM grew from €4,192 billion in 2018 to €5,616 
billion by the end of 2019. This growth is expected to 
continue, as investors continue to invest in low-cost, 
transparent and easy-to-trade passive investment 
strategies. This contributes to the long-term value creation 
of Flow Traders’ strategy.
We believe there are a number of reasons for this trend to 
continue, including beyond 2020: one is that investors are 
attracted to the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables 
them to follow clearly how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid and 
available at low-cost and can be bought and sold easily 
during market hours. A third reason is that ETPs can be 
composed of financial instruments from almost any asset 
class, sector or location, providing investors access to 
markets that would normally be difficult to reach.
In addition to ETPs we provide liquidity in similar instruments 
whose value is correspondingly affected by a change in the 
value of underlying or related assets, such as futures or 
bonds. 
During 2019, we continued to implement our diversification 
initiatives into other asset classes and provided liquidity as 
a market maker including in FX, Fixed Income and 
cryptocurrency.
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider we 
generally do not have a directional opinion on the market. 
In other words, our results do not depend on the direction of 
market prices. Our NTI is realized through the small price 
Markets and trends
Our business
In 2019 we had access to more than 180 trading venues in 40 
countries around the world. We provide liquidity in over 
7,000 ETP listings on- and off-exchange, which is 55 percent 
of all ETPs globally.
Off-exchange, we provide liquidity in ETPs on a request-
for-quote basis to more than 1,300 institutional 
counterparties across the globe, including banks, asset 
managers, pension funds, insurance companies, family 
offices, hedge funds, and others and this number is 
increasing on an almost daily basis.

APAC in terms of trading volumes, confirming the 
contribution of investments made in previous years in the 
region. 
ETP market remains high growth market
We still see significant opportunities for growth in the ETP 
market, driven by the widely expected expansion of this 
industry in the near future. This is due to a number of 
changes within the asset management industry, including: 
ETP products, as those 10 determine roughly 55 percent to 
65 percent of the total market volumes. The total ETP value 
traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) was €2.0 trillion in 
2019, including China, while the total ETP value traded at our 
APAC offices was €42 billion. We completed the 
consolidation of the dealing rooms in APAC and trading has 
been optimized by moving all trading desks for on-screen 
liquidity provision to Hong Kong. This will also help facilitate 
future growth. Flow Traders had a successful year in 2019 in 
Review of 2019 
Global ETP markets grew by 34 percent in 2019 measured in 
AuM, driven again by the popularity of equity and fixed 
income ETPs. Annual global inflows of ETP AuM were €499 
billion in 2019 (2018: €450 billion – source BlackRock Global 
ETP Landscape December 2019), resulting in the second best 
year after 2017. Overall trading activity in 2019 reduced given 
lower volatility levels and a trend towards ETPs becoming 
a more ‘buy and hold’ investment as they become a more 
established part of the asset management product universe. 
Global coverage
Following Flow Traders’ recent expansion, we trade globally 
from five offices: in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, London, 
New York and Singapore. 2019 was the first year that Flow 
Traders ETP value traded surpassed the €1 trillion mark. 
The largest ETP market is still in the United States, where 
total ETP value traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) was 
€20.1 trillion in 2019. Our New York office’s total ETP value 
traded was €452.4 billion in 2019, an improvement versus 
2018 and, for the second year in a row, a record year for Flow 
Traders US since inception. With institutional trading gaining 
further momentum in 2019, Flow Traders US continued to 
grow its overall presence. 
The EMEA ETP market had a total ETP value traded of €1.5 
trillion in 2019. Our total ETP value traded from our Europe 
offices was €514.9 billion in 2019. We remained the number 
one liquidity provider in ETPs in EMEA and managed to grow 
our on- and off-exchange presence further. 
In APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with large 
differences in trading volumes, trading costs, regulation and 
maturity across the financial markets. Volumes traded in the 
APAC region remained dominated by the top-10 most traded

counterparty base, as investors increased their focus on best 
execution, regardless of research access. With the expansion 
of our offices into London and the launch of liquidity 
provision in other asset classes, we have the building blocks 
in place to further increase our presence in Europe in 2020.
In the Americas, our ETP value traded continued to grow 
substantially in 2019, but remains relatively limited 
compared to the overall market size. We believe there is 
significant growth potential in Fixed Income ETFs, 
developed market equity ETFs and institutional trading. 
Institutional trading continued to gain mass in 2019 and is 
expected to grow further in 2020. We will continue to 
expand the number of products traded, the number of 
venues we trade on and the number of counterparties we 
are connected to in the US.

In general, we believe we can accelerate growth in all 
regions in the coming years, as electronic trading continues 
to evolve and we increasingly leverage on our technology

2019 was relatively subdued from a market 
trading activity standpoint and volatility 
remained relatively low through much of the 
year. In 2019, our NTI of €216 million (2018: €383 
million) reflected these market circumstances. 
Our performance
Financial overview 
Net Trading Income
2019 was relatively subdued from a market trading activity 
standpoint and volatility remained relatively low through 
much of the year with the VIX index never surpassing the 25 
point mark. Trade talks between the USA and China as well 
as Brexit developments were the key macro-economic 
topics yet did not yield significant trading activity. On the 
other hand, both equity and bond markets received 
considerable support from central bank actions in 2019, 
particularly following the rate cuts by the Fed and the ECB. 
In 2019, our NTI was €216 million (2018: €383 million) as 
markets normalized and became more subdued following 
the exceptional circumstances seen in February 2018. 
Flow Traders’ total value traded in 2019 grew to €4.0 trillion 
(2018: €3.6 trillion), of which €1.0 trillion (2018: €899 billion) 
was traded in ETPs. The rest was traded in related financial 
products to facilitate competitive pricing in ETPs. 
In contrast, market ETP value traded fell by 7 percent to 
€23.6 trillion, (2018: €25.4 trillion) as overall market activity 
levels reflected the low volatility environment seen for 
much of 2019. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Flow Traders reported NTI of 
€46.1 million which reflects an overall subdued market 
environment with reduced volumes and lower levels of 
volatility as well as weaker than expected trading in the US. 
ETP value traded declined five percent quarter-on-quarter, 
as velocity declined.
Market volatility
In 2019 market volatility declined from the levels witnessed 
in 2018. The main volatility took place in January and August 
with average VIX levels of 20 and 19 respectively for those 
months. Otherwise market volatility slowed down 
particularly towards the end of the year. Outside of these 
months, the VIX fell back to levels around the low-to-mid 
teens.
Operational expenses
Our fixed operational expenses developed well within the 
guided fixed cost growth rate of maximum 15 percent 
annually. While we continued to invest in our people and 
technology to ensure future growth, with our FTEs growing 
18 percent to 513 at year-end 2019, we also improved 
efficiency and maintained a tight control on execution and 
process management. The additional FTEs were the main 
contributor to the 10 percent growth in fixed operational 
expenses. Lower NTI and the growth in fixed operational 
expenses contributed to an EBITDA margin in 2019 of 36 
percent (2018: 52 percent).
Capital base
During the year we continued to maintain a strong, stable 
capital base, comfortably exceeding both our regulatory 
and prime broker capital requirements. We paid out a €0.35 
interim dividend in August 2019 and propose to pay €0.55 as 
a final dividend over 2019. Over the course of 2019 we 
therefore aim to return a total of €0.90 through dividends to 
our shareholders, which represents a 78 percent dividend 
pay-out ratio.

For us Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is about creating 
shared value. To better help manage our impact and our 
need to create shared value, we have divided our CSR focus 
across four main areas: Economy, People, Environment and 
Society. We have also connected these four CSR focus areas 
with three corresponding United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) that we believe are particularly 
relevant for Flow Traders. 
Below we outline our priorities within each of these CSR 
focus areas, and explain our extended efforts to positively 
impact the world around us. At the end of this chapter we 
provide more information on our SDGs. 
As at 31 December 2019, our regulatory capital requirements 
under CRR were €154 million. As Flow Traders’ capital was 
€287 million, this resulted in an excess capital position of 
€133 million.
Growth
We continued to grow our team, strategies and 
infrastructure in 2019. We increased our institutional 
counterparties globally to over 1,300 and increased the 
number of venues connected to 187. To facilitate this 
growth, we continued to grow the business during the year 
across all regions, resulting in an increase in the number of 
FTEs to 513 by year-end (2018: 436).
Shared value
Flow Traders was founded more than 15 years ago, and in 
that time we have developed an innovative and 
entrepreneurial spirit that enables us to grow and explore 
new markets. We recognize that with this growth come 
responsibilities that go beyond our core business, and that 
our activities influence the society in which we live and 
operate. 
At the same time, society has a very real impact on our 
business and operations. Both the Management Board and 
the Supervisory Board pay close attention to a wide variety 
of developments and trends that could pose either a risk or 
an opportunity. One example is the geopolitical risk that 
could accompany a no-deal Brexit. Another is the 
opportunity that comes with the shift to digitalization, which 
is helping make financial products and services more widely 
available to investors across society.

Social Responsibility 
is about creating 
shared value”

Providing liquidity to financial markets
As a liquidity provider we are active on global financial 
markets and we contribute to transparency in the pricing 
process, enabling market participants to invest at fair prices 
and lower costs. We enable thousands of exchange-traded 
products (ETPs) and other financial products to be traded 
across the world’s markets, by continuously quoting bid and 
ask prices. As an innovative segment of global financial 
markets, ETPs have introduced efficiencies and cut 
investment costs substantially for a wide range of investors, 
from pension funds to retail investors. Increased liquidity, 
higher execution quality, and lower overall trading costs are 
just some of the benefits that liquidity providers, such as 
Flow Traders, offer through these innovative financial 
products compared to more traditional investment 
products. In 2019 we saw an increase in the amount of 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ETFs and ETPs, 
including ESG products focused on clean/alternative energy 
investments. As a leading liquidity provider in ETPs globally, 
Flow Traders naturally trades ESG-related products with its 
counterparties.
Our role is to enable trading in widely diversified investment 
products to anyone at any time, allowing end-investors to 
invest with lower costs and thus produce potentially higher 
returns. As a result, over the years trading costs have 
dropped dramatically and access to transparent and 
inexpensive investment products for anyone has never been 
more open or efficient. This benefits institutional investors, 
individual investors and, ultimately, society at large by 
creating a more open and accessible financial market.

complexity of the continuously changing tax legislation, 
and the fact that this may create uncertainty for Flow 
Traders, we obtain independent external tax advice through 
reputable tax firms or, when appropriate, approval is 
obtained from tax authorities on specific material or 
complex tax matters.
The key participants in the Tax Control Framework are well 
established and include the Supervisory Board, 
Management Board, Finance department, Tax department, 
internal auditors and external auditors. They are able to 
assess and weigh the risks associated with the tax decision 
process for our business and stakeholders. Under Flow 
Traders Tax Control Framework, significant tax positions, 
including the tax strategy, are always shared with and 
subject to the approval of the Management Board. 
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local tax legislation. We do not use tax 
haven jurisdictions for tax avoidance purposes and carry out 
our business through entities in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the company can operate its business in 
line with its belief that it is part of the corporate social 
responsibility duty to pay taxes where it operates. In addition 
to corporate income taxes, Flow Traders pays many other 
taxes, including but not limited to, payroll taxes and social 
security contributions on the wages of its employees, value 
added taxes and property taxes. All these taxes are 
a significant basis of funding governmental public services. 
It is our social responsibility to contribute through taxes in 
the regions we operate in. Each year, our auditor’s tax team 
provides assurance on Flow Traders material tax positions. 
For more information on our tax position, please refer to 
note 12 of the financial statements.
The dialogue we have with stakeholders includes discussions 
on our financial reporting and tax policy and, as with all 
stakeholder input, is considered during our decision-making 
process. However, so far we have not seen a desire among 
stakeholders for a change to our tax policy. We support 
transparency initiatives, such as country-by-country 
reporting and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting from the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), and frequently assess the impact of such initiatives. 
We also closely monitor the reporting thresholds under the 
country-by-country reporting rules, to ensure that we meet 
our reporting obligations when we fall under the scope of 
this rule. Where necessary or relevant, we take the 
appropriate actions to adopt these initiatives in our tax 
control framework. Further details on our tax policy can be 
found under Tax Principles on our website. The tax principles 
also serve as KPIs throughout our performance 
measurement. The tax function within the company will 
therefore provide appropriate input as part of the approval 
process for business proposals to ensure a clear 
understanding of the tax consequences. 
We have good standing relationships with the tax authorities 
in each region in which we operate. We proactively manage 
our relationship with the tax authorities with the aim of 
minimizing the risk of challenge, dispute or damage that 
could have an impact on our credibility. We concluded 
a horizontal supervision agreement with the Dutch Tax 
Authority (horizontaal toezicht) with a view to further 
strengthening our transparent and professional relationship 
with the tax authorities. Tax laws, rules and interpretations 
are continuously subject to a changing social view towards 
tax and we cannot be certain of continued benefit from 
certain tax regimes, such as the FSI Schemes in Singapore 
and innovation box regime in the Netherlands. Given the 
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager and do 
not have our own Assets under Management (AuM). We also 
do not develop or make products, do not provide any 
services and do not have (consumer) clients. Our value chain

counterparties, prime brokers and regulators.
Commitment to responsible tax strategy
We are committed to being good corporate citizens, bringing 
positive value to the communities we operate in. We pay 
taxes where they are due and subscribe to fair taxation in 
terms of corporate income tax. We note that taxes are not 
limited to corporate income tax but also include VAT, wages 
tax, social securities, dividend withholding tax, stamp duties 
and other transaction taxes. In 2019 we incurred total 
corporate income taxes of €12 million which was 19% 
percent of our taxable income. We believe it is vital to 
operate a fair, transparent and straightforward tax policy, 
which is required when running a sustainable business and 
delivering long-term value to all our stakeholders. 
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of its 
financial reporting and its relations with tax authorities 
globally. With regard to financial reporting, conservative 
accounting principles are being applied and one-offs must 
occur infrequently and be clearly documented. In the 
current rapid changing tax landscape and the associated 
various (new) tax reporting requirements, Flow Traders as 
a technology enabled liquidity provider strives to automate 
tax filing processes as much as possible. Flow Traders is 
a strong believer that by automating tax processes it 
improves the compliance quality and the insight of the 
company’s tax position.

why a numerical test is an important part of the selection 
procedure. To experience the world of trading first hand, 
we invite a select group of students to our Business Courses 
in our Amsterdam and New York offices. The two-day event 
is packed with interesting and challenging trading exercises 
and simulations and includes quantitative and technical 
cases to mirror the evolving nature of the role. In a similar 
fashion, we host the Flow Traders Arbitrage Challenge case 
competition in Singapore and Hong Kong. We also host 
numerous informal events such as the annual poker 
tournaments in Amsterdam, Australia and New York, chess 
tournaments in Amsterdam, and trading competitions in 
select universities in Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong 
and Singapore.
As a technology enabled firm, we facilitate opportunities for 
young talent in technology. In 2019 we continued to invest in 
the Graduate Software Development program, which will 
enhance the experience of new graduates joining the 
company in 2020. The program was designed for ambitious, 
skilled and creative graduates who like to be challenged 
every day and who strive to make visible contributions to the 
further growth of our business. Successful applicants join 
the company’s development teams for one year to work on 
a variety of projects. One of the goals is to improve the 
proprietary technology platform that enables Flow Traders 
to trade on exchanges worldwide. The projects cover 
multiple areas of our technology landscape. After 
completing their project, participants present their results, 
led by the Global Head of Technology. Throughout the 
program, graduates receive continuous support from 
dedicated mentors, not only in the field of technology, 
but also in the area of personal development.

Creating sustainable employment
Since the day we were founded, our goal has been to foster 
a culture that encourages innovation, entrepreneurialism 
and risk-awareness, while focusing on drive, teamwork and 
ownership. By developing talent in-house and maintaining 
a committed and substantial employee shareholder base, 
we have strengthened internal bonds and helped create 
a loyal, forward-looking team. We are proud that we create 
and maintain high-quality jobs, which result in a stable and 
trusting working environment that benefits our people, 
our business, and society.
Attracting talent
Our offices are all growing, and we look to hire as many 
qualified applicants as we can find. However, our selection 
standards remain high – our candidates need to go through 
a number of tests and interviews, with less than 1 percent of 
applicants for trading positions ultimately receiving a job 
offer. To find people with the unique skill sets needed for 
a global liquidity provider we recruit across the globe, 
advertising and searching across multiple platforms. 
We also visit campuses in India, Hong Kong, Australia, 
Singapore, the US, and across Europe, meeting talents in 
career fairs and workshops. We recruit for all disciplines and 
look for the best caliber available, regardless of their gender, 
age, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. To take an 
unbiased decision, in our recruitment process for certain 
events, certain data, including names and gender, is blacked 
out.
Graduate traders are typically recruited straight from 
university. Although our traders have a varied educational 
background, they share a strong numerical aptitude, which is

Graduate Software Developers are typically recruited 
straight from university, having Computer Science or 
Engineering-related educational backgrounds. All graduates 
share a strong interest in either C++ or Java, which is why 
a coding test is an important part of the selection procedure. 
To experience development at Flow Traders first hand, 
we invite an exclusive group of students to our technology 
event CODE@FLOW in our Amsterdam office. The two-day 
challenge gives participants an opportunity to engage in 
high-tech discussions and technical cases with our 
specialists in software development and trading, followed 
by a competitive hackathon.
In 2019 we continued hosting, participating in, 
and sponsoring a variety of events, ranging from in-house 
days, a special event for woman who are curious about 
a career in the trading industry and various meet ups. 
With the opening of our new London branch last year, 
we have structurally increased our presence in the relevant 
universities in the UK and held multiple recruitment 
campaigns. 
Healthy working environment
All our offices are designed to provide a pleasant and 
ergonomically sound place to work. They are flooded with 
light, have attractive, well laid out interiors and 
ergonomically-optimized furniture. In addition, to give our 
people the opportunity to perform at their best, we offer 
healthy breakfast and lunch options, have our own bar in 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong, New York and Singapore, 
and organize great company trips and parties. 
In Amsterdam, we also have our own in-house gym facilities 
and an in-house barber in New York. We not only use our 
newly-designed bars for after work gatherings, but also for 
recruiting events and quarterly staff updates. We believe 
these benefits are important to maintain a healthy and 
happy workforce and to stimulate bonding and connections 
beyond employees’ direct circle of colleagues, helping to 
encourage teamwork across the whole company.
Onboarding
We are a fast growing company, which creates good jobs 
across a variety of departments. In 2019 we welcomed over 
139 new hires, resulting in a 18 percent increase in the 
number of employees year-on-year. Our new colleagues join 
us from all parts of the world. To make sure they feel at 
home quickly we offer full relocation support for everyone 
moving to our offices from abroad. We help with finding 
a home, applying for a visa and getting to know the local 
culture. We also offer our international employees based in 
Amsterdam the opportunity to attend Dutch language 
classes.

Diversity, inclusion and collaboration
We believe that a diverse workforce, which has open 
communication channels and the freedom to collaborate 
and introduce best practices, helps create a richer variety of 
ideas and can better develop solutions to the challenges we 
face. 
We have a long-standing policy of recruiting and retaining 
the best talent available and aim to provide an inclusive 
working environment regardless of the gender, ethnicity, 
faith or sexual orientation of our employees. We are 
committed to providing equal employment opportunities to 
all qualified job applicants. As a result, we employ people 
from 52 nationalities across our offices. The composition of 
our workforce tracks the outflow of the education system in 
the various roles we offer. We strongly encourage women to 
apply for any function within the firm, particularly when they 
have a background in fields that traditionally have a higher 
proportion of male employees. This is supported by our 
Equal Opportunity Policy (please refer to the chapter Our 
governance for further information). 
We also believe in open communication and encourage 
collaboration across the company. Everyone within the 
company has unrestricted, direct access to senior 
management and are regularly informed and consulted 
about key developments. People are encouraged to speak 
their minds to help make Flow Traders a better place to 
work. Information travels freely and is not restricted unless 
we need to protect overriding interests, such as those 
concerning regulations, commercial sensitivities or to 
protect our intellectual property.
Training and rotation
We invest in our people. For example, we provide them with 
a range of excellent training programs, benefitting them and 
the company. 
Our new hires in trading and technology start with an intensive 
introduction program, bringing them up to speed with our 
way of working and training them in the specific skills they 
need to do their job well. All junior traders – including those 
hired for our Asian and the US offices – begin their global 
training program at our offices in Amsterdam. 
And all new employees receive an introduction to Flow 
Traders through the Flow Academy, including online and 
on-site training that provides programs in a wide variety of 
subjects, including culture, technology, regulatory 
developments, trading for non-traders, and the 
Whistleblower Policy, including anti-corruption. Through 
Flow Academy we offer everyone varied training 
opportunities, aimed at improving function-specific skills or 
for their own personal development. In 2019, we further 
expanded the available offerings, with both online and live 
training session formats. 
Many of our managers are ‘home-grown’, having developed 
into their positions after a number of years working with the 
company. They set an example and act as an inspiration for 
new hires, illustrating the career paths open to them. And to 
complement self-growth, we also like to give our employees 
the chance to transfer between our offices and experience 
life and work elsewhere.

2019, out of 513 employees, 328 employees are active 
participants of various employee share plans.
In 2015 a group of employees bought shares in Flow Traders. 
These shares are subject to a six-year lock-up period. 
25 percent of these shares have been released on 1 June 
2018 and up to 50 percent of these shares became available 
for sale on 1 June 2019. The remaining parts of the shares will 
be released as set out below:
	
◾
up to 75 percent of these shares will become available 
on 1 June 2020;
	
◾
all of these shares will become available on 1 June 2021.
In the event of termination of employment during the 
lock-up period the relevant people must offer their 
unreleased shares to the company for the lower of (i) the 
corresponding subscription price paid of €14.44 or (ii) the fair 
market value of the shares at the time of such termination, 
and in any event within five business days of Flow Traders 
having given notice to the relevant participant thereof. 
The company may at its discretion accept the offer, subject 
to any applicable restrictions under corporate or securities 
laws. See also note 25 in the Financial Statements.

We are a sponsor of Women in ETFs and have co-organized

Women in ETFs. 
Remuneration
We believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and office are 
entitled to receive variable compensation relative to their 
contribution to the firm as a whole. We are transparent 
about how we pay our people and how much we pay them, 
including management. We have a straightforward 
Remuneration Policy that permits variable pay only when 
a profit is made. We are constantly looking for ways to 
improve our remuneration principles. And because variable 
remuneration is, to a large extent, deferred, it remains at risk 
of forfeiture if we sustain a loss. We believe this is the 
strongest incentive for sustainable, risk-aware behavior for 
all our staff. In addition, we promote employee shareholding 
through the Flow Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP), an employee 
share purchase plan, and the Flow Loyalty Incentive Plan, 
a loyalty plan (FLIP), particularly at more senior levels. 
This aligns the interests of the company with those of our 
employees by creating ‘skin in the game’. 
Shares held by employees and 
Management Board members
We encourage our management and employees to invest in 
Flow Traders, linking the company’s long-term success to 
their personal financial circumstances. Around the time of 
the IPO, our CEO and a significant number of current and 
former employees have invested in Flow Traders in the past 
at fair value, using their own net worth. On 31 December

IMC Basis
Since 2018, we have been working together with IMC Basis, 
a non-profit initiative that helps children from 
disadvantaged backgrounds to broaden their perspectives 
on educational and professional possibilities. In 2018, 
we adopted a primary school located close to our 
Amsterdam office: OBS de Waaier. 
The goal of IMC Basis is to prepare primary school children in 
groups 7 and 8 to make independent, motivated and 
responsible decisions when it comes to their education or 
profession. The target group is children who grow up in 
low-income areas. 
Working with IMC Basis, we have created a program for the 
children that compliments their regular educational 
program. In 2019, the program included lessons on 
technology, animals and nature, and law and politics. 
to use more environmentally friendly solutions for lighting 
and water consumption. We also offer a full lunch to all our 
employees, healthy and free of charge. We work to limit our 
food waste as much as possible by responsible purchasing of 
ingredients and making sure leftovers are consumed the 
next day.
Many of our employees live reasonably close to our offices 
and where possible use is made of video-conferencing, 
limiting travel. No employee is offered a lease-car. Given the 
nature of our business our CO2 emission is not seen by us as 
material. Nonetheless we seek to limit our energy use and 
CO2 emissions to take care of our environment.
4	 Society
Societal commitments and charities
It is important for us to back initiatives that contribute to 
society. We support a number of charities, not only 
financially but also by offering access to our knowledge and 
experience. Our people are enthusiastic about supporting 
charitable initiatives, which has always been part of our 
working culture. We engage in community giving throughout 
the year, and across our offices. We do this by supporting 
Flow Traders employees in fundraising activities by giving 
time or access to our network, by providing guidance to help 
them have as large an impact as possible, and by 
contributing financially. 
In addition to individual employee initiatives, in 2019 we 
chose to focus our investment in the areas of children’s 
education and sports. We believe children should have the 
ability to learn, get a quality education and to be able to play 
sports. The initiatives we support include:

Reducing material use and waste
Our activities do not involve the production, use, processing 
or transport of physical goods. However, that does not 
prevent us from looking for ways to operate our business 
sustainably, for example by reducing our material use and 
waste. In 2019, we stopped using single-use water bottles 
and provided employees with reusable water bottles. 
This limited the plastic waste within the company 
significantly. And when refurbishing our offices, we sought

Flow Traders was responsible for creating lessons about 
topics such as entrepreneurship. In January, eight Flow 
Traders employees gave entrepreneurship lessons at the 
primary school. The children worked in teams to create 
a product they would be able to sell to Flow Traders 
employees during a market day at our office. The money 
raised from the market was given to a charity chosen by the 
children from the primary school. In June, we organized 
a workshop at Flow Traders. Over the course of a full day, 
children learned more about healthy meals and the catering 
industry.
Sporttop 
Competitiveness and drive are part of our success, and the 
success of elite athletes. That is why we teamed-up with 
Sporttop, a foundation that links young, talented athletes to 
experienced Olympians and champions. These more 
experienced athletes mentor the talented youngsters, using 
their own experience, focusing on the mental mindset rather 
than the technical aspects of the sport. Together with 
Sporttop, during the year we hosted a series of inspirational 
talks for our employees. 
Other organizations we sponsored in 2019:
	
◾
Women in ETFs
	
◾
Stichting Diabetes Onderzoek Nederland
	
◾
Stichting Students to Space
	
◾
Stichting Heart to Handle
	
◾
Make -A-Wish (Christmas Fulfil-A-Wish)
	
◾
And a number of other charities
Individual employees also initiated charity support during 
the year, enlisting the help of their colleagues and the 
company:
	
◾
Flow Traders, together with its employees, supports the 
annual Sinterklaas toy drive in which employees donate 
toys that their children no longer play with, new toys 
they purchase for the cause, or make a financial 
donation that the foundation uses to buy new toys. 
These toys are then distributed to children who live in, 
or close to, poverty. 
	
◾
Flow Traders employees volunteered their time to 
Willing Hearts, a secular, non-affiliated charity 
providing and distributing around 5,000 daily meals in 
Singapore. Beneficiaries include the elderly, 
the disabled, low income families, and migrant workers 
in Singapore.
	
◾
For the second year in a row, Flow Traders was a sponsor 
of the Wall Street Rides For Autism Research. 
This cycling event brings the financial community 
together to benefit the Autism Science Foundation, 
who are committed to funding research to look not only 
for possible causes but also better ways to treat autism 
and enhance the quality of life for those affected. 
Alongside the company support, six employees 
participated and raised and donated additional funds.
	
◾
Flow Traders partnered with Rescuing Leftover Cuisine, 
Inc. to help fight against starvation amongst New 
Yorkers in 2019. We donated $3,960 worth of food to 
local shelters.
	
◾
At the end of 2019, all employees were able to donate 
€300 to a charity of their choice instead of receiving a 
personal Christmas gift. As a result, more than 85 
charitable organizations received donations. 
	
◾
Our employees also take part in sports events to raise 
awareness and donations for a range of different 
charities.

Stakeholder engagement
We enter the public dialogue with full transparency. 
Our contributions to the regulatory dialogue are typically 
made public and we are always willing to discuss what we do, 
and how that impacts the world around us. We have 
extensive dialogues with interest groups, including those 
focusing on transparency, institutional and retail 
shareholder interests, academia and students, local 
governments, regulators and anyone else who has an 
interest in what we do, and how we do it. We commit to being 
approachable and fully transparent with the goal to promote 
fairness, transparency and the orderly functioning of the 
financial markets.
Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations (UN) has identified 17 SDGs that are 
designed to help bring peace and prosperity for people and 
the planet as we work collectively towards the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development. In 2019 we identified three 
SDGs that we believe are pertinent for Flow Traders:

Outlook
Our aim is to continue to look for ways to strengthen our 
CSR focus areas. Looking ahead, we will consider carrying 
out a materiality analysis to identify those topics that are 
most material for the company and our stakeholders. At the 
same time we will begin developing a sustainability strategy 
so that we can prioritize our future sustainability goals.
Going concern
Flow Traders, having made appropriate enquiries, consider 
that adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, 
therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the 2019 financial statements. In reaching these 
conclusions, the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 
2019 and the strong free cash flow of the Group, the Group’s 
ability to access capital markets and the principal risks 
facing the Group are taken into consideration. 
A commentary on the Group’s cash flows, financial position 
and liquidity for the year ended 31 December 2019 is set out 
on pages 78 to 119. The Group’s capital position is strong and 
therefore the Management Board believes that Flow Traders 
is well prepared for the future.

Capital management
The Management Board’s policy is to maintain a strong 
capital base well above the required margins in order to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. 
The Management Board monitors the return on capital as 
well as the level of dividends to shareholders while 
complying with prime broker and regulatory capital 
requirements.
The available capital in the trading companies is monitored 
on a daily basis to ensure that requirements are met at all 
times and sufficient capital is available to support the 
Group’s strategy.
Capital requirements
The Group needs to comply with capital requirements from 
its prime brokers, as well as regulatory capital requirements. 
Capital is being managed by the Group in order to maintain 
net liquidity (which represents the value of our trading 
positions, principally long and short positions in equity 
securities, plus cash and cash equivalents) in excess of our 
various capital requirements at all times, while 
simultaneously exceed the regulatory capital requirements.
Prime broker capital requirements
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain certain 
minimum capital levels. Prime brokers use various internal 
systems to calculate required capital amounts (e.g., the 
‘internal haircut model’ and the ‘margin based approach 
model’, both intending to ensure sufficient levels of risk 
allowances) and have different limits structure, pre-funding 
possibilities and cut-off times for wiring capital. 
The aggregate capital that the prime brokers require is 
significantly higher than their risk exposure. For example, 
we may clear two legs of one transaction through two 
different prime brokers. Even when the transaction is fully 
hedged (the risk is fully offset), each prime broker will still 
require capital for such position as if the risk is not being 
offset. The prime brokers cannot establish that the other 
prime broker has an offsetting position so they will charge 
a full capital requirement. This increases the capital they 
require us to maintain beyond what would be necessary. 
In addition, margin requirements of prime brokers are 
conservatively determined by the sophistication of their 
models and the regulatory requirements, which might not 
necessarily be efficient in respect of our business model and 
trading portfolios.
The following table sets out the capital required to be 
posted with our prime brokers, capital available (Net 
Liquidation value) and excess liquidity as of the dates

Regulatory capital requirements
The company and our subsidiary Flow Traders B.V. 
are subject to separate regulatory capital requirements in 
the Netherlands and our subsidiary Flow Traders U.S. LLC is 
subject to regulatory capital requirements in the United 
States. Flow Traders Asia Pte. Ltd. is exempt from regulatory 
capital requirements and Flow Traders Hong Kong Limited 
has a capital requirement in Hong Kong. Failure to comply 
with regulatory capital requirements could result in 
sanctions, including citations, fines, limits to our trading and 
revocation of a regulatory license. 
Starting 31 March 2018 the company meets the regulatory 
requirements of the EU Capital Requirement Regulation 
(CRR), which prescribes capital and reporting requirements. 
These regulatory capital requirements are supervised by the 
Dutch Central Bank in respect of Flow Traders B.V. and the 
company. The regulatory capital requirement consists of the 
requirements calculated under CRR, reflecting an 8 percent 
charge over risk weighted assets, and a Capital Conservation 
buffer of 2.5 percent, totaling 10.5 percent during 2019. 
The following graph sets out regulatory capital available, 
regulatory capital requirements and excess regulatory 
capital for Flow Traders N.V. as reported in regulatory filings 
as of the dates indicated.
All available capital is CET1, the quality highest capital, 
reflecting equity and retained earnings. In addition, as set 
out in the chapter Remuneration, part of our variable 
remuneration is fully discretionary and deferred over 
multiple instalments. If the company faces operational 
losses these variable compensation elements are reduced 
or forfeited entirely to cover for such loss. Although this is 
an important additional capital buffer, this is not reflected in 
the regulatory capital calculations above. 
Our Pillar III disclosures pursuant to CRR can be requested 
through our website www.flowtraders.com around the time 
the Financial Statements of our Dutch trading entity, 
Flow Traders B.V., have been approved and published, which 
is expected to be within the next months. 
Management and control
Our global capital position is managed on a daily and 
intra-day level by the Risk and Mid-Office department. 
The Risk and Mid Office department checks our positions 
and capital posted at every prime broker for correctness and 
compares these numbers with the relevant prime broker or 
regulatory requirements. Separately, the Finance 
department prepares a rolling 15-month forecast for our 
capital positions, every month. 
As part of our regulatory capital management cycle, the Risk 
and Mid-Office departments daily prepares a report that

reports this to the Dutch Central Bank annually. The Dutch 
Central Bank assesses the capital adequacy based on this 
report.
In control statement
The Management Board is responsible for designing and 
maintaining an adequate system for risk management and 
internal control. In order to facilitate this, the Risk and 
Mid-Office department assessed the controls in this process 
and reported its findings to the Management Board. These 
findings have been evaluated by the Management Board 
and by the Supervisory Board. For a more elaborate 
explanation of our efforts in this regard, please refer to the 
chapter Our governance.
On the basis of the above, and in accordance with best 
practice provision 1.4.3 of the Corporate Governance Code, 
and with due observance of the limitations stated below, 
we confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
	
◾
The annual report provides sufficient insights into any 
failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk 
management and control systems (see chapter Our 
governance);
	
◾
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial reporting does not contain 
any material inaccuracies (see chapter Our governance);
	
◾
Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justified that the financial reporting is 
prepared on a going concern basis (see chapters Value 
creation and strategy, Our performance and Financial 
statements); and
	
◾
The report states those material risks and uncertainties 
that are relevant to the expectation of the company’s 
continuity for the period of twelve months after the 
preparation of the report (see section Going Concern on 
page 33).
However, these systems cannot provide absolute certainty 
that no errors have occurred or that our targets will be 
achieved, or that a misstatement of Flow Traders’ financial 
statements can be prevented. 
Statement by the Management Board 
As required by section 5:25c of the Dutch Financial 
Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht) we state 
that according to the best of our knowledge:
	
◾
The financial statements present a true and fair view of 
the assets, the liabilities, the financial position and the 
results of Flow Traders N.V. and the companies included 
in the consolidation; and 
	
◾
The annual report provides a true and fair view of the 
position as at 31 December 2019 and the state of affairs 
during the financial year of Flow Traders N.V. and its 
affiliated companies, whose data have been included in 
its financial statements, and that the annual report 
describes the essential risks faced by Flow Traders N.V.

General
Two board members can jointly represent the company, 
reflecting the four-eyes principle we operate across the 
company: two persons must sign off on significant business 
decisions. The Management Board is charged with managing 
the company, subject to the limitations set out in the 
Articles of Association and the Management Board By-Laws.
The Management Board is responsible for the continuity of 
the company and is guided by the interests of the company 
and its business, taking into consideration the company’s 
long-term value creation and the interests of the company’s 
stakeholders, including our employees and our 
shareholders. This ensures decisions are made in a balanced 
manner. 
Management has formulated a strategy in line with the 
long-term value creation. Subsequently, Management is 
responsible for creating a culture that entails long-term 
value creation for the company. The Management Board is 
supervised by the Supervisory Board in this regard. 
Management is alert to indications of misconduct or 
irregularities and reviews related policies regularly. 
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Code, 
Management has also taken measures to avoid conflicts of 
interest. 
The members of the Management Board are eager to keep 
their knowledge and skills up to date and spend sufficient 
time on their duties and responsibilities.
The Management Board is also responsible for identifying 
and managing risks associated with the company’s strategy 
and activities. Management ensures that the company has 
adequate internal risk management and control systems in 
place. Moreover, the Management Board takes account of 
the effectiveness of the design and the operation of the 
internal risk management and control systems. The Internal 
Audit Function is the responsibility of Management. 
Management maintains regular contact with the Global 
Head of Internal Audit, responsible for the Internal Audit 
Function. 
Before the Management Board can approve any resolutions 
entailing a significant change in the identity or nature of the 
company, it must obtain the approval of the General 
Meeting. The Management Board also has to obtain the 
approval of the Supervisory Board for a number of 
resolutions specified in the Management Board By-Laws. 
Appointing and dismissing Management Board 
members
As set out in more detail in our Articles of Association and 
the Management Board By-Laws, the Supervisory Board 
makes a non-binding nomination or proposal to appoint, 
suspend or remove a Management Board member. 
Following a nomination by the Supervisory Board, 
the General Meeting can appoint members of the 
Management Board by an absolute majority of the votes 
cast, representing more than one third of the issued capital 
of the company. Appointment of a different candidate than 
the one proposed by the Supervisory Board requires an 
absolute majority of the votes cast at the General Meeting, 
representing at least 50 percent of the issued capital of the 
company. Management Board members are appointed for 
a maximum term of four years at a time. According to the 
Corporate Governance Code, there is no limitation in the 
duration of their entire service. Any (re)appointment of 
a member of the Management Board must be approved by 
the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). 
The General Meeting can suspend or remove a member of 
the Management Board upon a proposal by the Supervisory 
Board with an absolute majority of the votes cast. If votes 
within the Supervisory Board meeting tie on a proposed 
nomination, suspension, or dismissal, the General Meeting 
shall decide. Suspension or removal of a Management Board 
member, not proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires 
an absolute majority of the votes cast at the General 
Meeting, representing at least 50 percent of the issued 
capital of the company.
The functioning of the Management Board as a whole and 
the functioning of its members individually is evaluated 
several times per year. A succession plan for the 
Management Board is in place and discussed regularly. 
Moreover, we have a transparent procedure in place for the 
(re)appointment of Management Board members. 
Management Board members are appointed for a term of 
four years and may be reappointed for a term of a maximum 
of four years at a time. The Equal Opportunity Policy will be 
taken into account at each (re)appointment.

Supervisory Board or a former member of the Management 
Board. More than half of its members is independent. 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee drafts 
proposals for the company’s remuneration policy. 
It proposes the remuneration of the individual members of 
the Management Board to the Supervisory Board, 
and reviews the proposal of the Management Board of the 
of the issued capital of the company. Appointment of 
a different candidate than the one proposed by the 
Supervisory Board requires an absolute majority of the votes 
cast at the General Meeting, representing at least 50 
percent of the issued capital of the company. If votes within 
the Supervisory Board meeting tie on the proposed 
nomination, the General Meeting decides. Any appointment 
of a member of the Supervisory Board must be approved by 
the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). The DNB needs to be notified 
in writing in case of reappointments of members of the 
Supervisory Board.
Following a proposal by the Supervisory Board the General 
Meeting may suspend or remove members of the 
Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast. 
The suspension or removal of a Supervisory Board member 
without a proposal by the Supervisory Board requires an 
absolute majority of the votes cast at the General Meeting, 
representing at least 50 percent of the issued capital of the 
company. 
Internal organization
Committees
The Supervisory Board has an Audit Committee, 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee, Risk Committee, 
and Trading & Technology Committee. Each of the 
committees has a preparatory and/or advisory role to the 
Supervisory Board. They each report their findings to the 
Supervisory Board, which is ultimately responsible for all 
decision-making. Terms of Reference apply for each 
committee and the relevant Management Board members 
and relevant others having a standing invitation for each 
committee meeting.

Risk Committee
The duties of the Risk Committee include supervising and 
monitoring the operation of our internal risk management 
and control systems, and advising the Management Board 
on these operations. It reviews the company’s risk 
assessment processes and control systems, at least 
annually. The committee also monitors the manner in which 
the company’s risk management function is provided with 
adequate resources and appropriate access to information, 
bearing in mind that it should be able to function sufficiently 
independently from Management. The Risk Committee also 
undertakes preparatory work for the Supervisory Board’s 
decision-making regarding the supervision of the integrity 
and quality of the effectiveness of the company’s internal 
risk management and control systems. Subsequently, 
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal 
risk management and control systems are discussed with 
the Management Board, and reported to the Supervisory 
Board.
Dilemmas
We face a variety of dilemmas in our various roles as an entrepreneur, employer and listed 
company. In addition to applying internal rules and regulations, such as the Code of Conduct 
and the Whistleblower Policy, we try to assess and resolve any dilemmas by applying 
common sense, remaining aware of our role within society. However, some dilemmas are 
ongoing and require constant attention. One of the dilemmas we currently face is:
Maintaining our exceptional culture
Our internal culture is one of our most cherished strengths. Our entrepreneurial, innovative 
and team-oriented culture supports an open environment where everyone can be 
themselves, confident in the knowledge they can express their thoughts and ideas openly. 
Our dilemma is how to maintain this environment as the company grows. As we employ 
more people and expand geographically, it can become more challenging to maintain the 
‘family spirit’ and ensure everyone feels connected on the same level. We continue to carry 
out surveys to better understand how employees feel about Flow Traders, and whether they 
recognize and can relate to the culture, and discuss the importance of culture at the top 
levels of the organization.
The committee maintains regular contact with the 
company’s Risk and Mid-Office departments. In addition to 
the Management Board members, relevant others may, 
from time to time, be invited to attend the Risk Committee 
meetings. 
Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee is responsible for 
providing advice to the Management Board on the 
company’s development, performance and sustainability of 
its trading strategies. It is also responsible for reviewing the 
company’s technology budget, supervising the operation of 
the company’s security systems, and assessing the state of 
the company’s technology in terms of competitiveness and 
functionality at least once a year. The committee supervises 
the Management Board on the operations of the company’s 
security systems and related risks. It maintains regular 
contact with our trading and technology departments. 
The Management Board members and relevant others may, 
from time to time, be invited to the Trading & Technology 
Committee meetings.

Our risk management
Flow Traders’ Risk Management Framework 
(RMF) forms the foundation of our approach to 
managing risks. The RMF is documented in Flow 
Traders’ Risk Management Policy and is reviewed 
annually by our Management Board.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify and 
document potential risks which are inherent to trading in an 
automated environment. In the very dynamic environment 
of automated trading we designed our RMF in such a way 
that it is robust, efficient and transparent. In the figure 
below we summarize our stakeholders to which we are 
obliged to deliver such a framework.
The RMF helps us to ensure sufficient internal control and 
(internal) capital through a consistent, continuous and 
careful method for addressing, managing and prioritizing 
our key risks in the context of our enterprise-wide strategic 
objectives.

Risk category
Context
STRATEGIC RISKS
Business and Strategic 
risk
This concerns risk related to our strategy, business model and market conditions. Market activity risk is 
part of this risk as our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of the level of trading activity, or 
trading volumes, in the financial instruments in which we trade.
Compliance and 
regulatory risk
Compliance risk is the threat posed to a company’s earnings or capital as a result of violation or 
non-conformance with laws, regulations, or prescribed practices. It also concerns the risk of changing 
laws and regulations (regulatory risk).
In addition, it includes the risk that the integrity of the organization or its operations is jeopardized as a 
result of unethical behavior of the organization, its staff members or management.
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or 
products. Concentration risk also includes supplier dependency risks.
Legal risk
The legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from a claim, failure to adhere to legally binding agreements and 
requirements, or failure to adequately legally protect assets of the firm.
Reputation risk
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
IT risk
The IT risk concerns the risk of loss resulting from inadequate information technology and processing in 
terms of availability, manageability, integrity, controllability and continuity, insufficient protection, or 
inadequate IT strategy and policy or inadequate use.
IT security risk
This concerns risks relating to access management, cybersecurity and data integrity risks.
Operational risk
The operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people or 
from external events. The main driver of operational risk is human error.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that there is not sufficient trading capital or regulatory capital available. 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market prices; in particular, changes in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in trading in or issuing a financial 
instrument defaulting on an obligation.
Enterprise Risk Management
We aim for a good balance between our business activities, 
return on capital and related risks. Flow Traders’ Risk 
Management adopts its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
approach to ensure that our risk appetite and profile are 
integrated in our day-to-day operations and strategic, 
tactical and operational objective setting and decision 
making. 
Our ERM activities follow the annual cycle. Every year our 
Management Board sets its business targets following the 
strategic goals. Based on the targets and objectives, 
the Management Board formulates its risk appetite. 
The targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to the 
various departments within the company and are used to 
derive our strategic risks. 
We implement our Risk Management cycle to ensure that 
the residual risk profile is (and remains) in line with the set 
risk appetite. To achieve this, we perform risk (self-) 
assessments (RSA) to identify and assess current and newly 
arisen risks. Following the RSAs, the Management Board 
decides on the appropriate risk response.
Risk categories
We identify three general risk categories - Strategic risks, 
Operational risks and Financial risks - each with their own 
specific risks areas:

Risk Management Governance 
The effectiveness of risk management is unavoidably linked 
to commitment and integrity. It is therefore crucial that the 
Management Board, global and local department heads, 
and all Flow Traders employees are aware of the company’s 
risk exposure and their own responsibilities, as well as the 
responsibilities of Flow Traders as a whole.
Our risk management is embedded in the organization in line 
with the three lines of defense model.
The first line of defense is formed by Trading, Technology 
and Operations. These departments are crucial for the core 
processes within Flow Traders and are responsible for 
incorporating preventive and detective controls in the day to 
day trading and IT processes and for the continuous 
monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and trading controls.
The second line of defense is responsible for oversight and 
monitoring regarding risks, rules and requirements. 
Risk Management and Trading Compliance monitor and 
manage most of the preventive controls and Regulatory 
Compliance and Finance monitor and manage primarily 
detective controls. Together they are responsible for the 
continuous risk management of Flow Traders.
The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’ Internal 
Audit Function (IAF). They assess the design and operation 
of our internal risk management and control systems. 
The IAF carries out its audit work in accordance with the 
Group Internal Audit Charter, as approved and implemented 
in May, 2016.

Every year the Management Board sets its business targets 
following the strategic goals. The strategic goals are 
generally formulated in November/December. 
The Supervisory Board, together with the Management 
Board, approves the strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Supervisory Board is involved in the 
strategy setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are then 
translated into annual companywide, departmental and 
individual goals and discussed in an annual meeting with the 
Management Board and all Managing Directors.
Based on the targets and objectives, the Management Board 
formulates the risk appetite of the company.
The targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to the 
various departments within Flow Traders and are used to 
derive the company’s strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management cycle is implemented to 
ensure that the net risk profile is and stays in line with the 
set risk appetite. To do so, we perform RSAs to identify and 
assess current and newly arisen risks and compliance with 
applicable requirements. Following the RSAs, department 
heads in cooperation with the Management Board will 
decide on the appropriate risk response. The effects of the 
chosen risk responses will be monitored and every year the 
actual net risk profile will be mapped versus the appetite.
Risk reporting
We have a standing risk committee that continuously 
assesses the risks we face in our business, comprised of our 
Global Head of Risk and the Management Board. Aside from 
ongoing ad-hoc communication, there is a recurring meeting 
set up in which they discuss all risk assessments and risk 
proposals related to position limits, strategies, procedures,

Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or 
external events. Operational risk management is an integral 
part of Flow Traders’ management information and control 
systems. As our operational risks are concentrated in 
technology events at exchanges and clearing members, 
our investment in technology is important to mitigate those 
associated risks. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, 
high-performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new hardware 
and software. Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement improvements in 
both hardware and software on an ongoing basis. Controlled 
releases of hardware and software enhancements provide 
for minimal disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or updates 
of our trading software) is being developed is strictly 
separated from the environment in which such trading 
software operates in production. Access to the source code 
is strictly controlled and limited. Prior to releasing our 
trading software, or an update into the production 
environment, any element of our trading software is 
subjected to a review of its code, testing in an environment 
that is separate from our production environment, validation 
in limited production (processing a strictly limited number of 
trades) on one trading desk in respect of trading a single 
financial instrument, followed by more extensive testing 
across multiple desks and/or trading multiple financial 
instruments. Each step, and progressive steps, 
is documented. 
Supervisory Board, as all members of the Supervisory Board 
are members of the Risk Committee. For more information, 
please refer to the chapter Report of the Supervisory Board.
Key risks
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from unfavorable 
market movements, such as prices, when positions in 
financial instruments are held. The value of a financial 
instrument may fluctuate because of changes in factors 
such as equity prices, currency rates, future dividend 
expectations, interest rates and volatilities. Our hedging 
strategies, in combination with the use of straightforward 
products and continuous monitoring, aim to minimize this 
risk. Our trading philosophy is that we hedge our positions as 
perfectly as possible and therefore we minimalize exposures 
towards market. 
Market activity risk (business risk)
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of the level 
of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial 
instruments in which we trade, and the bid-ask spreads 
(which largely determine the profit on the trade, or margins, 
we capture). Trading volumes in securities, derivatives and 
other financial instruments on exchanges and in other 
trading venues worldwide are directly affected by factors 
beyond our control, including economic and political 
conditions, broad trends in business and finance, regulatory 
requirements, actions by central banks, and changes in the 
markets in which such transactions occur.
To cope with periods of little market activity, we diversify in 
products and markets traded. This is to safeguard that we 
are not too dependent on the levels of market activity in 
one asset class or product category. 
capital requirements and other requirements of prime 
brokers and market developments. Any major changes to 
our risk systems, strategies and limit setting must 
subsequently be approved by the Management Board. 
In addition to the standing risk committee, the company has 
a Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. All members of 
the Supervisory Board are members of this Risk Committee. 
The Management Board informs the Risk Committee of the 
Supervisory Board about the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems. This includes the 
reasonable assurance that the aforementioned systems do 
not contain any material inaccuracies. In addition, the tasks 
of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board includes 
supervision and monitoring, as well as advising the 
Management Board on the operation of the company’s 
internal risk management and control systems. The Risk 
Committee is also responsible for providing advice to the 
Management Board on the company’s development, 
performance, and sustainability of its trading strategies, 
as well as reviewing the risk of the company. It maintains 
regular contact with the company’s Trading and Risk and 
Operations departments. For more information on the 
responsibilities of our Risk Committee, please see the 
chapter Our governance.
Following a review of the company’s risk assessment 
processes, the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems has been identified as 
a priority and as a joint responsibility of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees. All risks relevant to each of the 
committees of the Supervisory Board are monitored in the 
Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. This means that 
the relevant items set out in best practice provision 1.4.1 of 
the Corporate Governance Code have been discussed by the

Regulatory risk
While we do not have clients and do not provide investment 
services or ancillary services to third parties, our markets 
and nearly all aspects of our business are heavily regulated. 
Where applicable, entities forming part of our group have 
obtained the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses. 
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in four 
international jurisdictions and in addition we have opened 
a branch office in London in 2018. As a group we currently 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we 
commence trading on new platforms, including platforms 
designated for trading digital assets. While many of such 
platforms remain unregulated, many have strongly 
improved their own onboarding procedures and 
counterparty identification procedures. While we believe our 
own procedures are strong and trading on such platforms is 
quite limited, the unregulated status of such platforms and 
their location in emerging economies makes them inherently 
less institutionalized and supervised than regulated 
platforms in developed economies.
We have a monitoring system in place to control undisrupted 
trading activities in real time. Multilayer monitoring is 
employed to avoid errors, but when these occur the relevant 
teams are notified via multiple notification channels. We rely 
on multiple third party service providers for business and 
market data. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with our 
proprietary techology platform, analyzing real-time pricing 
data, and is designed to ensure that our order activity is 
conducted within strict pre-determined trading and position 
limits. For example, our pre-trade risk controls are designed 
to prevent the trading engines from sending quotes which 
deviate from our pre-defined risk parameters, such as price 
and volume limits set by the Risk Management department, 
which keeps our ordering, trading and positions well within 
tolerance levels. Our monitoring tools reconcile trades, 
prices and positions against those of our exchanges and 
prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration tests 
by external experts. We have a comprehensive IT security 
system that is designed to protect us from attacks both 
from inside and outside the platform. Where we have 
a technical interface with institutions like our prime brokers 
and exchanges, the integrity of the connection between the 
systems and the data that is being exchanged is subject to 
prior conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, 
for instance, provides that each office acts as a back-up site 
for other offices.

including IFR/IFD, MiFID II, Brexit, post trading matters, 
market structure and market regulations. We will continue 
to contribute to these discussions and will persist in 
maximizing transparency in respect of our industry, 
its benefits for all market participants and fair, orderly and 
transparent financial markets.
Information on the remuneration of the Management Board 
members, and charity Supervisory Board members can be 
found in the chapter Remuneration.
Diversity
The Supervisory Board has drawn up and adopted an Equal 
Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy). In this policy we explain 
our objective to treat everyone equally during the hiring 
process and throughout their careers at Flow Traders. We are 
committed to being a truly equal opportunity employer, 
by recruiting, retaining and promoting people based on 
merit, and merit alone. We are a firm believer in the benefits 
of a diverse workplace and we do not make any concessions 
to quality. Our objective is to provide equal employment 
opportunities to all qualified job applicants and equal career 
perspectives for all of our employees, provided they 
perform highly. When positions become available, 
we actively encourage all candidates to apply and ensure 
that the selection and retention processes are truly equal 
for all applicants and employees. We aim to provide an 
inclusive work environment for all employees. This also 
holds for our Management Board and Supervisory Board. 
When it comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, we adhere to the same principles of 
equal opportunity as set out above. As a result, our current 
Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements could adversely affect our 
reputation, profitability and prospects. This may also be the 
case for differences in interpretation or lack of timely or 
complete implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, disgorgements and 
censures, suspension or expulsion from trading venues or 
the revocation or limitation of licenses. We aim to minimize 
such risks by focusing considerable management attention, 
employing highly-qualified compliance and risk 
professionals, deploying training, monitoring and reporting 
systems, and continuously evaluating and implementing 
current and upcoming regulation on our operations. 
Notwithstanding such efforts, given the highly regulated 
nature of our business, we are regularly subject to routine 
(and sometimes more targeted) inquiries and audits from 
regulators and trading venues. It is difficult to predict or 
manage the outcome of such inquiries, although we aim to 
be as transparent and cooperative as possible given the 
circumstances.
We continuously invest in good professional relationships 
with trading venues, regulators and other relevant parties. 
Flow Traders is a founding member of the FIA European 
Principal Traders Association (FIA EPTA), a member of the 
FIA Principal Traders Group (FIA PTG) in the US and 
a member of FIA Asia. These are industry groups that consist 
of leading principal trading firms. We are also a member of 
the Dutch Association of Proprietary Traders (APT), 
operating as an industry body of Netherlands-based 
liquidity providers. As part of these important groups, 
we continue to promote, foremost, the principle that all 
markets and market participants should be adequately and 
transparently regulated. Within these groups we contribute 
to discussions regarding current and new regulations 
trade on more than 180 venues worldwide. In addition, 
we operate on various venues through brokers. As we have 
to comply with our home regulations, local regulations and 
trading rules of all venues on which we trade, our regulatory 
landscape is vast. Legislators and regulators worldwide 
strengthen their supervision within our environment, 
demanding a professional and well-structured compliance 
organization.
Our Regulatory Compliance department assists 
management and operations at group and local level by 
identifying, advising on, reviewing and reporting on 
regulations. It also seeks to maintain a compliant business 
environment through training and monitoring in order to 
ensure and enhance the group’s conformance with its 
regulatory obligations. 
The Trading Compliance and Risk and Operations 
departments have promulgated and implemented 
pre-trade risk controls, internal rules and regulations that 
were developed following regulatory requirements, 
guidelines from market authorities, industry best practices 
and our own best practices. Laws and regulations, including 
tax laws, are subject to change or can be interpreted 
differently in practice over time. Currently, the European 
Commission, European Parliament and European member 
states are negotiating implementing regulation pertaining to 
new prudential requirements for investment firms (IFR/IFD). 
IFR/IFD and their implementation may affect our Dutch 
trading entity and our Group. We expect more certainty 
about the outcome during the course of 2020 and early 
2021. We cannot predict the outcome of such regulatory 
developments and are closely following relevant 
developments.

of three Supervisory Board members, granting the authority 
to issue shares and the authority to restrict or exclude 
pre-emptive rights (see below for more detail), granting the 
authority to acquire own shares and the authority to cancel 
own shares (see below) and reappointing EY as our external 
auditor. The General Meeting and Management Board 
discussed the results, dividend policy, remuneration policy 
and governance structure of the company. 
Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders will be held 
if the Management Board or the Supervisory Board is 
requested to that effect in writing by one or more holders of 
shares (or holders of rights in rem (beperkte rechten) who 
also hold the voting rights in relation to those shares) 
individually or jointly representing ten percent or more of 
the issued share capital, specifying the details to be 
discussed. 
The company held no Extraordinary General Meeting in 
2019. Our next AGM is scheduled to be held on 24 April, 
2020, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. More information will 
become available on our website in due course.
Voting rights
Each share carries one vote at the AGM. Subject to certain 
exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles of 
Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed 
by an absolute majority of votes cast. Votes can be cast at 
the AGM either in person or by proxy. These proxies can be 
granted electronically or in writing to the company or to 
independent third parties, such as a civil-law notary.
Management Board and the Supervisory Board for their 
performance during the previous financial year. 
In accordance with the implementation of the Shareholders 
Rights Directive into Dutch law, the remuneration report 
and, every 4 years, the remuneration policy will be included 
on the agenda for the AGM, starting at the 2020 AGM.
General Meetings of Shareholders can be held as often as 
the Management Board or the Supervisory Board deem 
necessary. A General Meeting of Shareholders is also 
convened in case of a decision entailing a significant change 
in the identity or character of the company or its business. 
One or more shareholders representing at least the 
statutory threshold of three percent of the voting rights may 
request that the Management Board places items on the 
agenda of a General Meeting of Shareholders. 
The Management Board must honor such a request 
provided that the request is received in writing at least 60 
days before the date of such a meeting. 
Each shareholder is entitled – either in person or via proxy – 
to attend the AGM and to vote during the AGM. The AGM is 
the perfect place for shareholders and the Management 
Board and Supervisory Board to interact. At an AGM, 
shareholders can ask questions directly to the Management 
Board and/or the Supervisory Board. Our Management 
Board and Supervisory Board strongly encourage 
shareholders to interact. 
During the AGM held on 8 May 2019 in Amsterdam, 
the Netherlands, shareholders voted in favor of adopting 
the 2018 annual accounts, determining the total dividend at 
€2.35 per share, discharging members of the Management 
Board and Supervisory Board from liability, reappointment 
education, nationality, and professional backgrounds. 
This diverse composition entails constructive dialogues and 
shared responsibility, resulting in an effective and efficient 
Supervisory Board. Our Equal Opportunity Policy can be 
found on our website: www.flowtraders.com. 
General Meeting, shares and shareholders 
Flow Traders highly encourages shareholder participation in 
the decision-making of the General Meeting. It is of great 
importance to the company that its shareholders have an 
actual say in the Annual General Meeting of shareholders 
(AGM), and the company therefore encourages an open 
dialogue. Flow Traders ensures that the General Meeting is 
adequately provided with information.
Agenda items of the AGM that need to be handled as 
separate agenda items on the basis of the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Dutch Civil Code or the Articles of 
Association will be handled as such. 
Flow Traders holds an AGM within six months following the 
end of the financial year. The agenda for this meeting 
includes the adoption of the annual accounts, the content of 
the annual report covering the previous year’s financial 
business, the policy of the company on additions to reserves 
and on distributions of profits, any proposal to distribute 
profits, (re)appointment of the external auditor, substantial 
changes in the governance structure of the company and in 
the compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, 
material changes to the Articles of Association, filling 
vacancies on the Management Board and/or Supervisory 
Board, proposals placed on the agenda by the Management 
Board, and the release from liability of the members of the

At the 2020 AGM the Management Board will propose to the 
General Meeting to (i) renew its authorization to repurchase 
shares in the company, and (ii) cancel shares in the share 
capital of the Company held or repurchased by the Company 
under the aforementioned authorization to repurchase 
shares in the Company.
Cancelation of shares
Shares may be canceled by the company by a decision of the 
Management Board. This decision must be approved by the 
Supervisory Board. During the 2019 AGM, our shareholders 
voted for the authorization of the Management Board to, 
subject to the Supervisory Board’s approval, cancel shares in 
the share capital of the company. The number of shares that 
can be canceled, shall be determined by the Management 
Board, but may not exceed ten percent of the issued share 
capital at 9 May 2019, i.e. up to 465,345 shares can be 
canceled. The cancelation may be executed in one or more 
parts. 
Major shareholders
The following shareholders filed their interests in the capital 
of the company exceeding 3% to be included in the AFM’s 
register of substantial holdings and gross short positions as 
published on the website www.afm.nl (data as published on 
31 December 2019). A shareholder must file or update its 
holdings if its interest exceeds, or drops below, 3%, 5%, 10%, 
15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. 
Based on the publications in two of the public AFM 
Registers: the Register on substantial holdings and gross 
short positions; and the Register on notifications by directors 
and members of the supervisory board, the table below 
shows the most accurate formation. For further details on 
individual shareholdings please refer to the AFM’s registers.
rights when issuing ordinary shares or granting rights to 
subscribe for ordinary shares up to and including 
8 November 2020. 
At our next AGM, scheduled to be held on 24 April 2020, 
the Management Board intends to request that the General 
Meeting renews its authorization to issue shares for up to 
ten percent of the total number of shares issued at the time 
of the AGM for any purposes.
Repurchase and purchase of shares
Shares may be repurchased by the company by a decision of 
the Management Board. This decision must be approved by 
the Supervisory Board. During the 2019 AGM, 
our shareholders renewed the authority of the Management 
Board to, subject to the Supervisory Board’s approval, 
acquire shares in the capital of the company, either through 
purchase on a stock exchange or otherwise. The authority 
applies up to and including 8 November 2020, under the 
following conditions: the repurchase (i) may constitute up to 
ten percent of the total number of shares issued at the time 
of the General Meeting; (ii) provided that the company will 
not hold more shares in stock than ten percent of the issued 
share capital; and (iii) at a price (excluding expenses) not less 
than the nominal value of the shares and not higher than the 
opening price on Euronext Amsterdam on the day of 
repurchase plus ten percent. Any repurchases exceeding 
these limits need approval by the General Meeting.
In order to align our employees’ interests with those of our 
shareholders, the company awards 100 shares in the 
company to most employees with a tenure of over two 
years. The company purchased part of such shares under the 
authority granted by the General Meeting over the course of 
2018 and 2019. 
Amendment to the Articles of Association
The General Meeting may pass a resolution to amend the 
Articles of Association or to wind up the company with an 
absolute majority of the votes cast. This can only be done if 
the Management Board has proposed to amend the Articles 
of Association or wind up the company. Such proposal has to 
be approved by the Supervisory Board.
When a proposal to amend the Articles of Association or to 
wind up the company is made to the General Meeting, 
the intention to propose such resolution must be stated in 
the relevant notice convening the General Meeting. If it 
concerns an amendment to the Articles of Association, 
a copy of the proposal in which the proposed amendment is 
quoted verbatim must at the same time be deposited at the 
company’s office and this copy shall be made available for 
inspection by the shareholders until the end of the General 
Meeting.
Issue of shares
Shares are issued by a decision of the Management Board. 
This decision must be approved by the Supervisory Board. 
During the 2019 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Management Board, subject to the 
Supervisory Board’s approval, to issue ordinary shares or to 
grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares up to and 
including 8 November 2020 for up to ten percent of the 
total number of shares issued at the time of the General 
Meeting of Shareholders for any purposes. Any issuance 
exceeding this limit needs approval by the General Meeting.
In addition, the General Meeting renewed the authority of 
the Management Board, subject to the Supervisory Board’s 
approval, to restrict or exclude applicable pre-emptive

relationship agreement (as described above). Furthermore, 
the parties agreed to reserve the right to consult with each 
other and coordinate the exercise of their voting rights 
attached to their respective shares in the company. 
The shareholders’ agreement terminates for any party if 
such party’s aggregate shareholding in the company (be it 
direct or indirect) falls below three percent of the company’s 
outstanding share capital and in case of, among other things, 
the company becoming subject to insolvency procedures, 
liquidation, delisting, a merger or spin-off (with the company 
as disappearing entity).

Flow Traders does not employ any of the following 
dedicated take-over protection structures: preference 
shares, depositary receipts or call options issued to vehicles 
conducive to protecting the company’s interest or 
independence.

Investments B.V. shall be entitled to jointly designate one 
Supervisory Board member for appointment. 
The relationship agreement also governs the composition of 
the Supervisory Board committees. The agreement 
terminates in respect of each of the shareholders, if such 
party’s aggregate shareholding in the company (be it direct, 
indirect or together with a permitted transferee) falls below 
five percent of the company’s outstanding share capital. 
In case of, among other things, the company becoming 
subject to insolvency procedures, liquidation, delisting, 
a merger or a spin-off (with the company as disappearing 
entity), the agreement automatically terminates.
Under the shareholders’ agreement governed by Dutch law, 
Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. have agreed

Compliance and transparency
Focus on anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
Flow Traders is a strong proponent of effective, efficient and 
equal regulation and contributes to the regulatory dialogue 
in our key jurisdictions as we want markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
We commit to complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations that apply to us, wherever we operate, including 
in respect of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering laws. Integrity and transparency is central to the 
way we run our business, from our Management Board and 
Supervisory Board to all our staff, regardless of their role. 
The company encourages an open culture within its 
organization and expects its employees to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations and internal policies. 
Each employee is responsible for ensuring an honest and 
ethical conduct of business within the company. We have 
issued a Code of Conduct, which forms part of our 
employment documentation. This Code of Conduct can be 
found on our website www.flowtraders.com.
We have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering (AML) policies in place that apply to all our staff. 
We expect our counterparties, business partners, 
intermediaries, contractors and subcontractors to adhere to 
the same standards. We believe that the risk of bribery or 
corruption is very limited as we do not hold or manage client 
money or assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain production 
facilities or source raw materials. Nevertheless, staff 
receives training in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and AML 
practices, as the Management Board underlines the 
importance of these trainings.
Key to our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy is that 
officials or counterparties may never be placed in an 
uncomfortable position. No gifts nor favors may lead (or 
have the appearance to lead) to obligations or embarrass 
any recipient, and no gifts nor favors of any substantial 
value may be given to authorities. Facilitation payments are 
not permitted. We provide clear and recurring guidance in 
that respect. As part of our constant monitoring, 
all expenses and gifts relating to external parties are 
checked by senior managers and employees have to state 
what the purpose of an expense was and who was the 
recipient.
We have zero tolerance towards bribery and corruption and 
we actively ensure that no such behavior occurs. No cases of 
bribery or corruption were reported in 2019.
Whistleblowers
In addition to our very strong culture of openness, 
transparency and participation, we also have an elaborate 
Whistleblower Policy in place for all staff and relevant 
contractors, approved by the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. Employees are free to raise issues and 
have the responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, 
or any reasonable suspicions. During 2018, all employees 
were required to participate in an online course on the 
Whistleblower Policy, as part of the Flow Academy. During 
2019 every new hire received this course, and every new hire 
will receive this course going forward, to create awareness 
and guidance on how to deal with misconducts and incidents 
described in Flow Traders whistleblower policy.
 
Circumstances may arise that cause an employee to feel 
insecure or unsafe to the extent that they may not want to 
use the usual reporting lines. The company provides 
employees with a safe way of reporting suspected 
misconducts within its organization and offers adequate 
protection. The Whistleblower Policy has wide applications, 
including in respect of topics such as fraud, market abuse, 
corruption, anti-money laundering, theft, bribery, 
dishonoring Flow Traders Global tax policy and any other 
structural misconduct that threatens the integrity and 
proper business conduct of Flow Traders. The Whistleblower 
Policy provides whistleblowers with anonymity, 
confidentiality, and the company will not impose sanctions 
on disclosure (or affect an employee’s legal position) when 
the employee reports a suspected misconduct in good faith, 
unless the employee is involved in the issue that is being 
reported. We respect a non-retaliation policy when 
a suspected misconduct is reported. Flow Traders’ 
Whistleblower Policy can be found on our website  
www.flowtraders.com.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit Function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and objective 
assurance, advice, and insight. An efficient and effective 
internal audit framework contributes to strong internal 
controls and to a robust corporate governance structure, 
which can address significant risks. The scope of internal 
audit work includes the examination and evaluation of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of Flow Traders’ risk 
management, control and governance processes as well as 
the quality of performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve Flow Traders’ stated goals and 
objectives. 
Our Group Internal Audit Charter defines the Internal Audit 
Function’s purpose, authority, responsibility and position 
within Flow Traders. This charter is aligned with the

Corporate Governance Code and with guidance provided by 
the Institute of Internal Auditors. 
The Internal Audit Function is an integral part of our 
reporting cycle. The Internal Audit Function reports to the 
Audit Committee and to the CEO. It aligns its efforts with the 
external auditor and reports its audit results to the 
Management Board, the essence of its audit results to the 
Audit Committee and informs the external auditor. 
The Management Board assesses the way in which the 
Internal Audit Function fulfils its responsibility annually and 
takes the opinion of the Audit Committee into account.
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
The Corporate Governance Code defines a company as 
a long-term form of collaboration between the principal 
corporate bodies of a company. For Flow Traders, these 
corporate bodies include the Management Board, 
the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting. 
The Management Board values and considers the interests 
of the various stakeholders involved. Good corporate 
governance results in effective decision-making in a manner 
which enhances shareholder value and enables a company 
to maintain a culture of integrity, transparency, and trust. 
The company has a long standing focus on a long-term 
value creation strategy, culture and risk. We acknowledge 
the importance of good corporate governance and endeavor 
to comply in general with the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code and comply fully with it, with the 
exception of the following provisions: 
	
◾
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
Best practice provision 2.1.5 provides that the 
Supervisory Board should draw up a diversity policy for 
the composition of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. The policy should address the 
concrete targets relating to diversity. Flow Traders 
deviates from best practice provision 2.1.5 as no 
concrete targets are set on diversity within the 
company. However, the Supervisory Board has drawn up 
and adopted an Equal Opportunity Policy addressing 
the diversity aspects of the composition of the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. We believe 
that this policy also attains the purpose of best practice 
provision 2.1.5. In our view, the policy contributes to 
good governance, as it reflects our objective to treat 
everyone equally during the hiring process and 
throughout their careers at Flow Traders. Flow Traders is 
committed to being a truly equal opportunity employer, 
by recruiting, retaining and promoting people based on 
merit, and merit alone. The company is a firm believer in 
the benefits of a diverse workplace and does not make 
any concessions to quality. The objective is to provide 
equal employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all 
employees, provided they perform highly. 
When positions become available, Flow Traders actively 
encourages all candidates to apply and ensure that the 
selection and retention processes are truly equal for all 
applicants and employees. This also holds for the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it 
comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, Flow Traders adheres to the same 
principle of equal opportunity as set out above. 
As a result, our current Supervisory Board is diverse in 
terms of, inter alia, age, education, nationality, 
and professional backgrounds.

◾
Analyses carried out in respect of variable 
compensation
Best practice provision 3.2.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code provides that the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee should submit a proposal to 
the Supervisory Board concerning the remuneration of 
individual members of the Management Board. 
The proposal is drawn up in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy that has been established and will, 
in any event, cover the remuneration structure, 
the amount of the fixed and variable remuneration 
components, the performance criteria used, 
the scenario analyses that are carried out and the pay 
ratios within the company and its affiliated enterprises. 
We do not fully comply with the scenario analyses that 
are carried out as the variable remuneration for the 
members of the Management Board is contingent upon 
a future, unknown, metric: the accrued firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool which itself depends on 
operating result for the given financial year. Because of 
the nature of our business activities and the fast paced 
industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable compensation 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year 
while performing a single, one-off assessment at the 
end of the year as set out in the best practice 
provisions. Semi-annual discussions take place 
between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee for this 
purpose. In this manner, the Supervisory Board 
regularly assesses the performance indicators and the 
potential resulting variable compensation for the 
Management Board members. Targets are set for each 
	
◾
Independence of Supervisory Board members
Best practice provision 2.1.7 provides that any one of the 
criteria referred to in best practice provision 2.1.8 (i.-v.) 
should be applicable to at most one Supervisory Board 
member and that the total number of Supervisory 
Board members to whom the criteria referred to in best 
practice provision 2.1.8 are applicable, should account 
for less than half of the total number of Supervisory 
Board Members. Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius, 
as founders of the company, were attracted to their 
role as Supervisory Board members because of their 
specific business-related expertise. They do not qualify 
as independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they are former members of the 
Management Board of the company prior to its 
conversion and because they represent shareholders of 
the company owning an interest of over ten percent. 
Deviation from this provision is likely to continue until 
Roger Hodenius and Jan van Kuijk cease to be members 
of the Supervisory Board.
	
◾
Independence of committee members
As Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent Supervisory Board members as set out 
above, this also affects two Supervisory Board 
committees of which they are members. Best practice 
provision 2.3.4 provides that more than half of the 
members of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee should be 
independent. Both Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius are 
members of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, implying that half (and not more than half) 
of its members are independent. Deviation from this 
provision is likely to continue until Roger Hodenius and 
Jan van Kuijk cease to be members of the Supervisory 
Board.

Quorum
Best practice provision 4.3.3 provides that the General 
Meeting of a company that is not subject to the 
statutory large company regime (structuurregime) may 
adopt a resolution to cancel the binding nature of 
a nomination for the appointment of a member of the 
Management Board or of the Supervisory Board and/or 
a resolution to remove a member of the Management 
Board or of the Supervisory Board by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast. According to the Corporate 
Governance Code, it may be provided that this majority 
should represent a given proportion of the issued 
capital, which proportion may not exceed one-third. 
If this proportion of the capital is not represented at the 
meeting, but an absolute majority of the votes cast is in 
favor of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of 
a nomination or to remove a board member, a new 
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may 
be passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
regardless of the proportion of the capital represented 
at the meeting. 
In deviation of this best practice provision, 
the company’s Articles of Association provide that the 
General Meeting may pass a resolution to cancel the 
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of 
a member of the Management Board or of the

The Fixed Income ETF market has grown 
strongly in recent years, with investors 
keen to take advantage of the tradability, 
liquidity and transparency the products 
offer. According to iShares (BlackRock) 
Fixed Income ETF assets might double in 
the coming 5 years from the current 
$1 trillion.
For Flow Traders, which has developed 
strongly in the Fixed Income ETF market 
recently, there is still significant growth 
potential to be realized. Ramon Baljé, 
Head of Fixed Income Europe and 
Matheus Pereira, Head of Trading US, 
discuss the market’s importance and Flow 
Traders’ role within it. 
Let’s start with the basics: What is a Fixed 
Income ETF?
Matheus: ‘Fixed Income ETFs enable 
investors to buy a slice of securities, in this 
case bonds. These can be in any type of 
Fixed Income security available in the 
market, from government bonds to 
corporate bonds. Because they are ETFs 
they can be traded in the market like an 
open ended share. But unlike mutual 
funds, which tend to be available for 
trading at the end of the day only, Fixed 
Incomes ETFs have the advantage of being 
tradeable throughout the day.’
So ease of trading is the main advantage 
Fixed Income ETFs have over bonds? 
Ramon: ‘Being easier to trade than the 
underlying bonds is just one of the 
advantages of ETFs. Another key benefit is 
greater insight into their liquidity. Because

most bonds are traded over the counter rather than on 
exchanges, it is very difficult to accurately measure their 
liquidity. Fixed Income ETFs provide investors with 
accurate data on volumes traded, meaning there is far 
greater price transparency.’
What else attracts investors to Fixed Income ETFs?
Matheus: ‘Since Fixed Income ETFs pay the accumulated 
coupons throughout the month, if investors hold a basket 
of funds they can create income on a monthly basis. This is 
an attractive option for many. Another new trend is to 
create tax efficient solutions within the ETF, for example 
by building a portfolio that includes products that are 
either taxed attractively or are even exempt of tax in their 
own jurisdiction. This provides investors with a great deal 
of flexibility and transparency.’
What is Flow Traders’ position in the Fixed Income ETF 
market? 
Ramon: ‘Our market position was significant in 2019, over 
15% globally. Our ground-breaking technology and our 
heavy presence trading underlying bonds sets us apart 
from our market peers, and we see huge growth potential 
within the Fixed Income ETF space. 
According to iShares (BlackRock) the market is forecast to 
double in terms of assets under management (AuM) in the 
comping few years, and recent net inflows have been 
massive. New products, such as iShares High Yield Bond 
Series and the JP Morgan US Aggregate Bond ETF, are 
helping fuel this growth. 
We are also seeing other market participants, such as 
hedge funds, moving into Fixed Income ETFs to reduce 
the cash drag on their funds. What does that mean? Well, 
because the ETF is especially liquid the hedge funds use 
the ETFs as a placeholder for cash, creating a win-win 
situation.’
Finally, any other changes that will help the market grow? 
Matheus: ‘Another recent development that is highly 
significant is the introduction of the ETF Rule in the United 
States. This brings greater consistency and transparency 
to the ETF market, making it easier for new participants to 
enter the market and issue funds, and should give a real 
boost to the Fixed Income ETF market.’

Message of the Supervisory Board
Message of the Chairman
In 2019 the Supervisory Board, among other matters, 
focused on monitoring and advising the management board 
on the implementation of the company’s long-term value 
creation strategy. 
The Supervisory Board in 2019
During 2019 the Supervisory Board concentrated on a variety 
of topics as part of guiding the company as it develops and 
realizes its strategic ambition. This involved discussing the 
financial results, the regulatory environment, investments 
to optimize the company’s structure, overseeing additional 
control procedures and cybersecurity. Alongside this, it dealt 
with a range of additional subjects at its regular meetings 
and within its four committees: The Audit Committee, 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee, Trading and 
Technology Committee, and the Risk Committee.
Regulatory changes were deliberated extensively. 
Key among these were the EU Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR) and the Shareholder Rights Directive II 
(SRD II). SRD II aims to strengthen the position of 
shareholders. This includes giving shareholders the right to 
vote every 4 years on the remuneration policy for the 
management board and supervisory board members and to 
provide an advisory vote annually on the remuneration 
report. The CRR stipulates capital and liquidity requirements 
relevant to Flow Traders. The upcoming new prudential 
requirements under IFR and IFD were also discussed. 
The company conforms to the CRR and prime broker 
requirements, highlighting its solid capital base. Over the

course of the year the Supervisory Board also scrutinized 
the company’s move into additional asset classes, including 
Fixed Income. This involved discussing the impact, 
the required management and oversight, and the main risks 
and benefits such steps will have. 
Other important discussion topics were the company’s 
future growth profile culture and core values, succession 
planning and diversity, including gender diversity. 
Flow Traders’ hiring criteria always involves finding the most 
qualified and talented candidates, irrespective of amongst 
others ethnic background, gender, sexuality or religion in 
accordance with the company’s Equal Opportunity Policy. 
This year the company welcomed the first women to its 
trading team, as it hired three female traders. Two have 
already started in 2019, the third one is scheduled to start in 
our New York office in 2020. Succession planning for both 
the Management Board and the Supervisory Board was also 
discussed, in light of the shift to a single CEO following 
Sjoerd Rietberg’s decision not to seek reappointment. 
The Supervisory Board would like to acknowledge Sjoerd’s 
contribution and thank him for his long-term efforts at the 
company.
Looking ahead
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2020, the Supervisory 
Board will continue to monitor the implementation of the 
company’s strategy, while tracking regulatory 
developments, including upcoming prudential requirements 
under IFR and IFD, practical implementation of CSDR and 
the MiFID II revision. Another key area of focus is ensuring 
that the company operates in as efficient manner as 
possible. Given Flow Traders operates within a dynamic and 
fast changing environment, talent retention is essential so 
that the company has the awareness and ability to react 
accordingly and appropriately. 
Han Sikkens, whose term expires in 2020, has conveyed to 
the Supervisory board his intention to not stand for 
reappointment. Furthermore, in 2020 we are delighted to 
welcome Britta Achmann to the company and the 
management board as Chief Risk Officer, subject to 
shareholders approval.
Regards, 
Eric Drok
Chairman of the Supervisory Board

Meetings of the Supervisory Board 
In 2019 the Supervisory Board members met seven times to 
hold formal Supervisory Board meetings and met several 
times without holding a formal meeting. Examples of 
meetings without holding a formal meeting include 
a preparation session for the AGM, education and strategy 
days and the self-assessment day. During these meetings 
a number of topics, including the following, were discussed:
	
◾
The company’s strategy 
The company’s Management Board focuses on the 
long-term value creation of the company and has 
involved the Supervisory Board in translating this 
long-term value creation into the company’s strategy. 
The Supervisory Board regularly discusses the strategy, 
the implementation of the strategy, and any associated 
risks. This includes the merger of the dealing rooms in 
Asia. In August 2019, the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board went off-site to comprehensively 
discuss the company’s strategy and related long-term 
value creation. The Supervisory Board agreed on 
financial and non-financial KPIs of the Management 
Board, these KPIs are further explained in the chapter 
Our governance.
	
◾
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the company’s risk assessment processes 
and the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems remain a priority and 
joint responsibility of the Supervisory Board and all 
committees. The assessment comprises an overview of 
all relevant risks the company is exposed to, 
Supervisory Board report
the internal controls in place to address these risks, 
and the Management Board’s views on such risks. 
	
◾
Succession planning and diversity
The terms of three Supervisory Board members expired 
in 2019. The terms of one Supervisory Board member 
will expire in 2020, hence succession planning of the 
Supervisory Board formed an important topic of 
discussion during the Supervisory Board and 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee meetings. 
Following the transition from five Management Board 
members to three Management Board members during 
2019, the succession planning of the Management 
Board was also discussed. When discussing succession 
planning, the company’s Equal Opportunity Policy is 
always taken into account.
	
◾
Culture and core values
Culture has always and will always form a very 
important role within Flow Traders. Culture and the 
company’s core values have been regularly discussed 
during the Remuneration & Appointment Committee 
meetings and the Supervisory Board meetings. 
The Whistleblower Policy and the company’s Code of 
Conduct and the awareness of employees thereof have 
been discussed often during the year.
	
◾
New legislation and regulation
The Supervisory Board was regularly updated and 
discussed upcoming regulation and implementation of 
new regulation. This includes the revision of the 
European capital and remuneration requirements set 
out in the EU Investment Firm Regulation and EU 
Investment Firm Directive and the implementation of 
the Shareholders Rights Directive II. During the 
Supervisory Board meetings, there were regular 
updates on specific projects and the company’s 
regulatory capital requirements under CRR and other 
prime broker capital requirements.
	
◾
Financial results
The Supervisory Board was updated on the company’s 
financial, legal and compliance risks through the Audit 
Committee and the Risk Committee. Other topics 
discussed were the annual, half-yearly and quarterly 
results.
	
◾
The company’s governance structure and related 
documentation
Each year the Supervisory Board assesses all of the 
company’s policies, By-Laws and Terms of Reference of 
each of the committees. In 2019 the By-Laws of the 
Supervisory Board and the Management Board were 
reviewed, amended and re-adopted twice, as well as 
the Terms of Reference of the Audit, Risk and Trading & 
Technology Committee. In 2019, a new related party 
transaction policy was adopted.
	
◾
Industry-related updates
Relevant updates and educations sessions were 
provided by the heads of specific departments and 
external advisors. This included updates and education 
sessions about cybersecurity and new asset classes. 
	
◾
Large investments
The Management Board explained and discussed any 
large investments with the Supervisory Board.

the independence of the board members Olivier Bisserier, 
Rudolf Ferscha, Eric Drok and Han Sikkens. Roger Hodenius 
and Jan van Kuijk were considered non-independent 
Supervisory Board members. For additional information, 
please refer to the chapter Our governance. 
Evaluation of the Management Board 
The performance of the CEO is discussed at least two times 
a year between two Supervisory Board members. 
The performance of the CTrO and the CTO are discussed at 
least two times a year between a Supervisory Board member 
and the CEO. During performance discussions, 
the representatives speak with the Management Board 
members individually and with the Management Board as 
a whole. Guiding structures for these conversations include 
the Management Board KPI overview, the strategic project 
goals set for 2019, culture and team performance. Based on 
these discussions the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee provides feedback regarding its view on the 
Management Board’s performance to the Supervisory 
Board, to guide year-end discussions on variable rewards.
Evaluation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of the 
self-assessment of 2018, and the follow-up on conclusions 
of that self-assessment. As a result of the conclusions of 
the 2018 assessment, the Supervisory Board continued the 
initiative launched in 2018 to host a dedicated Strategy Day. 
Additionally, the Supervisory Board ensured a clear link 
between the company KPI’s and its strategy. 
In 2019 the Supervisory Board also reviewed its own 
performance using a combination of an electronic survey 
and a group discussion. Using the same questionnaire year 
over year enabled comparisons with last year’s results. 
Compared to 2018, the Supervisory Board concluded that it 
has continued to function well. Specific items for follow up 
that arose this year included continued focus on strategy, 
the composition of the Supervisory Board and in-depth 
knowledge of the business of Flow Traders and its 
regulatory environment. 
The Supervisory Board’s self-assessment includes an 
independence-assessment. The independence assessment 
in 2019 was led by Eric Drok as independent Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board and Rudolf Ferscha as independent 
Chairman of the Remuneration & Appointment Committee. 
Following the assessment, the Supervisory Board confirmed 
	
◾
Remuneration and variable compensation of 
Management Board and employees
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee updated 
the Supervisory Board on remuneration and variable 
compensation plans for both employees and the 
Management Board. The implementation of the 
Shareholders Rights Directive II and succession planning 
were regularly discussed during the meetings.
	
◾
The Internal Audit Function
The recommendations of the Internal Audit Function, 
the functioning of the Internal Audit Function and the 
progress on the Internal Audit Plan 2019 have been 
discussed and followed up during 2019.
	
◾

Opportunity Policy was an important topic during these 
discussions. Eric Drok, Olivier Bisserier and Roger Hodenius 
were reappointed as member of the Supervisory Board in 
2019. The Equal Opportunity Policy was taken into account 
regarding the reappointments of the Supervisory Board 
members. The figure in the middle column shows the terms 
of (re)appointment for all Supervisory Board members.
Independence of the Supervisory Board
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is not a former 
member of the company’s Management Board and is 
independent within the meaning of best practice provision 
2.1.8 of the Corporate Governance Code. Supervisory Board 
members Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they, as founders of Flow Traders, 
are former members of the company’s Management Board 
and represent shareholders of the company. 
When it comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, we adhere to the same principles of 
equal opportunity as set out above. As a result, our current 
Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
education, nationality, and professional backgrounds. 
Our Equal Opportunity Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
Succession planning
As announced in September 2018, Sjoerd Rietberg has taken 
the decision not to opt for reappointment as Management 
Board member and Co-CEO in 2019. In 2018 it was also 
announced to propose Dennis Dijkstra for reappointment as 
sole CEO of Flow Traders N.V. Until 8 May 2019, 
the Management Board consisted of four members. Starting 
on 8 May 2019, the Management Board consisted of three 
members. The full size and composition of the Management 
Board was discussed regularly during 2019. Our Equal 
Profile of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board Profile provides that the 
qualifications of a particular candidate and fit with the 
company’s needs shall always prevail when filling a position. 
When selecting members, the Supervisory Board aims for 
a balance in nationality, gender, age, experience, and active 
or retired backgrounds. In addition, balance in the 
experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the 
business of the company will be sought. The Supervisory 
Board strives to realize a diverse composition in the 
nomination and appointment process for vacancies, while 
taking into account the overall profile and selection criteria 
for appointments of suitable candidates to the Supervisory 
Board. As such, diversity, including gender-related, is an 
important consideration in the selection process for the (re)
appointment of Supervisory Board members. 
The Supervisory Board Profile can be found on our website: 
www.flowtraders.com.
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
The company has an Equal Opportunity Policy in place. 
In this policy we explain our objective to treat everyone 
equally during the hiring process and throughout their 
careers at Flow Traders. We are committed to being a truly 
equal opportunity employer, by recruiting, retaining and 
promoting people based on merit, and merit alone. We are 
a firm believer in the benefits of a diverse workplace and we 
do not make any concessions to quality. Our objective is to 
provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all of our 
employees, provided they perform highly. When positions 
become available, we actively encourage all candidates to 
apply and ensure that the selection and retention processes 
are truly equal for all applicants and employees. This also 
holds for our Management Board and Supervisory Board.

Remuneration & Appointment Committee
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee met six times 
in 2019, with an overall attendance rate of 92%. Other 
attendees to the meetings included the (co-)CEO and the 
Global Head of HRM & Recruitment. During the meetings

company’s culture in general, the General Remuneration

to the Supervisory Board for the remuneration practices to 
be pursued for the Management Board and staff of the 
company. It also outlined proposals for the remuneration of 
the individual members of the Management Board for 
adoption by the Supervisory Board. The size, composition 
and functioning of the Supervisory Board and Management 
Board was reviewed and findings reported to the 
Supervisory Board. Other duties included the monitoring of 
developments of the Corporate Governance Code and 
regulations in relation to remuneration policies and the 
preparation of the Remuneration Report. 
Before determining the remuneration of the Management 
Board members, the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee took note of the individual Management Board 
members’ views with regard to the amount and structure of 
their own remuneration.
Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee met three times in 
2019, with an overall attendance rate of 94%. As the core 
business of the company is discussed in this committee, 
all of the Supervisory Board members are members of the 
Trading & Technology Committee. The committee addresses 
trading topics such as, but not limited to, the general market 
conditions, the (relative) performance of the trading desks 
across the various regions Flow Traders operates in, 
External auditor
The Audit Committee and the Management Board reported 
to the Supervisory Board on EY’s functioning as the external 
auditor, the company’s relationship with the external 
auditor, on its fees, as well as on other audit and non-audit 
services it provided to the company. EY performed a review 
of the company’s interim financial statements and issued an 
unqualified review report. The Audit Committee evaluated 
the qualifications, performance and independence of EY, 
taking into account the opinions of the Management Board. 
The Audit Committee also obtained a report from the 
external auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. EY confirmed its independence 
from Flow Traders in accordance with the professional 
standards applicable to it. EY’s lead audit partner was 
present at all, but one, of the Audit Committee meetings 
held in 2019. Based on the information provided by the Audit 
Committee, the Supervisory Board nominated EY as 
external auditor at the company’s General Meeting in 2019. 
Subsequently, EY was reappointed by the General Meeting 
as external auditor for the financial year 2019.
Internal audit function 
The Internal Audit Function (IAF) executed audits that form 
part of the internal audit plan, approved by the Supervisory 
Board. Focus areas in this audit plan included the resilience 
of our trading systems, transparency and IT processes. 
The Audit Committee and the Global Head of Internal Audit 
discussed the audit results (findings, observations, 
recommendations, management feedback and follow-up). 
The Audit Committee maintains regular dialogue with the 
IAF. More information can be found in the chapter Our 
governance.
related to accounting, auditing and financial reporting, 
tax planning, tax strategy and monitoring, the company’s 
compliance with rules and regulations, the company’s Code 
of Conduct, the company’s financing strategy (including the 
interim dividend proposal) and the methods used to assess 
the effectiveness of the internal and external audit 
processes. The company’s external auditor, Ernst & Young 
Accountants LLP (EY), attended all meetings, except for one 
additional ad hoc meeting for which the minutes of that 
meeting where shared with the company’s external auditor. 
Topics discussed with the external auditor included the 
financial statements over the financial year 2018, 
recommendations on the basis of the annual report, their 
audit plan for the financial year 2019 and their interim review 
report. The Audit Committee reviewed the management 
letter and recommendations included in the auditor’s 
report, as issued by the external auditor and discussed the 
actions taken by management to address any 
recommendations and observations. The Audit Committee 
evaluates the performance of the external auditor and 
discusses this with the Supervisory Board and subsequently 
with the external auditor. In light of this, the Audit 
Committee advises the Supervisory Board about the 
reappointment of the external auditor, before the 
Supervisory Board determines its nomination for the 
appointment of the external auditor to the General Meeting. 
Given the nature of our business, the application of 
information and communication technology by the 
company, including risks relating to cyber security, 
are discussed in detail in the Trading & Technology 
Committee. Subsequently, key items in respect of these 
items are also discussed in the Audit Committee.

Financial statements and dividend
The 2019 financial statements were prepared by the 
Management Board. They were discussed both with the 
Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, in attendance 
of EY. The financial statements were audited by EY, 
who issued an unqualified auditor’s report. Reference is 
made to the auditor’s report on page 122 of the financial 
statements. The Supervisory Board approved the financial 
statements as audited by EY, including the company’s 
dividend proposal. We invite the General Meeting to:
	
◾
adopt the financial statements for 2019;
	
◾
adopt the dividend proposal as proposed by the 
Management Board and approved by the Supervisory 
Board; and
	
◾
discharge the Management Board for their 
management and the Supervisory Board for its 
supervision of the company in the financial year under 
review.
Information on the remuneration of the Management Board 
members can be found in the chapter Remuneration.
Flow Traders’ focus areas and growth strategies. 
Competitiveness, infrastructure and trading relationships, 
innovation and (cyber-) security were the main technology 
topics discussed during the year.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met three times in 2019, with each 
meeting fully attended. Invitees of the meeting were the 
Management Board members, the Head of Risk and relevant 
others. The main focus in the meetings was the 
Management Board’s risk assessment. The attendees 
discussed in detail the relevant risks the company is 
exposed to, the internal controls in place to address these 
risks, the Management Board’s views on such risks, as well 
as the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
internal risk management and control system. 
The committee has discussed the way material risks and 
uncertainties have been analyzed and discussed, the ICAAP 
and the Capital Requirement Regulation were also topics of 
discussion. More information can be found in the chapter 
Our governance.

Remuneration
Key principles and policy
Our global remuneration model reflects our key principles 
achieved through the practical implementation of the 
current General Remuneration Policy (as approved by the 
General Meeting on 19 May 2016 and published on our 
website, the ‘General Remuneration Policy’), the Dutch Act 
on Remuneration Policy of Financial Undertakings (Wet 
Beloningsbeleid Financiële Ondernemingen, the 
‘Remuneration Act’), and the related laws and regulations in 
a manner that is tailored to the size of our enterprise and the 
way it is organized, as well as the nature, scope and 
complexity of our business activities. 
The Remuneration Report in respect of the Management 
Board remuneration and the Supervisory Board 
remuneration assume to reflect the reporting requirements 
as provided by article 2:135b of the Dutch Civil Code (DCC), 
effective as per 1 December 2019 and implementing the EU 
Shareholder Rights Directive II (SRD II). We take note of the 
non-binding Guidelines on the standardised presentation of 
the remuneration report under Directive 2007/36/EC 
(“Guidelines”). Currently these Guidelines are still in draft 
form. The Supervisory Board will propose amendments to 
the Remuneration Policy at the next Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 24 April 2020. Every year, 
the implementation of the Remuneration Policy, through 
the Remuneration Report, is put forward for an advisory 
vote to the AGM (in line with article 2:135b sub 2 DCC), 
the first time at the 2020 AGM.
Key principles of the Remuneration Policy include that it is 
consistent with, and promotes, sound and effective risk 
management. It encourages alignment of the risks taken by 
employees and of the company itself, and does not 
encourage risk taking which is inconsistent with our risk 
profile. It is in line with our business strategy, objectives, 
values and interests and includes measures to avoid 
conflicts of interest. Finally, it must not lead to the risk that 
third parties are treated improperly (although we do not 
provide any investment service or ancillary service to third 
parties). 
Our global remuneration model
We are committed to attracting and retaining the best talent 
available. Our staff, including the members of the 
Management Board, receive competitive remuneration 
packages. This includes a fixed gross salary and a share from 
the singular firm-wide variable remuneration pool. 
The remuneration pool is accrued throughout the year 
based on Flow Traders’ operating result over the 
performance year reflecting company performance. 
The variable component of the total remuneration is 
dynamic, as it is a function of operating results: if there is no 
or insufficient profit or capital, there will be no variable 
remuneration. For example, if in any given year no profit is 
made, none of our employees will receive any variable 
remuneration. If the company incurs a loss, deferred 
variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited entirely. 
This policy also applies to members of the Management 
Board. 
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the beginning of 
each calendar year clear objectives are set depending on an 
employee’s role, which are in line with our company 
objectives for the year and our corporate key competencies: 
drive, ownership and teamwork. Performance is reviewed 
four times a year. 
Individual variable remuneration payable from the collective 
variable compensation pool is dependent on company and 
business unit performance, individual performance and the 
individual’s contribution to the long-term success of the 
company as a whole, discouraging a culture of ‘star’ behavior 
and fostering collaboration and teamwork. Flow Traders 
does not base variable remuneration directly on financial 
results achieved individually. The Supervisory Board 
approves the awarding of variable remuneration.
If awarded, for most recipients variable remuneration is paid 
in cash in two or three annual instalments. The deferred 
variable component acts as a first loss tranche to 
compensate for any operating loss in the subsequent year, 
acting as a buffer before such loss would impact 
shareholder equity. This serves as an important incentive for 
risk-aware behavior, keeping in mind the long-term 
objectives of the company and alignment with our risk 
appetite. We deem the deferral period sufficient given the 
company’s risk profile and horizon. Variable remuneration 
components may become subject to reduction or claw back 
if it is determined that the relevant employee or member of 
the Management Board did not meet adequate norms of 
competence and appropriate behavior or was responsible 
for behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of the 
company’s position, in accordance with applicable law.

reward loyalty we introduced the Flow Cash Incentive Plan 
(FCIP) in 2017 and promote the Flow Loyalty Incentive Plan 
(FLIP). Under the FCIP employees are offered the 
opportunity to buy company shares in the first open period 
of the year and receive an attractive annual cash incentive 
over a five-year period for as long as the shares are held by 
the participant. The right to the cash incentive is forfeited if 
the participant transfers his or her shares out of the FCIP or 
when the employment of the participant with Flow Traders 
ends. With the FLIP program, company shares are awarded 
to employees marking their two-year anniversary with the 
company. Shares awarded under the FLIP are subject to 
a lock-up period and remain with the employee regardless 
of the termination of his or her employment with Flow 
Traders. The cash incentive under the FCIP, as well as the 
shares awarded under the FLIP, are fully paid out from the 
variable compensation pool. The FCIP and the FLIP terms 
and conditions are subject to review by the Management 
Board annually. Both plans were approved by the 
Supervisory Board in 2017. As a part of these plans, shares 
have been and will be bought in the market. 
We do not award guaranteed variable remuneration to 
employees unless the guaranteed variable component is 
awarded in relation to hiring new staff, limited to the first 
year of employment, and only if we have a sound and strong 
capital base. We do not award severance payments if there 
is a serious imputable act or negligence by the employee in 
the fulfilment of his or her function or where an employee 
resigns voluntarily (unless this is the consequence of 
a serious imputable act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar 
handelen of nalaten) by the company). The company did not 
grant its employees any personal loans, guarantees or the 
like as part of their compensation package in 2019. 
No employee loans, guarantees or the like were outstanding 
on 31 December 2019. We do not provide any other ancillary 
benefits for any employee. We have not reserved or accrued 
any amounts to cover pension claims or retirement claims.
One of our core values is ownership, and we mean it both in 
terms of mindset and behavior as well as literally. We believe 
that being a shareholder aligns the interests of the company 
with those of our employees. To promote shareholding and 
The Management Board is not eligible to participate in either 
of these plans. 
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. At our 
headquarters in Amsterdam, we partner with a pension 
provider, giving employees the freedom of choice to select 
the option that best suits their individual needs while 
incentivizing participation in the company-sponsored 
program. In our other offices we offer schemes that are 
driven by country-specific practices and regulations. 
Management Board Remuneration
Introduction
The remuneration of, and other agreements with, 
the members of the Management Board are required to be 
determined by the Supervisory Board with due observance 
of the General Remuneration Policy and applicable laws and 
regulations. The Supervisory Board has assessed the 
remuneration of our Management Board members based on 
their performance in 2019.
The remuneration of our Management Board members 
consists of a relatively modest fixed base salary and 
a variable, partially deferred, remuneration in cash. 
The variable pay element depends on company 
performance, individual performance, and how 
a Management Board member contributed to the long-term 
success of the company as a whole In order to control the 
level of fixed costs within Flow Traders, provide effective 
risk mitigating incentives and provide significant rewards for 
employees and members of the Management Board only if 
the firm is actually profitable, the ratio between fixed and 
variable pay is skewed towards variable pay. Also, ‘clawback’

Board over 2019. No shares or other financial instruments

financial viability of the company.

Incentives from previous share plans
Prior to their appointment into the Management Board, 
Chief Trading Officer Folkert Joling and Chief Technology 
Officer Thomas Wolff had participated in the Flow Traders 
Cash Incentive Plan 2017 (FCIP 2017). Under the FCIP plan 
rules they were offered the opportunity to buy Company 
shares and receive an annual cash incentive over a five year 
period. The right to these incentives would have been 
forfeited due to ceasing to be an employee and becoming 
a member of the Management Board in April 2018. However, 
special permission has been granted to both Management 
Board members to remain entitled to the incentive rights 
under the FCIP plan rules in respect of the shares bought 
under the FCIP at the time they were an employee of Flow 
Traders rather than a member of the Management Board. 
As a result, they have both received €8,000 annual cash 
incentive.
Variable remuneration
Based on actual performance over 2019, all members of the 
Management Board combined received an aggregate 
variable compensation of €1,800,000. The variable 
remuneration awards to the members of the Management 
Board are determined on the basis of the following 
principles:
	
◾
First, the maximum variable remuneration is set by the 
Supervisory Board within the limits of the firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool for a given year. As set out 
above, the pool is approximately 35 percent of the 
operating result and is directly contingent upon a 
positive operating result. Financial performance 
indicators are therefore integrated into this 
self-correcting mechanism: the variable remuneration 
of the members of the Management Board will be a 
direct reflection of actual realized company 
performance.

◾
Second, within those limits, the variable remuneration is 
determined annually on the basis of a management-
assessment performance framework. This framework 
translates Flow Traders’ strategic business objectives 
into predetermined, assessable performance criteria 
that can be influenced by the Management Board’s 
performance within a Balanced Performance 
Scorecard. This Scorecard is composed of four 
non-financial focus areas, which aim to robustly assess 
the Management Board member’s performance within 
Flow Traders’ operating environment and stakeholder 
interests. These four areas comprise Growth, External 
Relationships, Internal Processes / Excellence, 
and People and Culture. 
	
◾
Third, each year - within the Balanced Performance 
Scorecard framework - the Supervisory Board sets 
targets for the individual Management Board members 
for specific performance elements. These are assessed 
annually, in order to determine management’s 
performance and variable remuneration.
	
◾
Fourth, during the year, the Supervisory Board discusses 
performance with the individual Management Board 
members in mid-year and year-end assessment 
meetings. The main messages and the year-end 
assessment of KPI’s for the individual Management 
Board members are included in their year-end letter 
which also communicates their variable remuneration 
for the year.

The above principles for determining variable remuneration 
were applied in the following manner in 2019. 
1.	
Setting the maximum variable remuneration within 
the limits of the firm-wide variable remuneration 
pool
As a result of lower operating results, the firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool for 2019 was considerably lower than in 
2018 (€24.6 million in 2019 vs €87.6 million in 2018). 
The available pool is one the key drivers of variable 
remuneration and compared to last year, it has meant 
significantly reduced levels of Management Board variable 
remuneration.
2.	 Balanced Performance Scorecard

2019 Balanced Performance Scorecard (Growth, External 
Relationships, Internal Process Excellence and People &

metric: the accrued firm-wide variable remuneration pool 
which itself depends on the operating result for the given 
financial year.
Because of the nature of our business activities and the fast 
paced industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable remuneration 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year while 
performing a single, one-off, assessment at the end of the 
year as set out in the best practice provisions of the 
Corporate Governance Code. Half-yearly discussions take 
place between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee for this purpose. 
Targets are set for each individual Management Board 
member and the Management Board as a whole. Significant 
underperformance or overperformance in respect of these 
targets can result in reductions or increases of the profit 
share that is awarded to a Management Board member. 
As mentioned, compensation of the members of the 
Management Board is limited to a relatively modest fixed 
remuneration component and a variable component 
dependent on operating result being realized. They did not 
receive share-based remuneration or other elaborate 
incentive schemes. This limits the number of scenarios to be 
meaningfully assessed as prescribed by the best practice 
provisions.
Relation between company performance and 
Management Board Remuneration
The remuneration of our Management Board members is 
volatile and highly correlated with the company results. 
This is clearly illustrated in the table below which shows the 
Corporate Governance Code provide that the remuneration 
of the members of the Management Board may be reduced 
or they may be obliged to repay (part of) their variable 
remuneration to the company if certain circumstances 
apply.
Pursuant to the applicable laws and regulations, any variable 
remuneration component conditionally awarded to 
a member of the Management Board in a previous financial 
year which would, in the opinion of the Supervisory Board, 
produce an unfair result due to extraordinary circumstances 
during the period in which the predetermined performance 
criteria have been or should have been applied, 
the Supervisory Board will have the power to adjust the 
value downwards or upwards. In addition, the Supervisory 
Board will have the authority under applicable Dutch law, 
including the Remuneration Act, to recover any variable 
remuneration awarded from a member of the Management 
Board on the basis of incorrect financial or other data (claw 
back). In addition, variable remuneration components may 
become subject to claw back and malus pursuant to the 
Remuneration Act and related regulations.
Pursuant to Dutch law, the Supervisory Board may 
furthermore adjust the variable remuneration (to the extent 
that it is subject to reaching certain targets and the 
occurrence of certain events) to an appropriate level if 
payment of the variable remuneration were to be 
unacceptable according to requirements of reasonableness 
and fairness. 
Scenario analyses carried out in respect of variable 
remuneration
The variable remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board is contingent upon a future, unknown, 
Culture). These elements represent the company wide 
objectives for which the performance of the Management 
Board as a team was assessed. 
3.	 Individual targets
Within the Balanced Performance Scorecard framework, 
also individual targets were set for the Management Board 
members, tailored to their specific role and responsibilities. 
These included amongst others financial targets on Net 
Trading Income and product diversification, non-financial 
but quantifiable targets on operational performance and 
reaching milestones in further strengthening the control 
framework.
 
4.	 Assessing performance
Overall, Flow Traders’ financial performance reflected the 
subdued market circumstances. However, the Management 
Board improved efficiency and maintained a tight control on 
execution and process management throughout the 
company. Lastly, the Management Board invested in people 
and technology as part of executing Flow Traders’ growth 
strategy. 
Adjustments to variable remuneration
Variable remuneration to members of the Management 
Board is paid in cash in multiple annual instalments and may 
be reduced or clawed back under circumstances described 
in the Remuneration Act. As explained in the section above 
on our global remuneration model, the deferred variable 
component acts as a first loss tranche to compensate any 
operating loss in the subsequent year, before such loss 
would impact shareholder equity. If the company incurs 
a loss, deferred variable remuneration is reduced or 
forfeited entirely. In addition to the reduction and claw back 
provisions of the Remuneration Act, Dutch law and the

development of the company performance and the average 
(full-time) remuneration of executives and employees since 
Flow Traders’ IPO in 2015. The table demonstrates that when 
the Net Trading Income and EBITDA go down, the absolute 
Management Board remuneration goes down. Similarly, 
when indicators for company performance go up, 
the Management Board remuneration goes up (provided of 
course that the individual Management Board member has 
been performing well).

holding or transacting in the company’s securities. Members 
of the Supervisory Board may not accept personal loans or 
guarantees from the company, other than in the normal 
course of business and subject to the prior approval of the 
Supervisory Board. During 2019, the company granted no 
personal loans, guarantees or the like to the members of 
the Supervisory Board. No personal loans, guarantees or the 
like to Supervisory Board members were outstanding on 
31 December 2019.
Fixed gross compensation
The table below shows the total fixed compensation 
awarded to the individual members of the Supervisory 
Board. There are no separate committee fees paid.
Supervisory Board Remuneration
The General Meeting determines the remuneration of the 
members of the Supervisory Board following a proposal by 
the Supervisory Board. The remuneration of the members of 
the Supervisory Board consists of a fixed base salary and 
cannot be dependent upon the company’s results. 
None of the members of the Supervisory Board may receive 
shares, options for shares or similar rights to acquire shares 
as part of his or her remuneration. None of the members of 
the Supervisory Board may hold shares, options for shares or 
similar securities other than as a long-term investment. 
The members of the Supervisory Board may also not hold 
such securities, other than in accordance with the rules on 
Our reference market would be defined as other proprietary 
trading firms including but not limited to for example IMC 
and Optiver. However, most of these firms do not publicly 
disclose remuneration of their executives. Therefore, due to 
limited data availability, no meaningful market comparison 
can actually be performed. 
The 2019 pay ratio (CEO total pay vs average total employee 
pay) is 4.65 compared to 10.8 in 2018. 
No shares, pensions, loans and other benefits
In 2019 the members of the Management Board did not 
receive any shares and no personal loans, guarantees or the 
like were granted by the company to the members of the 
Management Board as part of their compensation package. 
No loans, guarantees or similar instruments to the members 
of the Management Board were outstanding on 
31 December 2019. We have not reserved nor accrued any 
amounts to cover pension claims or retirement claims. 
We do not provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
member of the Management Board.
Limited severance payments
We do not award severance payments to members of the 
Management Board that exceed 100 percent of their annual 
fixed remuneration, and do not award severance payments 
if there is a serious imputable act or negligence by the 
employee in the fulfilment of their functions, where they 
resign voluntarily (unless this is the consequence of a serious 
imputable act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar handelen of 
nalaten) or failure by the company), and we do not intend to 
award such payments in the future. In addition, relevant 
limitations apply under the Remuneration Act.

Remuneration regulations are subject to change. Currently, 
the European Commission, European Parliament and 
European member states are negotiating implementing 
regulations pertaining to new prudential requirement 
including remuneration requirements for investment firms 
(IFR/IFD) which may affect our Dutch trading entity and our 
Group. We expect more certainty about the outcome during 
the course of 2020 and early 2021. We continuously monitor 
such changes but currently cannot assess in full what the 
exact implementation or impact of such changes will be. 
Changes may have a significant impact on the General 
Remuneration Policy, our global remuneration model and 
other remuneration practices of the company and its group 
companies. It may also impact our ability to attract or retain 
talent given the global and highly competitive nature of our 
industry.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1.	
Reporting entity
Flow Traders N.V. (referred to as the ‘Company’) is a public limited liability company (naamloze 
vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its seat (statutaire 
zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, having its registered office at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 
1018 LL Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Trade Register of the Chamber of 
Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, afdeling Handelsregister) under number 34294936.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is a leading global technology-enabled liquidity provider 
that specializes in exchange traded products (ETPs). 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the annual period ended 31 December 
2019 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders N.V., its subsidiaries and associates. 
The annual financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company’s Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board on 27 February 2020 subject to adoption by the General 
Meeting of shareholders.
2.	 Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption.
3.	 Basis of preparation 
a)	
Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (‘IFRS-EU’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS-EU provides several options in 
accounting principles. The Group’s accounting principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding 
the options available are set out in the section ‘Significant accounting policies’ below.
b)	
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except 
for the following items and unless otherwise indicated:
	
◾
financial assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with changes 
recognized in profit or loss; 
	
◾
investments fair value through OCI assets are measured at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses which are 
recognized in profit or loss.
c)	
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the Group’s 
functional currency. All financial information presented in euros has been rounded to the 
nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to form opinions and make 
estimates and assumptions that influence the reported value of assets and liabilities and of 
income and expenditure. The actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are constantly assessed. Revisions of estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. For more details, we refer you to 
the chapter on Fair values of financial instruments.
d)	
Principles for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows
The consolidated statement of cash flows is based on the indirect method.
The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, including trading activities, investment 
activities and financing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of 
acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments other than in the course 
of operations, as well as acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property and 
equipment.

The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, 
the carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part 
thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair 
value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any gain or loss 
resulting from the fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration is recognized in profit 
or loss.
f)	
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of the Group at 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the foreign currency 
difference recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising on the translation of investments fair 
value through OCI are recognized in other comprehensive income unless the instrument is 
impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at 
fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the 
4.	 Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
e)	
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group entities.
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from 
intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated 
against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee if it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date when control ceases. 
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.
Investments in associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or 
joint control, over its financial and operating activities. Control or significant influence follows 
from facts and circumstances, but there is a rebuttable presumption that significant influence 
when the Group holds between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting power of another 
entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized 
initially at cost.

◾

The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan

◾

Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group acquires or incurs 
principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of 
a portfolio that is managed together for short-term profit.
Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value in 
the statement of financial position, with transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. 
All changes in fair value are recognized as part of net trading income in profit or loss. 
Trading assets and liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition.
Trading receivables and payables
Such assets are recognized initially at fair value with any directly attributable transaction costs 
recognized in profit or loss. These items are valued at fair value through profit or loss on initial 
recognition and changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss as they arise. 
Investments fair value through OCI
Investments fair value through OCI are non-derivative financial assets. Investments fair value 
through OCI are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in other 
comprehensive income as part of the change in fair value at the next remeasurement and they 
are never reclassified into profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other 
than foreign currency differences on fair value through OCI debt instruments, are recognized in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based 
on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. 
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euros at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in 
the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of equity. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, 
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclas-
sified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
g)	
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three 
months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
h)	
Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are originated. 
All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) 
are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or 
issue.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the 
transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group 
determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the 
fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or 
liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, 
then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, 
that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market 
data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on theoretical prices whereby the price 
differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those theoretical prices can differ 
from quoted market prices. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department monitors whether all 
differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the Group on the basis 
of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price 
that would be received to sell a net long position or paid to transfer a net short position for 
a particular risk exposure. Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the 
reporting period during which the change has occurred.
i)	
Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. 
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
investment is derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit 
or loss.
Other financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any directly  
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes 
a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated 
with its capital contributions to the United States subsidiaries. Gains or losses on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI while any gains 
or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. 
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded 
in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of offset is agreed 
between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS-EU, 
for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading 
activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at 
that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market 
for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognized and in subsequent years measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of equity-accounted investees is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-
accounted investee as a whole.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
k)	
Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and other debt 
financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee 
contracts, in this section all referred to as ‘financial instruments’, is based on the credit losses 
expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless 
there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, 
the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). 
Impairment losses on investments fair value through OCI are recognized in other compre-
hensive income and do not reduce the carrying value of the investment.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the 
recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
For other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, 
the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is 
based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to 
the debtors and the economic environment. 
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a financial asset to be in default when 
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as the difference 
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognized in 
profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over 
the estimated useful lives of each component. 
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant items of 
property and equipment are as follows:
	
◾
hardware: 5 years;
	
◾
office fixtures: 5 years;
	
◾
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date 
and adjusted if appropriate. 
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., 
the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, 
less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeas-
urement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease 
liabilities recognized less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease 
term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Right-of-use assets are recorded in 
property and equipment and intangible assets on the statement of financial position.
j)	
Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the estimated 
useful lives of each component. The estimated useful life of significant intangible assets is 5 
years.

l)	
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash variable 
compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
m)	 Share based payments
Awards of shares granted to certain employees are equity-settled. The cost of these equity-
settled transactions is determined by the fair value of the shares at the date when the grant is 
made and is recognized in employee expenses, together with a corresponding increase in equity 
(retained earnings), over the period in which the service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting 
period). The awards vest in tranches on various dates over a total period of three to five years. 
Vesting is conditional upon the employee being actively employed by the Group on the vesting 
date. If the employee is terminated or resigns, any unvested tranches of the award will be 
forfeited. 
n)	
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognized as finance cost. 
o)	
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities on the 
statement of financial position measured at the present value of lease payments to be made 
over the lease term. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the 
incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. After the commencement date, 
the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for 
the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if 
there is a change in the lease term.
internal or external information indicated that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding 
contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the 
Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the 
contractual cash flows.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is 
recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed 
reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU 
(group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no 
impairment loss had been recognized.

In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the 
impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. 
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based 
on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and management 
judgement. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause the Group to 
change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities or the collectability of 
tax assets. Such changes will impact tax expense in the period that such a change in estimate is 
made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or 
the tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
r)	
Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognized at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the 
carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in the share premium.
s)	
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental 
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs 
and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., 
those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do 
not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
p)	
Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial expenses 
related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and are therefore 
directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading income.
q)	
Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized 
in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items recognized 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to 
tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any 
withholding tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
	
◾
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss; 
	
◾
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in the foreseeable future; and
	
◾
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.

Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sale will be withdrawn. Management must be 
committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year 
from the date of the classification.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the 
statement of financial position.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either 
has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and is part of a single coordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
5.	 Operating segments
The Group operates in the following regions via its subsidiaries and branches in Europe (the 
Netherlands, United Kingdom, Romania), the Americas (the United States of America) and Asia 
(Singapore and Hong Kong).
The Group’s trading assets and liabilities attributable to each segment are reported to 
management on the basis of net liquidity. Consequently, the reported total assets in each 
segment are net of the segment’s financial liabilities held for trading and trading payables. 
The Group’s capital expenditures include additions to property, equipment and intangible 
assets as set out in notes 20 and 21.

6.	 New standards and interpretations
In these financial statements IFRS 16 has been applied for the first time. This new standard has 
limited impact on the financials and is disclosed in more detail below. All other accounting 
policies are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at 
and for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2019, but do not have 
an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains 
a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of 
Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The standard sets out the principles for the 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to 
account for most leases under a single on-balance sheet model.
The Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date 
of initial application of 1 January 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospec-
tively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of 
initial application. 
 
Nature of the effect of adoption of IFRS 16 
Leases previously classified as finance leases
The Group did not change the initial carrying amounts of recognised assets and liabilities at the 
date of initial application for leases previously classified as finance leases (i.e., the right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities equal the lease assets and liabilities recognised under IAS 17). 
The requirements of IFRS 16 were applied to these leases from 1 January 2019. 
Leases previously accounted for as operating leases
The Group recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases previously 
classified as operating leases, except for short-term leases. The right-of-use assets recognized 
were equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted by the amount of any lease incentives relating such 
leases recognized in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial

The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the 
price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly 
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date.
The Group uses widely recognized valuation techniques and models (including net present 
value models and comparisons with similar instruments for which market observable prices 
exist) for determining the fair value of common, simple financial instruments that use only 
observable market data and require little management judgement and estimation. Observable 
prices or model inputs (including risk-free and benchmark interest rates and credit spreads 
used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, 
equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and correlations) are usually 
available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives and 
simple over-the-counter derivatives. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs 
reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and thus reduces the uncertainty 
associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable market prices and inputs 
varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific 
events and general conditions in the financial markets.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in determining appropriate portfolio-level 
adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask 
spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. Similarly, 
when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, it takes into account any existing 
arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the 
counterparty).
Valuation framework
The Group has a control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. 
This framework includes a Risk and Mid-Office department which is independent of the Trading 
department and reports directly to the Management Board. The Risk and Mid-Office 
department has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading and all 
significant fair value measurements. The daily reconciliation of the positions and prices 
between the prime brokers and the Trading department is most important.
application. Lease liabilities were recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease 
payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. 
Based on the foregoing, as at 1 January 2019:
	
◾
Right-of-use assets of €15,546 were recognised and presented in property and equipment 
in the statement of financial position. This includes lease incentives of €272 previously 
recognised under other liabilities. Additional lease liabilities of €15,818 were recognized 
and presented in lease liabilities in the statement of financial position.
	
◾
In addition, lease liabilities of €4,549 related to finance leases have been reclassified to 
lease liabilities which were previously recognised under other liabilities. Leased hardware 
and software of € 3,761 have been reclassified to right-of-use assets.
	
◾
These adjustments had no effect on retained earnings.
For more information, refer to notes 19, 20 and 23 for further disclosures on leases. 
7.	 Fair values of financial instruments
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the 
following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in 
determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
Valuation models 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, depending on the 
inputs used for making the measurements.
	
◾
Level 1: inputs that are quoted, unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical 
instruments;
	
◾
Level 2: inputs, other than within Level 1, that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valuated using: 
quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical 
or similar instruments in markets that are considered inactive; or other valuation 
techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable market data; 
	
◾
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the 
valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a significant effect on the 
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valuated based on 
quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or 
assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.

underlying the Group’s positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on 
which the financial asset or liability is traded closes. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office 
department checks the theoretical price independently. As part of Its review, It monitors 
whether all price adjustments can be substantiated with market inputs. Consequently, 
such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to determine fair 
value. 
b)	
Investments fair value through OCI
The fair value of Investments fair value through OCI is determined by reference to their quoted 
closing bid price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique 
and are classified as Level 2.
c)	
Other receivables 
The carrying value of other receivables with a maturity of less than one year is assumed to 
approximate their fair values.

The prime brokers of the Group provide electronic position statements on a daily basis, which 
are uploaded automatically into the Group’s databases. The Group and its prime brokers agreed 
when files will be available and methods for transmission and communication. All data is 
normalized by the Group so it can be used in multiple internal systems. The information is 
mainly used for daily independent reconciliation of positions and prices, resulting in profit and 
loss accounts.
The following reconciliations are executed on a daily basis:
	
◾
reconciliation of the positions - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles the 
positions of the Trading department with information provided by the prime brokers. 
All differences are reconciled and agreed by the Trading department of the Group and the 
prime brokers;
	
◾
reconciliation of prices - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles prices as provided 
by the Trading Department with those of the prime brokers and/or data from external data 
vendors. All differences are reconciled and the Risk and Mid-Office department makes 
sure that any required follow up action is taken, either by the prime broker or the Trading 
department. Therefore, all prices are checked with independent sources.
Results of these reconciliation processes are communicated and agreed with Heads of Trading, 
the Risk and Mid-Office department and the Management Board on a daily basis.
a)	
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The Group mainly trades on regulated and active markets. The financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading are carried at fair value, based whenever possible on quoted market prices, 
as published by exchanges, market data vendors and prime brokers. 
The valuation of trading positions, both the long and the short positions, is determined by 
reference to last traded prices from similar instruments from the exchanges at the reporting 
date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are carried at fair 
value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted market prices. 
The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused by the fact that the Group 
continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities based on all available information. 
This includes prices for identical and near-identical positions, as well as the prices for securities

Hedge of net investments in foreign operations  
Included in financial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2019 was a borrowing of 
USD115,000,000 which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United 
States subsidiaries, which have their functional currencies in USD. This borrowing is being used 
to hedge the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or 
losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to OCI to offset any gains or losses 
on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the 
net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the USD 
borrowing. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging 
instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise 
when the amount of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the amount 
of the borrowing.

9.	 Net trading income
Gross trading income comprises the realized and unrealized income on financial instruments. 
Fees related to the trading activities consist of exchange fees, clearing fees and other trading 
related fees. Net financial expenses related to the trading activities mainly relate to interest 
expense on the credit facilities with the prime brokers calculated on the drawn amount during 
the year.

The wages and salaries increased in line with the FTE growth from 436 as per 31 December 2018 
to 513 as per 31 December 2019. Overall employee expenses decreased by 37% due to a lower 
amount of variable compensation paid to employees compared to the prior year. The amount 
of variable compensation payable is based on the operational profit of the company. 
The Group awarded shares to senior employees as part of their sign-on package during 2019. 
For this reason the share awards had an opening balance of zero. Included in variable compen-
sation are equity-settled expenses arising from shares awarded to senior employees of €238 
thousand (2018: nil). Note that foreign currency exchange differences occur between expenses 
recognized and movements in equity due to changes in exchange rates. The fair value of the 
awards was estimated on the date of grant based on a weighted average share price of €24.02. 
At 31 December 2019, awards issued were outstanding as follows:

Borrowings
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to facilitate the trading 
activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of financial instruments). The drawn 
amounts on these facilities continuously fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given 
moment.
The Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities with ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V. 
(AACB), totaling € 2,450 million. In addition, the Group entered into interest-bearing credit 
facilities for portfolio margin financing with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), NatWest 
Markets, Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank and Sova Capital. These facilities 
can be modified or terminated at any time. The facilities are exclusively for the financing of 
positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary course of the trading activities 
using the various prime brokers. 
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin requirements 
(representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is variable and calculated on a daily 
basis depending on portfolio size and composition) in cash or securities as security for our 
positions held with the relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities the Group is required to comply with 
a net liquidation balance that exceeds the haircut calculated by the prime broker. Both the net 
liquidation balance and haircut are variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on 
portfolio size and composition. The main covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to-
loan size (variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio composition). 
In addition, they require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%, calculated by 
shareholders equity divided by credit limit.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with financial 
statements and other information, including information on our trading activities and trading 
counterparties, and permission to inspect our books and records. Furthermore, they require us 
to maintain all relevant authorizations and memberships required in order to conduct our 
business, and comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and place restrictions on 
mergers and disposition of our assets outside the ordinary course of our business.
Goodwill
In December 2010 the Group obtained control of TradeSense Solutions B.V. and its subsidiary 
Flow Traders Technologies SRL (formerly TradeSense Solutions SRL), a software development 
company with special focus on trading in electronic markets. The goodwill amounted to € 502 
thousand. 
There were no additions or impairments to the goodwill in 2019 and 2018.

Overview
The Group is exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
	
◾
credit risk;
	
◾
market risk;
	
◾
liquidity risk.
Cash incentive provided to employees
As explained on page 71 of the Remuneration Report, our employees have the possibility to 
participate in an employee incentive plan and are eligible to a cash incentive depending on their 
share position in the company. One of the conditions for this cash incentive is that the 
employee needs to be employed at the company at time of the payment of the cash incentive. 
Payments will be made in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth year of the plan. Based on 
IAS 19, costs related to the cash incentive may not be recognized until the employee fulfills the 
service obligation. Therefore these costs will be recognized in the future years in the profit and 
loss.

The Group manages credit risk through its Risk and Mid-Office department that provide 
specific guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit risk. 
Policies include amongst others:
	
◾
limits for individual product types;
	
◾
limits per counterparty;
	
◾
limits on the duration of the exposure;
	
◾
limits for settlement types;
	
◾
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty exposures are 
monitored on an intra-day basis. 
During 2019, the Group observed no significant concentration of credit risks towards single 
counterparties and geographically there was no concentration of credit risk. 
Based on the Group’s counterparty credit risk monitoring, the Group believes that no 
impairment is necessary in respect of trading and other receivables.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial liabilities that:
	
◾
are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
	
◾
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that 
covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase 
agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. Similar financial instruments 
include derivatives, sales and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase 
agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, 
such as loans and deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the 
statement of financial position. This is because they create a right to offset recognized 
amounts for the parties to the agreement that is enforceable only following an event of 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the 
Group’s management of capital.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the settlement of 
off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. These amounts 
significantly exceed expected loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes 
into account the likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of 
counterparty default is deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
and the central counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was 
as follows:

10,054
Trading receivables
3,196,439
3,039,875
Other receivables

Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are guaranteed by the 
central counterparty or clearing house related to that exchange. Members of these clearing 
houses are required to deposit substantial amounts of cash, bonds or equities as collateral for 
any failure to settlement of trading. While still a limited part of our business, there is an 
inherent risk related to transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges as they are generally 
unregulated. This risk is mitigated by strict onboarding procedures and limiting the value traded 
on exchange to minimize the maximum risk.

default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties or following other 
predetermined events. In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on 
a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can receive and grant 
collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in respect of the following transactions:
	
◾
derivatives;
	
◾
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
	
◾
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities as set 
out in Notes 15 and 22 in respect of derivatives (including swaps). Such collateral is subject to 
standard industry terms including, where appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. 
This means that securities received/granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the 
term of the transaction, but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also 
give each party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure to 
post collateral.

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the euro, but also 
United States dollars and Singapore dollars. 
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well as net results 
of these foreign operations during the year.
The Group manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency. 
The Group does use financial instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net 
investments in foreign operations or net results of foreign operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial instruments. The Group 
is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches of arranged interest rates of assets 
and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These 
limits ensure that interest rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and 
hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. 
All financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair value on 
the balance sheet. All positions carried on the balance sheet are short term and listed on 
exchanges and therefore liquid and tradable. 
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility available to 
facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the balance sheet. In order to match the 
liquidity and short holding period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate 
payable, which is floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact 
that the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short positions and 
in the EFP of the future. 
Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial instrument 
fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, 
volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and equity prices. The Risk and 
Mid-Office department monitors market risk exposure on a continuous basis (including 
intra-day). Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated risk for the Group, limit 
breaches, if any, will trigger action from the Risk and Mid-Office department in order to reduce 
the risk. 
In addition to the Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily. The applicable haircut and margins are computed by the Group’s prime 
brokers. The Risk and Mid-Office department computes the haircut using internal models 
enabling intra-day monitoring. Limits are set on both capital- and credit usage.
Long and short trading positions include securities and derivatives such as: shares, American 
depositary receipts (ADRs), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRAs), 
exchange-traded products (ETP) and cryptocurrencies. All traded financial instruments are 
liquid instruments. Therefore, the portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame 
and with limited costs.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize the risk for market movements and 
does not engage in long and/or short only positions. The direction of market movements, i.e. 
what the Group considers directional market risk, is not relevant for the Group because of this 
long/short trading strategy. Because of the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed. 
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and 
settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are captured in the risk 
and margin requirements which the Group is required to post at its prime brokers and clearing 
firms. The consolidated margin and haircut requirements over 2019 is shown in the Capital 
management paragraph. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk close to zero 
remains as a result of inefficiencies in the models of the prime brokers.

Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as the Group’s 
investments in investments fair value through OCI securities. In addition, for its option 
positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk factor. Other 
factors to consider are time and dividend expectations. 
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual positions per 
product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the size of the exposure, concen-
trations, pricing and valuation parameters and natural hedging between these long and short 
positions.
As the Group is active in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in 
underlying values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.  
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and margins are computed 
by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis measures all positions, individual and 
correlated, and reflects the different risk components. The third party haircut calculation 
confirms the internal assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is 
exposed to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under Market risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime brokers, 
is monitored on a daily basis.

Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the prime brokers 
through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well as cash generated from our 
operating activities. As of 31 December 2019, the Group held €5.7 million in cash and cash 
equivalents compared to € 10.1 million as of 31 December 2018. These balances are maintained 
primarily to support operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient 
short-term access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.
The Group maintains a highly liquid balance sheet, with a large portion of its total assets 
consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable securities and short-term trading receivables 
(arising from securities transactions). 
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intra-day basis and maintains significant 
portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to facilitate trading. These facilities 
are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as well as all financial assets in accounts held at the

respective prime brokers. The Group has no outstanding borrowings other than the portfolio 
financing facilities with prime brokers.
Capital management

development of the business. The Management Board monitors the return on its capital as well 
as the level of dividends to its shareholders.

All amounts in thousands of euros, unless stated otherwise.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the determination  
of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and 
determination of the result for its parent Company financial statements, the Group applies the 
option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the 
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result 
(hereinafter referred to as principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent company 
financial statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS-EU financial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has significant influence, 
are measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated statements chapter 1 to 4 for 
a description of the Group’s IFRS-EU principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Group’s share in the results of these 
participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the transfer of assets and liabilities 
between (i) the Group and its participating interests on (ii) between participating interests 
themselves, are not recognized.

Management Board may, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, make one or more 
interim distributions to the holders of shares. The Management Board may decide, with the 
approval of the Supervisory Board, that a distribution on shares shall not take place as a 
cash payment but as a payment in shares, or decide that holders of shares shall have the 
option to receive a distribution as a cash payment and/or as a payment in shares, out of the

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsi-
bilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht account-
antsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankeli-
jkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence 
regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- 
en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.  
Our audit approach
Our understanding of the business
Flow Traders N.V. is a global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial 
products such as Exchange Traded Products. The group is structured in components and we 
tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific attention in our audit to 
a number of areas driven by the nature of the group and our risk assessment. 
We start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud, non-compliance with laws 
and regulations or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks, and to 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepre-
sentations, or the override of internal control.

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2019 123
In our risk assessment we considered the potential impact of management override of controls 
within the pricing. 
 
We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested 
the operating effectiveness, of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks. In addition, 
we performed procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in 
particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as 
disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and 
address high-risk journal entries.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We considered the outcome of our 
other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or 
non-compliance. If so, we reevaluate our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on 
our audit procedures.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations
We assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that 
could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our 
general industry experience, through discussions with the management board, reading minutes, 
inspection of internal audit and compliance (incidents) reports, and performing substantive 
tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.
We also inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and 
remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally 
we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations have been disclosed to us. 
Going concern
In order to identify and assess the risks of going concern and to conclude on the appropri-
ateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, we consider based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Materiality
Materiality
€ 3,3 million (2018: € 5 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of pre-tax income (rounded)
Explanation
We applied pre-tax income as this benchmark is an 
important metric for the users of the financial statements 
of Flow Traders N.V.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our 
opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of € 163 thousand, which 
are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and cannot be 
expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to 
obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in fines, litigation or other consequences 
for the company that may have a material effect on the financial statements.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
In order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements 
due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the 
entity’s internal control relevant to the audit and in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management 
override of internal control. We do not audit internal control per se for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors 
(including internal audit, legal, compliance and Risk and Middle Office) and the supervisory 
board. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with 
respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption.

Teaming, use of specialists 
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the 
appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in the 
liquidity providing industry. We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, tax positions and 
-expense and cryptocurrencies and have made use of our own experts in the areas of 
valuations of trading positions and actuaries.
General audit procedures
Our audit further included among others:
	
◾
Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
	
◾
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
	
◾
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures
	
◾
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signif-
icance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to 
the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters 
discussed. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.
Following the increasing activity of Flow Traders N.V. in cryptocurrencies, a new key audit 
matter “Digital assets transactions and balances” has been defined.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as 
a going concern.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders N.V. Amsterdam is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of 
this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Flow Traders N.V. 
As we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, 
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and 
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities 
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information 
or specific items.
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities, being Flow Traders B.V. and Flow 
Traders U.S. LLC based on the relative financial size of these components.
We have: 
	
◾
Performed audit procedures ourselves for the component entity Flow Traders B.V.
	
◾
Used the work of other non-EY auditors for auditing the component entity Flow Traders 
U.S. LLC
	
◾
Performed specific audit procedures at other component entities
By performing the procedures mentioned above at component level, together with additional 
procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit 
evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated 
financial statements.

Our audit approach
Key observations 
Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for trading  
(note 7 of the financial statements)
Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of financial assets and 
liabilities held for trading is based on internally determined 
theoretical prices, which are also used for quoting purposes. 
As such, valuation can be different than closing prices at 
various stock exchanges or different than prices from 
clearers, for example due to market illiquidity, variety in 
opening hours of the stock exchanges and the use of 
hedging instruments.
The fair values recorded could include estimates which are 
subjective by nature. Therefore, we identified the valuation 
of financial assets and liabilities held for trading as 
a significant risk within our audit.
We obtained an understanding of the valuation process, 
including verifications done by the risk and middle office 
department. We performed sample testing on the valuation 
of individual positions by comparing the internally developed 
prices to external sources. 
Furthermore, we inspected the financial statements for 
compliance and consistency with IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 on 
disclosure requirements for financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading, including the fair value hierarchy.
The method of fair value measurement and the underlying 
input for valuation of the financial assets and liabilities held 
for trading is reasonable as well as the fair value hierarchy and 
the disclosure.
Risk
Our audit approach
Key observations 
Digital assets transactions and balances  
(“Our profile”, “Enterprise Risk Management” in Management board report and note 29 of the financial statements)
Flow Traders trades in cryptographically secured digital 
assets (‘cryptocurrencies’). The cryptocurrencies positions 
are recorded as part of financial assets held for trading and 
results recorded as part of trading income. Cryptocurrencies 
are exchangeable directly between two parties through 
decentralized (‘blockchain’) networks that record 
anonymous transaction data. Alternatively direct trades are 
executed between members of non-regulated crypto-
currency exchanges. Ownership of cryptocurrencies is 
determined by whoever has access to the private key 
required to transact cryptocurrencies between wallets. 
Therefore, we recognize a risk in the existence of the crypto-
currency positions. In addition, a risk of incorrect valuation of 
cryptocurrencies exists given the high volatility and large 
number of different exchanges.
We performed procedures to evaluate the design and 
implementation of procedures related to cryptocurrencies 
by Flow Traders, including reviews performed by the risk and 
middle office and the compliance departments in 
onboarding exchanges as well as trading in new cryptocur-
rencies. Furthermore, we evaluated the design and 
implementation of the daily trades reconciliation controls 
and procedures for deposits and withdrawals with crypto-
currency exchanges. Last, by observing the positions at each 
of the exchanges at year end and subsequently testing on 
the valuation of individual positions by comparing the 
internally developed prices to external sources, we indepen-
dently tested the valuation and existence of the cryptocur-
rencies position of Flow Traders at 31 December 2019.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any 
material audit findings in relation to the existence or carrying 
values of the crypto currency assets.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained

we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 and Section 2:135b sub-Section 7 of the

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V. on 19 May 2016, as of 
the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor since that date.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU 
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.
Description of responsibilities for the financial statements
Responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing 
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting 
frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose 
events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in the financial statements. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.

We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine the key audit 
matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the 
matter is in the public interest.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means 
we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on 
our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism 
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements 
and independence requirements. The Our audit approach section above includes an informative 
summary of our responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional 
report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in 
this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.
