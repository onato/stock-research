Profile
Who we are
We are a leading global financial technology-enabled 
liquidity provider in financial products, historically 
specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), now 
expanding into other asset classes. We continuously grow 
our organization, ensuring that our trading desks in Europe, 
the Americas and Asia can provide liquidity across all major 
exchanges, globally, 24 hours a day. Founded in 2004, we 
continue to cultivate the entrepreneurial, innovative and 
team-oriented culture that has been with us since the 
beginning.
What we do
As a technology company operating in the financial 
ecosystem we use our proprietary technology platform to 
quote bid and ask prices in thousands of financial products. 
We also provide liquidity to institutional counterparties 
off-exchange across all regions: the Americas, APAC and 
EMEA. Market participants benefit from higher execution 
quality and lower overall trading costs, while the markets 
benefit from greater efficiency and more transparency. 
As a principal trading firm, we focus on providing liquidity in 
financial products both on- and off-exchange across the 
globe on an ever increasing number of venues and to 
a constantly growing number of institutional counterparties. 
Our strategies are designed to use information that is 
publicly available. We are a strong supporter of fair, 
transparent and orderly markets. We derive our Net Trading 
Income (NTI) from the small price differences at which 
investors are willing to trade financial instruments we 
provide liquidity in and those of the underlying or related 
financial instruments at which we hedge the resulting 
exposures. We generally do not have a directional opinion 
on the markets and aim to be hedged perfectly and 
instantaneously. This focus on risk management is at the 
heart of our organization.

Message of the Management Board
‘Technology and 
trading are 
inseparable from 
the company’s 
success to date, 
and its future 
success’
Flow Traders enjoyed a record year in 2018, as our 
investments in the company’s underlying infrastructure, 
products, people and markets began to yield strong results. 
On the regulatory front, we saw the introduction of MiFID II 
and successfully complied with the CRR capital regulation. 
In London, our newly-opened branch office strengthens our 
UK strategy and brings us closer to our counterparties. 
At the same time, we continued to grow our global OTC 
trading and began providing liquidity in Hong Kong-listed 
ETFs and futures, after receiving our local license at the 
beginning of the year. We also expanded the Management 
Board, appointing Thomas Wolff as Chief Technology Officer 
and Folkert Joling as Chief Trading Officer. These 
appointments highlight that technology and trading are 
inseparable from the company’s success to date, and its 
future success. Marcel Jongmans has resigned as Chief 
Financial Officer, effective 8 December 2018.
Market developments
The market fluctuated during 2018. In the first quarter, 
trading volumes increased significantly as a series of 
geo-political issues heightened market sensitivity. The rest 
of the year was characterized by more subdued market 
dynamics, although market value traded continued to 
remain positive. Towards year-end, more elevated levels of 
market activity were noticeable.

Organic growth strategy
We believe our results in 2018 underpin the strength of the 
growth strategy we have been executing. As well as 
expanding into new regions, this has involved diversifying 
our market making activities into other areas. During the 
year, for example, we began providing liquidity in FX as 
a separate asset class. We also began trading 
cryptocurrencies, a market that has grown rapidly, across 
a range of platforms. We continued to implement 
improvements to our infrastructure, ensuring both our 
hardware and software can support our growing coverage. 
We also worked on preserving our unique culture, which is 
a vital part of the company’s ongoing success. At the same 
time, we expanded the range of courses available within 
Flow Academy, our employee education programme, which 
helped our people progress even further. Without their drive 
and determination, we would be unable to realize what we 
have achieved. On the regulatory front, we successfully 
adjusted to MiFID II, which we believe helps increase 
financial stability and transparency. 
Using data effectively
As we continue to expand into new markets, our technology 
solutions have to become ever-more robust to guarantee 
that we trade securely and efficiently. One emergent aspect 
of this is machine learning, which allows us to realize 
a competitive advantage and unlock potential. 
Looking ahead
As we move into 2019, we will continue to focus on 
increasing our trading relationships, either onscreen or 
bilaterally, and developing the full potential of our London 
and Hong Kong offices. We will also concentrate on 
increasing the diversity of asset classes we trade in. 
Together, these areas are aimed at developing our long-term 
strategy to be the liquidity provider for investors globally, 
enabling them to transfer risk at minimal costs across all 
assets classes and in all available products.
This very successful year was made possible through the 
commitment of the dedicated team at Flow Traders, and we 
would like to extend our thanks to them, as well as our 
shareholders and other stakeholders, for their ongoing 
support and contribution. 
Regards,
Dennis Dijkstra, Folkert Joling, Sjoerd Rietberg and  
Thomas Wolff.

Dividend policy
Flow Traders intends to pay dividends annually in two 
instalments, with a target aggregate dividend pay-out ratio 
of at least 50 percent of the company’s net profits realized 
during the financial year. The Management Board may 
decide, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, that the 
profits realized during a financial year will fully or partially 
be appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. 
A distribution of (interim) dividends is subject to applicable 
rules and regulations, the Articles of Association of the 
company, the By-Laws of the Management Board, and the 
By-Laws of the Supervisory Board.
It is anticipated that our interim dividends will be declared 
and paid following the publication of our results for the first 
half of each year. However, there can be no assurance that in 
any given year a dividend will be proposed or declared.

The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and 
timing thereof will depend on a number of factors, including 
legal and regulatory requirements, future profits, financial 
conditions, general economic and business conditions, 
future prospects and such other factors as the Management 
Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, 
may deem relevant. Our intentions in relation to dividends 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control.
The Management Board, subject to the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, may decide to make allocations to 
reserves and therefore decides how much of the profit will 
be allocated to reserves. The profits remaining shall be at 
the disposal of the General Meeting. 
Reserves and dividend proposal for the financial year 
2018
Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the company’s Articles of 
Association, the Management Board, with the approval of 
the Supervisory Board, has decided that of the profit for 
2018 (totaling € 160.9 million), an amount of € 52 million shall 
be added to the reserves. The remaining amount of € 108.9 
million is at the disposal of the General Meeting of 
Shareholders (General Meeting).

We provide liquidity in financial products, 
historically with a focus on exchange-traded 
products (ETPs). ETPs are baskets of securities 
made up of shares, bonds, commodities or 
alternative products. ETPs often track indices 
and, unlike most mutual funds, can be traded 
throughout the day on trading venues. We do this 
globally, enabling investors to buy and sell ETPs 
efficiently by quoting bid and ask prices under 
virtually all market circumstances. In 2018 we 
have made the first step in diversifying our 
market making activities into other asset classes, 
like Foreign Exchange (FX). The modularity of our 
Trading infrastructure allows for efficient 
leverage on our trading capabilities in all financial 
products and not only ETPs.
Markets & Trends
Our business
In 2018 we traded in well over 10,000 financial instruments, 
and have access to more than 161 trading venues in 40 
countries around the world. We provide liquidity in over 
6,500 ETP listings on- and off-exchange, which is over 50 
percent of all ETPs globally.
Off-exchange, we provide liquidity in ETPs on a request-
for-quote basis to almost 1,000 institutional counterparties 
across the globe, including banks, asset managers, pension 
funds, insurance companies, family offices, hedge funds, 
and others and this number is increasing on an almost daily 
basis. 
In addition to ETPs we provide liquidity in similar instruments 
whose value is correspondingly affected by a change in the 
value of underlying or related assets, such as futures or 
bonds. 
In 2018, we began providing liquidity as a market maker in 
FX. We are continuously providing liquidity in an increasing 
number of currencies on-screen and over the counter (OTC) 
to a fast-growing number of counterparties.
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider we 
generally do not have a directional opinion on the market. 
In other words, our results do not depend on the direction of 
market prices. Our Net Trading Income (NTI) is realized 
through the small price differences that are realized 
between buying and selling related or correlating assets. 
Whether that is between the ETPs we buy or sell, and the 
prices we pay or receive for the underlying or related 
financial instruments to mitigate our risk, or trading FX pairs.
The ETP market
The popularity of ETPs has continued to grow in recent 
years. According to asset manager BlackRock Advisors, 
global ETP Assets under Management (AuM) grew from 
€3,962 billion in 2017 to €4,192 billion by the end of 2018. 
This growth is expected to continue, with sources such as 
BlackRock, PwC, Boston Consulting Group and EY predicting 
that the market will grow further to over $ 7.6 trillion by 
2020, as investors continue to invest in low-cost, 
transparent and easy-to-trade passive investment 
strategies. This contributes to the long-term value creation 
of Flow Traders’ strategy.
We believe there are a number of reasons for this trend to 
continue, including beyond 2020: one is that investors are 
attracted to the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables 
them to follow clearly how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid and 
available at low-cost and can be bought and sold easily 
during market hours. A third reason is that ETPs can be 
composed of financial instruments from almost any asset 
class, sector or location, giving investors access to markets 
that would normally be difficult to reach.

Besides creating a strong foothold for institutional trading, 
our new London branch office further serves departments 
such as Institutional Trading and Recruitment in their daily 
operations.
In APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with large 
differences in trading volumes, trading costs, regulation and 
maturity across the financial markets. Volumes traded in the 
APAC region remain dominated by the top-10 most traded 
ETP products, as those 10 determine roughly 55-65 percent 
of the total market volumes. The total ETP value traded 
(on-exchange and off-exchange) was €2.2 trillion in 2018, 
including China, while the total ETP value traded at our 
Singapore office was €35 billion. With our Hong Kong and 
Singapore office together now providing liquidity in the 
APAC region, Flow Traders had a successful year in 2018 in 
APAC, confirming the contribution of investments made in 
2017 and 2018 in the region. 
ETP market remains high growth market
We still see significant opportunities for growth in the ETP 
market, driven by the widely expected expansion of this 
industry in the near future. This is due to a number of 
changes within the asset management industry, including: 
◾
◾
The continuing shift to global electronic trading, which 
cuts costs and maximizes efficiency and transparency;
◾
◾
A shift in asset growth from active strategies to more 
cost-effective, passive strategies;
◾
◾
Increasing ETP adoption globally among institutions, 
intermediaries and retail investors;
◾
◾
Long-term shifts driven by regulators looking to 
increase financial stability and transparency.
To take advantage of this expected growth, we aim to 
expand our presence further in all areas of ETP trading in all 
regions.
Review of 2018 
Global ETP markets grew by only 6 percent in 2018 
measured in AuM driven by adverse market conditions in 
December 2018. Annual global inflows of ETP AuM were 
€450 billion in 2018 (2017: €554 billion – source BlackRock 
Global ETP Landscape December 2018), resulting in the 
second best year after 2017. Overall trading activity in 2018 
picked up, with investors anticipating on geopolitical 
developments and decisions by Central Banks to stop their 
quantitative easing programs. 
Global coverage
Flow Traders has expanded substantially in 2018. We opened 
offices in Hong Kong and London, which means that Flow 
Traders now trades globally from five offices, in Amsterdam, 
Hong Kong, London, New York and Singapore. 
The largest ETP market is still in the United States, where 
total ETP value traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) was 
€21.8 trillion in 2018. Our New York office’s total ETP value 
traded was € 391 billion in 2018, an improvement versus 2017 
and, for the second year in a row, a record year for Flow 
Traders US since inception. With institutional trading gaining 
further momentum in 2018, Flow Traders US continued to 
grow its overall presence. 
The EMEA ETP market had a total ETP value traded of €1.35 
trillion in 2018. Our total ETP value traded from our Europe 
offices was €474 billion in 2018. We remained the number 
one liquidity provider in ETPs in EMEA and managed to grow 
our on- and off exchange presence further. We opened 
a branch office in London, United Kingdom in the fourth 
quarter. The opening of a branch office fits within our UK 
strategy and the expanding ETP industry and regulatory 
developments, alongside other asset classes such as FX.

enabling them to switch exposures at any given moment 
during trading days. There are broadly three main categories 
within ETPs in which we trade: 
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
This category is the most traded, when compared to ETCs 
and ETNs. ETFs derive their value from shares or bonds held 
in proportion to an index. For example, a Euro Stoxx 50 ETF 
would hold the same shares as the Euro Stoxx 50 index, in 
approximately the same proportions. Fixed-income ETFs 
derive their value from a portfolio of debt instruments. 
For example, bonds included in the Barclays US Treasury 1-3 
Year Term Index. ETFs are the most widespread among ETPs 
as measured by AuM.
Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs)
ETCs typically derive their value from a commodity index, 
such as the Bloomberg Commodity Index, although in some 
cases they derive it from just a single commodity, such as 
gold or oil, or a certain currency. For example, the SPDR 
Gold Shares ETC tracks the value of physical gold. ETCs may 
hold physical assets, but exposure can also be held through 
derivatives of the underlying commodity, in combination 
with cash.
Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)
ETNs are a type of unsecured, unsubordinated debt 
securities issued by an underwriting bank. The returns of 
ETNs are based on the performance of the index being 
tracked. For example, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term 
Futures Index TR ETN would track the S&P 500 VIX 
Short-Term Futures volatility index.
visibility in the region ever since, supporting our institutional 
trading and reaffirming our role in the ETP ecosystem in the 
region.
In general, we believe growth can accelerate in all regions in 
the coming years, as electronic trading continues to evolve 
and we increasingly leverage on our technology and trading 
knowledge to diversify in other financial products, such as 
FX and other financial products where we see an 
opportunity. In terms of the ongoing discussions on 
regulation, we continue to anticipate changes that further 
support a level playing field.
Products
ETPs
Exchange Traded Products, the main products that we trade, 
are often compared to mutual funds mainly because they 
are both baskets of shares, bonds, or commodities. However, 
that is where the similarity ends. Unlike most mutual funds, 
the majority of ETPs simply tracks an index without trying to 
beat such indices. ETPs have open-ended fund structures 
rather than closed-end and, unlike mutual funds, can be 
continuously bought and sold on trading venues during 
trading hours and off-exchange at all times. 
They provide investors with exposure to a wide variety of 
underlying assets, ranging from ETPs that replicate the 
composition of a particular equity index, to those that 
provide investors with exposure to assets in specific sectors 
or countries, to commodities, or to currencies. ETPs also 
enable investors to create and manage diversified 
investment portfolios in an efficient manner, as well as 
In Europe we continue to grow our presence on different 
venues and grow the number of counterparties. We have 
established a connection with virtually all ETP issuers active 
in Europe and we continued to grow our institutional 
counterparty-base substantially in 2018. Until now, MiFID II 
developments have shown a beneficial impact on our 
counterparty base, as investors increased their focus on best 
execution, regardless of research access. With the expansion 
of the offices to London and the launch of the FX liquidity 
providing, we have the building blocks in place to increase 
our presence in Europe in 2019.
In the Americas, our ETP value traded continued to grow 
substantially in 2018, but remains relatively limited 
compared to the market size. We believe there is significant 
growth potential in fixed income ETFs, developed market 
equity ETFs and institutional trading. Institutional trading 
continued to gain mass in 2018 and is expected to grow 
further in 2019. We will continue to expand the number of 
products traded, the number of venues we trade on and the 
number of counterparties we are connected to in the US.
In Asia we continue to increase our participation in the 
markets where we are already active and expand into new 
markets. At the same time, we remain focused on markets 
that are potentially opening up, such as China, by capitalizing 
on our experience and increasing our business development 
capacities. In order to facilitate our future growth, we 
opened an office in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter of 2017, 
received the license from the Hong Kong regulator (the 
Securities and Futures Commission) required to become an 
Exchange Participant of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 
January 2018, and we have been increasing our footprint and

The ETP ecosystem
The ETP ecosystem is made up of a number of participants 
who together make ETP investing and trading possible. 
These include investors, ETP issuers, exchanges and other 
trading venues and authorized participants, who can also act 
as liquidity providers, such as Flow Traders. The ETP 
ecosystem can be further divided into two markets: the 
primary market and the secondary market.
Primary market
Interaction in the primary market takes place between 
authorized participants (APs) and the issuers, who either 
issue or cancel ETPs. This is done in reaction to market 
demand and is called the creation and redemption process. 
Authorized participants can create ETPs with the issuer by 
transferring the underlying assets (or cash equivalent) to the 
issuer in return for a corresponding number of newly issued 
ETPs. This increases the ETP’s AuM. In this way, the issuance 
of ETPs through authorized participants provides the issuers 
with access to a broad investor market without having to 
support a complex and costly trading infrastructure which 
would be non-core to their business. Redemption is the 
reverse of the creation process: the authorized participant 
transfers ETPs to their issuer in exchange for the underlying 
assets (or a cash equivalent). The issuer then cancels the 
ETPs it received. This decreases the ETP’s AuM. 
Secondary market
The secondary market is where ETP trading takes place 
between market participants, similar to the trading of 
ordinary shares, at market-determined prices. Secondary 
market participants include institutional and retail investors, 
liquidity providers and authorized participants. Secondary 
markets include exchanges and other automated trading 
venues, as well as off-exchange trading between market 
participants such as large institutional investors.

pre-trade risk controls, and other risk and compliance tools. 
This is the main reason that our technology department 
makes up over 40 percent of our total staff.
One of our software platform’s core features is its modular 
design, which allows us to rapidly test and implement 
ongoing enhancements. This also means we can easily and 
cost-effectively expand our coverage of securities, asset 
classes, and geographical markets as we grow the business.
In 2018 our total technology expenses declined by 5 percent 
versus 2017. Control on expenses tightened and resulted in 
a decrease in expenses, without lowering the support it gave 
to the improvements in our infrastructure and the growth in 
the number of trading venues. In 2018 our technology 
expenses were 39 percent of our total fixed expenses. 
Including salaries this would be 51 percent (55 percent in 
2017), which highlights our focus on technology as part of 
our business model. The number of technology FTEs grew 
from 143 to 162, also confirming our overall growth.
Real-time risk management 
Identifying and monitoring risk
We manage risk effectively across the company. Within the 
trading environment we monitor our trades and positions, 
market exposure, portfolio efficiency, and liquidity on 
a real-time basis. Our risk management system is tightly 
linked to our trading platform, analyzing pricing data and 
ensuring that our order activity is conducted within 
pre-determined trading and position limits. At the same 
time, the system reconciles internal transaction records 
against those of our prime brokers and exchanges where 
possible. Off-exchange we use strict risk management 
the primary and the secondary ETP market and allow us to 
either create or redeem the ETPs and optimize our role as 
a leading liquidity provider in ETPs.
Pricing
Pricing ETPs accurately 
Being able to accurately price the ETPs that we provide 
liquidity in is vital to the success of our business. Get it 
wrong, and we risk not winning the trade or losing money 
due to bad prices. Our experience in establishing the pricing 
relationship between the ETPs and the underlying assets in 
a variety of market conditions means we can offer 
competitive bid and ask prices, while still covering our 
trading costs and locking in transaction profit. We achieve 
this using pre-set hedging strategies, which (where possible) 
instantly reduce our market exposure, creating a market-
neutral position. Hedging strategies like these enable us to 
trade ETPs in such a way that our Net Trading Income is 
virtually unaffected by any price movements of the 
underlying or related securities. 
Cutting edge proprietary technology 
platform
Developing software in-house 
We are a technology company operating in the financial 
industry. As such, technology lies at the heart of our 
business, enabling us to provide liquidity in a variety of 
market environments across the globe. We trade using 
proprietary and scalable software with the vast majority of 
our applications developed in-house. These include pricing 
and trading software, market data processing tools, 
FX
Flow Traders started providing liquidity in FX as a separate 
asset class in 2018, trading first on Fastmatch, followed soon 
thereafter by other platforms, such as CBOE FX and 
Currenex. This marks an important step for the company, as 
it is the first time we have started providing liquidity in a new 
asset class, alongside ETPs. Flow Traders has always been 
present in the FX market, across all platforms, as a price 
taker to mitigate our risk when trading ETPs. We recognized 
there was an opportunity to provide liquidity in an 
increasingly transparent market, which also connects 
strongly to our ETP universe. We now provide liquidity in an 
increasing number of FX pairs on spot and futures in the 
EMEA market to a fast-growing number of counterparties 
on an expanding number of platforms. 
Liquidity Provider
Leading liquidity provider
Flow Traders has two main roles in the financial ecosystem. 
The first is as a liquidity provider. In this role, we help 
maintain and improve the overall transparency and 
efficiency of the ecosystem, by quoting bid and ask prices 
for financial products like ETPs, FX and other products on 
trading venues, as well as off-exchange to institutional 
investors, which market participants can trade against. 
By providing liquidity we make it easier for investors to buy 
and sell financial products at a price that should reflect the 
(relation with the) current price of the underlying asset, and 
contribute to lower trading costs.
 
Another role we play in the ETP landscape is as an 
authorized participant (AP). We have AP-agreements in 
place with all the major ETP issuers. These agreements link

approval and monitoring procedures for institutional trading 
counterparties. Additionally, we settle almost all of our 
off-exchange trades through delivery-versus-payment, 
which means that the delivery of securities occurs 
simultaneously with payment by the buyer, thus limiting 
counterparty risk. For more information, please refer to the 
chapter Our Risk Management.
Strategy 
Our strategic ambition
Our ambition is to be a one-stop shop for liquidity in the 
global financial markets.
Our market
We operate in a highly competitive market that is changing 
rapidly. It is characterized by heightened regulation and an 
ever-increasing focus on technology. Yet the market’s core 
function remains the same: transferring risk between 
market participants. This is where we add value. Our focus 
will continue to be on providing liquidity in more and more 
products in the financial markets with still a focus on ETPs. 
Our business principles
Our business principles are being flexible, agile and being 
focused on continuous improvements. To be successful, we 
recognize that we need to perform well across all areas of 
the business. Achieving this involves diligently studying the 
markets and our responses to them, and using our resources 
where they have the greatest impact. The outcome of this 
process defines whether or not we have a competitive edge.
Our strategy 
We will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing to grow 
our business. This should result in increasing our NTI, while 
maintaining our desired risk profile, controlling costs, and 
securing and attracting the right talent. Increasing our NTI

involves increasing the product of volume and the net 
margin we capture per trade, where volume is the value of 
products we trade and the net margin is the margin we 
capture per trade after the corresponding exposure has 
been hedged. Our risk profile is characterized by having no 
opinion on market movement or direction. By expanding our 
presence as a liquidity provider in both the ETPs and 
underlying asset classes, Flow Traders can maximize the 
growth of its NTI. 
By growing our presence in the global financial market as 
a liquidity provider, Flow Traders builds a foundation to 
support its long term growth trend. As is shown in the figure 
below, Flow Traders has grown its NTI consistently since 
2010. By growing our presence in the underlying asset 
classes, Flow Traders expects to even improve its 
performance in the future, also in times where the trading 
activity in the market may slow down.

expenses grew by 7.1 percent, helped by especially tight 
control on our technology expenses. This contributed to an 
EBITDA margin in 2018 of 52 percent (2017: 34 percent). 
Going forward, we reiterate our fixed costs growth guidance 
of a maximum rate of 15 percent annually. 
Capital base
During the year we continued to maintain a strong, stable 
capital base, comfortably exceeding both our regulatory 
and prime broker capital requirements. We paid out a €1.35 
interim dividend in August 2018 and propose to pay €1.00 as 
a final dividend over 2018. Over the course of 2018 we 
therefore aim to return a total of €2.35 through dividends to 
our shareholders, which represents a 68 percent dividend 
pay-out ratio. 
We complied with the regulatory capital requirement of the 
EU Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) well before the 
deadline of 31 March 2018. After detailed assessment, we 
implemented the requirements applicable, which confirmed 
the solid capital base we have always had. At 31 December 
2018, our regulatory capital requirements under CRR were 
€168 million. As Flow Traders’ capital maintained at €278 
million and this resulted in an excess capital position of €110 
million.
Growth
We continued to grow our team, strategies and 
infrastructure in 2018. We increased our institutional 
counterparties globally to over 1,000, increased the number 
of products in which we provide liquidity to over 6,500 and 
increased the number of venues connected to 161. 
To facilitate this growth, we continued to grow the business 
during the year across all regions, resulting in an increase in 
the number of FTEs to 436 by year-end (2017: 394).
trillion), of which €899 billion (2017 €686 billion) was traded 
in ETPs. The rest was traded in related financial products to 
facilitate competitive pricing in ETPs. Market ETP value 
traded rose to €25.4 trillion, (2017: €18.5 trillion). 
This highlights the impact of the changes in market 
conditions we witnessed in 2018. On top of the changes in 
market conditions, the exceptional market activity in 
February contributed to a record annual performance, 
confirming the potential of our business model. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, Flow Traders delivered 
a strong finish to what was already a record year. Financial 
markets turned more cautious, Flow Traders total value 
traded increased 52 percent quarter-on-quarter, as velocity 
increased strongly. Flow Traders reported an NTI of €74.1 
million in 4Q18, realizing the best NTI ever realized in the 
fourth quarter.
Market volatility
In 2018 market volatility recovered from the lows witnessed 
in 2017. The main volatility took place at the beginning of 
February, after which market volatility slowed down again. 
VIX fell back to levels around 15-20, which was well above 
those in 2017. Towards the end of 2018, market activity picked 
up again as tensions around geopolitical developments rose, 
causing the VIX to trade at levels between 15-35.
Operational expenses
Our fixed operational expenses developed well within the 
guided fixed cost growth rate of maximum 15 percent 
annually. While on one hand we continued to invest in our 
people and technology to ensure future growth, our FTEs 
grew 10.7 percent to 436 year end 2018, on the other hand 
we improved efficiency and kept a tight control on 
execution and process management. Due to this focus, fixed 
Financial overview
Net Trading Income
The 2018 macro-economic topics linked to the United 
States’ domestic politics and foreign affairs, especially 
around Europe and China, as well as the turmoil surrounding 
Turkey and Italy, impacted markets and affected trading 
activity. Besides that, Central Banks reduced or stopped 
their quantitative easing programs. This made it difficult for 
investors to predict market developments, leading to 
a pickup in market trading activities. 
Our NTI developed strongly in 2018, supported by the 
exceptional market circumstances at the beginning of 
February. Our 2018 NTI rose to €383 million (2017: €166 
million), our highest NTI level since inception. Flow Traders’ 
total value traded in 2018 grew to €3.6 trillion (2017: €2.9

Our success is driven by a combination of smart 
trading strategies, state-of-the-art proprietary 
technology and prudent risk management. 
Our people are critical in delivering on these 
items, which is why we aim to recruit and retain 
the best talent available.
Culture
Open, informal and diverse culture
Our work environment is a reflection of the things we 
believe in. We believe that it is more important how you 
perform than what you wear. So our employees dress 
comfortably for work – jeans, t-shirts and sneakers are 
common. We believe that what someone says is more 
important than who says it. We believe that the 
contributions of our team-members are crucial to the 
success of the company. We believe that two people know 
more than one, and that people can have great ideas even in 
areas different to their core expertise. Therefore, we 
welcome and encourage everyone to share their opinions. 
Anyone with a good idea, whether it is in their own area of 
expertise or another, is encouraged to put this forward. 
This is part of our open, informal and diverse culture.
One of our core values is ownership, and we mean this in 
terms of mindset and behavior as well as literally. We believe 
that being a shareholder aligns the interests of the company 
with those of our employees. To promote shareholding and 
reward loyalty we award company shares to employees 
marking their two-year anniversary. 
Our employees include people from different backgrounds 
and nationalities. We have economists, engineers, computer 
scientists, mathematicians, lawyers and physicists amongst 
our employees. We harbor people from 45 different 
nationalities (2017: 43). This diversity ensures different 
viewpoints are brought into discussions, and we believe this 
leads to better, more innovative outcomes for the company.

Attracting Talent
How we recruit
Our offices are all growing, and we look to hire as many 
qualified applicants as we can find. However, our selection 
standards remain high – our candidates need to go through 
a number of tests and interviews, with less than 1 percent of 
applicants for trading positions ultimately receiving a job 
offer. To find people with the unique skill sets needed for 
a global liquidity provider we recruit across the globe, 
advertising and searching across multiple platforms. 
We also visit campuses in India, Hong Kong, Australia, 
Singapore, the US, and across Europe, meeting talents in 
career fairs and workshops. We recruit for all disciplines and 
look for the best caliber available, regardless of their gender, 
age, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. Our recruitment 
strategy contributes to numbers 5 and 10 of the United 
Nations Sustainability Development Goals, aiming to 
promote Gender Equality and reducing inequalities.
Junior traders are typically recruited straight from university. 
Although our traders have a varied educational background, 
they share a strong numerical aptitude, which is why 
a numerical test is an important part of the selection 
procedure. To experience the world of trading first hand, we 
invite a select group of students to our Business Courses in 
our Amsterdam and New York offices. The two-day event is 
packed with interesting and challenging trading exercises 
and simulations and includes quantitative and technical 
cases to mirror the evolving nature of the role. In a similar 
fashion, we host the “Flow Traders Arbitrage Challenge” case 
competition in Singapore and Hong Kong. We also host 
numerous informal events such as the annual poker 
tournaments in Amsterdam, Australia and New York, chess 
tournaments in Amsterdam, and trading competitions in 
select universities in Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong 
and Singapore.
To facilitate greater opportunities for young talent in 
technology, we successfully launched the Graduate 
Software Development program in 2018 and will continue 
investing in its development with new graduates joining in 
2019.
Candidates for other roles are qualified specialists who have 
relevant work experience. We make very little use of 
contractors or temporary employees. 
In 2018 we continued hosting, participating in, and 
sponsoring a variety of events, ranging from in-house days, 
an inspirational women’s event, and various meet ups. 
With the opening of our new London branch, we have 
increased our presence in the relevant universities in the UK 
and held multiple recruitment campaigns. 
Management Scope Corporate Impact Index is a ranking 
for sustainable employment. In 2018, we were one of four 
companies that achieved the highest score in the area of 
employment, according to the Management Scope 
Corporate Impact Index. Management Scope highlighted 
our attractive employment conditions, and noted that we 
maintain a culture in which employees feel that they can 
remain true to themselves.
In 2018, we won the Talent Award for Best Employer Brand 
on LinkedIn. LinkedIn awards this recognition to companies 
based on their utilization of LinkedIn Solutions and 
activities on the LinkedIn platform. We received the award 
based on the following criteria: Engagement, Reach, 
LinkedIn life page completeness score, and Employer 
branding posts score.

compensation structure as an important tool to stimulate 
teamwork and risk awareness and to reward performance. 
For example, awarding variable remuneration and payment 
of deferred variable remuneration depends on the future 
profitability of the company, which means we only award 
variable remuneration, or pay-deferred remuneration, if 
there is sufficient profit and capital to do so. 
For information on companywide average compensation 
please refer to the chapter Remuneration.
Shares held by employees and 
Management Board members
We encourage our management and employees to invest in 
Flow Traders, linking the company’s long-term success to 
their personal financial circumstances. Our Co-CEOs and 
a significant number of current and former employees have 
invested in Flow Traders in the past at fair value, using their 
own net worth. Following our IPO, these shares remained 
subject to lock-up provisions and the relevant people may 
only transfer or sell their shares as set out below:
◾
◾
up to 331/3 percent of these shares became available for 
sale on 10 July 2016;
◾
◾
up to 662/3 percent of these shares became available for 
sale on 10 July 2017;
◾
◾
all of these shares became available for sale on 10 July 
2018.
Our new hires in trading and technology start with an 
intensive introduction program, bringing them up to speed 
with our way of working and training them in the specific 
skills they need to do their job well. All junior traders – 
including those hired for our Asian and the US offices – 
begin their global training program at our offices in 
Amsterdam. 
Training and rotation
We help our employees shape their own future. Via our 
internal learning platform, the Flow Academy, we offer 
everyone varied training opportunities, aimed at improving 
function-specific skills or for their own personal 
development. In 2018, we further expanded the available 
offerings, with both online and live training session formats. 
Most of our managers are ‘home-grown’, having developed 
into their positions after a number of years working with the 
company. They set an example and act as an inspiration for 
new hires, illustrating the career paths open to them. 
To further support them in their personal growth, 
a leadership development program was introduced in 2018.
To complement self-growth, we also like to give our 
employees the chance to transfer between our offices and 
experience life and work elsewhere. 
Remuneration
We reward our uniquely skilled employees with an attractive 
combination of fixed and variable pay. When awarding 
variable compensation, we look beyond an employee’s 
individual results or direct area of responsibility. The variable 
pay element depends on company performance, individual 
performance, and how an employee contributed to the 
long-term success of the company as a whole. We use this 
Engage and Invest
Our offices
All our offices are designed to provide a pleasant and 
ergonomically sound place to work. They are flooded with 
light, have attractive, well laid out interiors and 
ergonomically-optimized furniture. In addition, to give our 
people the opportunity to perform at their best, we offer 
healthy breakfast and lunch options, have our own bar in 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong, London, New York and Singapore, 
and organize great company trips and parties. 
In Amsterdam, we also have our own in-house gym facilities. 
We not only use our newly-designed bars for after work 
gatherings, but also for recruiting events and quarterly staff 
updates. We believe these benefits are important to 
maintain a healthy and happy workforce and to stimulate 
bonding and connections beyond employees’ direct circle of 
colleagues, helping to encourage teamwork across the 
whole company.
Onboarding
We are a fast growing company, which creates good jobs 
across a variety of departments. In 2018 we had over 80 new 
hires, resulting in approximately a 10 percent increase in the 
number of employees versus 2017. Our new colleagues join 
us from all parts of the world. To make sure they feel at 
home quickly we offer full relocation support for everyone 
moving to our offices from abroad. We help with finding 
a home, applying for a visa and getting to know the local 
culture. We also offer our international employees based in 
Amsterdam the opportunity to attend Dutch language 
classes.

Sustainability statement 
Our activities influence the society we live in. As a liquidity 
provider we are active on global financial markets and we 
contribute to transparency and to the pricing process, 
enabling market participants to invest at fair prices and 
lower costs. Our activities contribute to sustainable 
employment and technological innovation in our society 
and we are committed to full compliance and integrity. 
We seek to limit our environmental footprint and 
contribute to our society and immediate vicinity.
Our activities do not involve the production, use, processing 
or transport of physical goods. However, sustainable 
business and value creation is of high importance to Flow 
Traders. We aim to reach a sustainable environment by 
means of – amongst others – our environmental footprint, 
societal commitment and commitment to charity and our 
Equal Opportunity Policy.
We are committed to creating long-term value for all, taking 
into account all our relevant stakeholder groups, including 
shareholders and employees. 
We are aware of our impact on society while executing our 
business strategy. Five themes summarize our interaction 
with society: 
1	
We offer liquidity to financial markets;
2	
We offer sustainable employment;
3	
We are committed to full compliance and integrity;
4	
We are committed to fair taxation and transparency in 
financial reporting; 
5	
We are involved in society, and our local environment.
1.	 We offer liquidity to financial markets
We contribute to transparency and the effective operation 
of global financial markets by providing liquidity to markets 
globally. We facilitate that thousands of exchange-traded 
products (ETPs) and other financial products can be traded 
across the world’s markets, by continuously quoting bid and 
ask prices. As an innovative segment of global financial 
markets, ETPs have introduced efficiencies and cut 
investment costs substantially for a wide range of investors, 
from pension funds to retail investors. Increased liquidity, 
higher execution quality, and lower overall trading costs are 
just some of the benefits that liquidity providers, such as 
Flow Traders, offer through these innovative financial 
products compared to more traditional investment 
products. 
Our role is to enable trading in widely diversified investment 
products to anyone at any time, allowing end-investors to 
invest with lower costs and thus produce potentially higher 
returns. As a result, over the years, trading costs have 
dropped dramatically and access to transparent and 
inexpensive investment products for anyone, and not only 
the happy few, has never been more efficient. This benefits 
institutional investors, individual investors and, ultimately, 
society at large.
Stakeholder dialogue
We enter the public dialogue with full transparency. 
Our contributions to the regulatory dialogue are typically 
made public and we are always willing to discuss what we do, 
and how that impacts the world around us. We have 
extensive dialogues with interest groups, including those 
focusing on transparency, institutional and retail 
shareholder interests, academia and students, local 
governments, regulators and anyone else who has an 
interest in what we do, and how we do it. We commit to being 
approachable and fully transparent with the goal to promote 
fairness, transparency and the orderly functioning of the 
financial markets.

programs in a wide variety of subjects, including culture, 
technology, regulatory developments, trading for 
non-traders, and the Whistleblower Policy, including 
anti-corruption, as well as a diverse offer of on-site 
trainings. For additional information, please refer to the 
chapter Our People.
Employee dialogue
We take good care of our people and stakeholders. 
We ensure a high-quality working environment, fair 
treatment and equal remuneration principles for all our 
staff, including contractors, regardless of gender, tenure or 
personal factors. All employees and contractors have 
unrestricted, direct access to senior management and are 
regularly informed and consulted about key developments. 
People are encouraged to speak their minds to help make 
Flow Traders better. Information travels freely and is not 
restricted unless we need to protect overriding interests, 
such as those concerning regulations, commercial 
sensitivities or to protect our intellectual property. 
In addition, we hold regular employee surveys, including one 
carried out by ‘Great Place to Work’, an independent 
company. Great Place to Work receives our employees’ 
insights on how the company is doing and their experiences 
about their day-to-day workplace. Flow Traders follows up 
on the comments by discussing the various topics that can 
be improved and by taking concrete actions.
3.	 We are committed to full compliance 
and integrity
Flow Traders is a strong proponent of effective, efficient and 
equal regulation and contributes to the regulatory dialogue 
in our key jurisdictions as we want markets to be fair, 
proportion of male employees. As also underpinned in the 
Corporate Governance Code we have an Equal Opportunity 
Policy in place. Please refer to the chapter Our Governance 
for further information. 
Remuneration
We believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and office are 
entitled to receive a variable compensation relative to their 
contribution to the firm as a whole. We are transparent 
about how we pay our people and how much we pay them, 
including management. We have a straight-forward 
Remuneration Policy that permits variable pay only when 
a profit is made. We are continuously looking for ways to 
improve our remuneration principles. And because variable 
remuneration is, to a large extent, deferred, it remains at risk 
of forfeiture in the case that we sustain a loss. We believe 
this is the strongest incentive for sustainable, risk-aware 
behavior for all our staff. In addition, we promote employee 
shareholding through the Flow Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP), an 
employee share purchase plan, and the Flow Loyalty 
Incentive Plan, a loyalty plan (FLIP), particularly at more 
senior levels. This aligns the interests of the company with 
those of our employees by creating ‘skin in the game’. 
Please refer to the chapters Our People and Remuneration 
for more information.
Education
We provide our people with a range of excellent training 
programs, benefitting them and the company. New hires 
within the Trading and Technology departments follow 
rigorous initial training. All our new employees receive an 
introduction to Flow Traders through the Flow Academy. 
It includes an online and on-site training that provides 
2.	 We offer sustainable employment
By creating and maintaining high-quality jobs we help 
develop a stable and trusting working environment that 
benefits our people, our business, and society. Since we 
started in 2004, our goal has been to foster a culture that 
encourages innovation, entrepreneurialism and 
risk-awareness, while focusing on drive, teamwork and 
ownership. Developing talent in-house and maintaining 
a committed and substantial employee shareholder base 
strengthens internal bonds and helps create a loyal, 
forward-looking team. We invest in employees for the long 
run. We encourage our people to move between offices 
internationally, to share ideas and best practices across the 
company, while experiencing life in different cultures. 
Although our business does not directly affect human rights 
issues, we are strong proponents of ensuring fair and equal 
treatment for all and expect the same from our employees, 
relationships and stakeholders.
Diversity
We believe that a diverse workforce helps create a richer 
variety of ideas and provides better solutions to the 
challenges we face. We have a long-standing policy of 
recruiting and retaining the best talent available and aim to 
provide an inclusive work environment regardless of the 
gender, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation of our 
employees. We are committed to providing equal 
employment opportunities to all qualified job applicants. 
As a result, we employ people from 45 nationalities across 
our offices. The composition of our workforce tracks the 
outflow of the education system in the various roles we 
offer at Flow Traders. We strongly encourage women to 
apply for any function within the firm, particularly when they 
have a background in fields that traditionally have a higher

any recipient, and no gifts nor favors of any substantial 
value may be given to authorities. Facilitation payments are 
not permitted. We provide clear and recurring guidance in 
that respect. As part of our constant monitoring, all 
expenses and gifts relating to external parties are checked 
by senior managers and employees have to state what the 
purpose of an expense was and who was the recipient.
Whistleblowers
On top of our very strong culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have an elaborate Whistleblower 
Policy in place for all staff and relevant contractors, 
approved by the Management Board and Supervisory Board. 
Employees are free to raise issues and have the 
responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, or any 
reasonable suspicions. During 2018, all employees were 
required to participate in an online course on the 
Whistleblower Policy, as part of the Flow Academy. Every 
new hire will receive this course going forward.
Circumstances may arise that cause an employee to feel 
insecure or unsafe to the extent that they may not want to 
use the usual reporting lines. The company provides 
employees with a safe way of reporting suspected 
misconducts within its organization and offers adequate 
protection. The Whistleblower Policy has wide applications, 
including in respect of topics such as fraud, market abuse, 
corruption, anti-money laundering, theft, bribery and any 
other structural misconduct that threatens the integrity and 
proper business conduct of Flow Traders. The Whistleblower 
Policy provides whistleblowers with anonymity, 
confidentiality, and the company will not impose sanctions 
on disclosure (or affect an employee’s legal position) when 
the employee reports a suspected misconduct in good faith, 
unless the employee is involved in the issue that is being 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
We commit to complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations that apply to us, wherever we operate, including 
in respect of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering laws. Integrity and transparency is central to the 
way we run our business, from our Management Board and 
Supervisory Board to all our staff, regardless of their role. 
The company encourages an open culture within its 
organization and expects its employees to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations and internal policies. 
Each employee is responsible for conducting business 
ethically and honestly. We have issued a Code of Conduct, 
which forms part of our employment documentation. 
This Code of Conduct can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
Anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
We have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering (AML) policies in place that apply to all our staff. 
We expect our counterparties, business partners, 
intermediaries, contractors and subcontractors to adhere to 
the same standards. We believe that the risk of bribery or 
corruption is very limited as we do not hold or manage client 
money or assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain production 
facilities or source raw materials. Nevertheless, staff 
receives training in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and AML 
practices, as the Management Board underlines the 
importance of these trainings.
Key to our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy is that 
officials or counterparties may never be placed in an 
uncomfortable position. No gifts nor favors may lead (or 
have the appearance to lead) to obligations or embarrass 
reported. We respect a non-retaliation policy when 
a suspected misconduct is reported. Flow Traders’ 
Whistleblower Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
4.	 We are committed to fair taxation and 
transparency in financial reporting
Fair taxation
We are committed to being good corporate citizens, bringing 
positive value to the communities we operate in. We pay 
taxes where they are due and subscribe to fair taxation, both 
in terms of corporate taxes and wage taxation. In 2018 we 
paid total corporate income taxes of €33.0 million which was 
8.6 percent of our NTI.
Principles of financial reporting and tax policy
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of its 
financial reporting and its relations with tax authorities 
globally. With regard to financial reporting, conservative 
accounting principles are being applied and one-offs must 
occur infrequently and be clearly documented. 
As aforementioned, Flow Traders operates a fair, transparent 
and straightforward tax policy, which we believe is important 
when running a sustainable business and delivering 
long-term value to all our stakeholders. The dialogue we 
have with stakeholders includes discussions on the 
company’s financial reporting and tax policy and, as with all 
stakeholder input, is considered during our decision making 
process, but so far has not lead in a desire from the 
stakeholders to change our tax policy. The open dialogue 
towards our financial reporting and tax policy has not 
resulted in any material requests to change our reporting or

tax policy. For every business decision, tax aspects are 
presented and weighed as part of the decision making 
process. The commercial needs will in no circumstances 
override compliance with (tax) laws and they strive to be 
compliant with the spirit of the law. The company supports 
transparency initiatives such as the country-by-country 
reporting and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting from the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) and assesses frequently the impact of such 
initiatives. Where necessary or relevant, Flow Traders takes 
the appropriate actions to adopt these initiatives in its tax 
control framework. Further details on our tax policy can be 
found under Tax Principles on our website. The tax principles 
also serve as KPIs throughout the entire company’s 
performance measurement. The tax function within the 
company will therefore provide appropriate input as part of 
the approval process for business proposals to ensure 
a clear understanding of the tax consequences. We have 
good standing relationships with the tax authorities in each 
region in which we operate. We pro-actively manage our 
relationship with the tax authorities with the aim of 
minimizing the risk of challenge, dispute or damage that 
could have an impact on our credibility. We concluded 
a horizontal supervision agreement with the Dutch Tax 
Authority (horizontaal toezicht) with a view to further 
strengthening our transparent and professional relationship 
with the tax authorities. Tax laws, rules and interpretations 
are continuously subject to a changing social view towards 
tax and we cannot be certain of continued benefit from 
certain tax regimes, such as the FSI Schemes in Singapore 
and innovation box regime in the Netherlands. The key 
participants in the Tax Control Framework are well 
established and include the Supervisory Board, Managing 
Board, Finance & Tax department, internal auditors and 
external auditors. They are able to assess and weigh the 
risks associated with the tax decision process for our 
business and stakeholders. 
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local tax legislation. We do not use tax 
haven jurisdictions for tax avoidance purposes and carry out 
our business through entities in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the company can operate its business in 
line with its belief that it is part of the corporate social 
responsibility duty to pay taxes where it operates. In addition 
to corporate income taxes, Flow Traders pays many other 
taxes, including but not limited to, payroll taxes and social 
security contributions on the wages of its employees, value 
added taxes and property taxes. All these taxes are 
a significant basis of funding governmental public services. 
It is our social responsibility to contribute through taxes in 
the regions we operate in. For more information on our tax 
position, please refer to note 13 of the financial statements.

Environmental footprint
Many of our employees live reasonably close to our offices, 
limiting travel. No employee is offered a lease-car. We seek 
to limit our energy use and CO2 emissions to take care of our 
environment. When refurbishing our offices we sought to 
use more environmentally friendly solutions for lighting and 
water consumption. We are continuously looking for 
solutions to reduce the use of single-use plastic, currently 
phasing out single-use water bottles. This limits plastic 
waste significantly. We regularly review opportunities to 
compensate or limit our footprint, for instance by applying

IMC Basis
In 2018, we started working together with IMC Basis, 
a non-profit initiative that helps children from 
disadvantaged backgrounds to broaden their perspectives 
on educational and professional possibilities. The initiative is 
part of IMC Weekendschool, but different in the sense that 
NewTechKids Foundation EU Codeweek 2018
This non-profit foundation is focused on developing high 
quality education, lesson plans, teaching materials and 
effective training programs for primary school teachers, as it 
believes that computer science and computational-thinking 
education at the primary school level is still in its infancy. 
One of the initiatives of the NewTechKids foundation that 
Flow Traders sponsored was the ‘Rising Technologists Road 
Show’ in Amsterdam Zuidoost. During this week, the 
greener alternatives and carrying out annual energy audits 
in order to assess and reduce our impact on our 
environment. With this approach, we intend to contribute to 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13, 
Climate action.
We offer a full lunch to all our employees, healthy and free 
of charge. We make sure to limit our food waste as much as 
possible by responsible purchasing of ingredients and 
making sure leftovers are consumed the next day.
Societal commitment and charity
It is important for us to back initiatives that contribute to 
society. We support a number of charities, not only 
financially but also by offering access to the knowledge and 
experience that we have available. Our people are 
enthusiastic about supporting charitable initiatives, which 
has always been part of our working culture. We engage in 
the community giving throughout the year, and across our 
offices. We do this by supporting Flow Traders employees in 
fundraising activities by giving time or access to our network, 
by providing guidance to help them have as large an impact 
as possible, and by contributing financially. 
Next to the individual initiatives of our employees to 
contribute to society, we have chosen to focus our 2018 
investment in the areas of children’s education and sports. 
We believe children should have the ability to learn, get 
a quality education (which is the fourth goal on the list of 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals) and to be 
able to play sports. The initiatives we support include:

sustainable development.
Life Skills & Clinic - Ajax Foundation
This initiative focuses on primary schools in low-income 
areas in Amsterdam. The children receive different 
workshops about nutrition, and how to deal with money and 
social media. Furthermore, the children also participate in 
a football clinic, based on the unique training method that 
Ajax uses. In addition to the technical aspects of playing 
soccer, the children learn how to treat each other with 
respect, having fun, discipline and sportsmanship. 
different industries will make up a program of four weeks, 
during which professionals will give workshops and 
presentations at the school. There will often be a school 
outing to the company where the professional works at, for 
example to a national newspaper or a hospital. 
On 25 April 2018, we organized a Workshop day at Flow 
Traders. In addition to an introduction from Co-CEO Dennis 
Dijkstra, we organized different types of workshops on 
topics such as vocational testing, trading, sports and 
facilities. 
The support we provide to both NewTechKids Foundation EU 
Codeweek 2018 and IMC Basis falls within the scope of 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4, on the 
we actually adopt a primary school that is located close to 
the office. The school that we have adopted for three years 
is OBS de Waaier in Amsterdam Oost. 
The goal of IMC Basis is to prepare primary school children in 
groups 7 and 8 to make independent, motivated and 
responsible decisions when it comes to their education or 
profession. The target group is children who grew up in 
low-income areas. 
Together with IMC Basis, we have created a program, next to 
their regular educational program, that gives children the 
opportunity to explore different professions, such as 
journalism, architecture (they are going to design their own 
schoolyard), medicine, art and natural science. These

◾
In the fall of 2018, Flow Traders was a Bronze Level 
sponsor of the Wall Street Rides For Autism Research. 
This cycling event brings the financial community 
together to benefit the Autism Science Foundation, 
who are committed to funding research to look not only 
for possible causes but also better ways to treat autism 
and enhance the quality of life for those affected. 
Alongside the company support, seven employees 
participated and raised and donated additional funds. 
◾
◾
At the end of 2018, all employees, worldwide, were in 
the position of donating an amount of €1,000 to a 
charity of their choice instead of receiving a personal 
Christmas gift. As a result, more than 90 charitable 
organizations received donations. 
◾
◾
Our employees also take part in sports events to raise 
awareness and donations for a range of different 
charities.
Sporttop 
Our competitiveness and drive are part of our success, and 
the success of elite athletes. That is why we teamed-up with 
Sporttop, a foundation that links young, talented athletes to 
experienced Olympians and champions. These more 
experienced athletes mentor the talents, using their own 
experience, focusing on the mental mindset rather than the 
technical aspects of the sport. Together with Sporttop, we 
hosted a series of inspirational talks for our employees. 
Other organizations we sponsored in 2018:
◾
◾
Stichting Diabetes Onderzoek Nederland 2018
◾
◾
Sytske Foundation
◾
◾
Stichting steun Emma kinderziekenhuis AMC
◾
◾
And over 90 other charities
Individual employees have also initiated the backing of 
a growing number of charities, with the support of their 
colleagues and the company:
◾
◾
Flow Traders, together with its employees, supports the 
annual Sinterklaas toy drive whereby employees donate 
toys that their children no longer play with or new toys 
they purchase for the cause, or make a financial 
donation that the foundation uses to buy new toys. 
These toys are then distributed to children who live in, 
or close to, poverty. Supporting this charity is, on a local 
scale, contributing to the Reduction of Inequalities, 
as set out in the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals.
Dilemmas
In our daily activities we sometimes encounter dilemmas 
where we weigh our societal impact against business 
benefits. Being a listed company, we mostly find them at 
the intersection of regulations and entrepreneurship. 
Apart from having internal rules and regulations such as 
the Code of Conduct and the Whistleblower Policy, we try 
to assess and resolve these dilemmas by applying common 
sense and remaining aware of our role within society.
For example: while we seek profit by trading in a highly 
competitive environment, we feel that we must leverage 
our knowledge and our position as a market participant to 
safeguard fair, orderly and transparent markets for others. 
More specifically, we see purpose in protecting retail 
investor interests in these markets. Therefore, we spend 
considerable resources and efforts to address such 
outside interests in our regulatory dialogue as it improves 
market quality for everyone, including more vulnerable 
participants.

Flow Traders’ Risk Management Framework 
(RMF) forms the foundation of our approach to 
managing risks. The framework is documented in 
Flow Traders’ Risk Management Policy and is 
reviewed annually by our Management Board.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify and 
document possible risks which are inherent to trading in an 
automated environment. In the very dynamic environment 
of automated trading we designed our RMF in such a way 
that it is robust, efficient and transparent. In the figure 
below we summarize our stakeholders to which we are 
obliged to deliver such a framework.
The RMF helps us to ensure sufficient internal control and 
(internal) capital through a consistent, continuous and 
careful method for addressing, managing and prioritizing 
our key risks in the context of our enterprise-wide strategic 
objectives.

Risk category
Context
STRATEGIC RISKS
Business and Strategic 
risk
This concerns risk related to our strategy, business model and market conditions. Market activity risk is 
part of this risk as our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of the level of trading activity, or 
trading volumes, in the financial instruments in which we trade.
Compliance and 
regulatory risk
Compliance risk is the threat posed to a company’s earnings or capital as a result of violation or 
non-conformance with laws, regulations, or prescribed practices. It also concerns the risk of changing 
laws and regulations (regulatory risk).
In addition, it includes the risk that the integrity of the organization or its operations is jeopardized as a 
result of unethical behavior of the organization, its staff members or management.
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or 
products. Concentration risk also includes supplier dependency risks.
Legal risk
The legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from a claim, failure to adhere to legally binding agreements 
and requirements, or failure to adequately legally protect assets of the firm.
Reputation risk
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders. 
OPERATIONAL RISKS
IT risk
The IT risk concerns the risk of loss resulting from inadequate information technology and processing in 
terms of availability, manageability, integrity, controllability and continuity, insufficient protection, or 
inadequate IT strategy and policy or inadequate use.
IT security risk
This concerns risks relating to access management, cybersecurity and data integrity risks.
Operational risk
The operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people 
or from external events. The main driver of operational risk is human error.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that there is not sufficient trading capital or regulatory capital available. 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market prices; in particular, changes 
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in trading in or issuing a financial 
instrument defaulting on an obligation.
Enterprise Risk Management
We aim for a good balance between our business activities, 
return on capital and related risks. Flow Traders’ Risk 
Management adopts its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
approach to ensure that our risk appetite and profile are 
integrated in our day-to-day operations and strategic, 
tactical and operational objective setting and decision 
making. 
Our ERM activities follow the annual cycle. Every year our 
Management Board sets its business targets following the 
strategic goals. Based on the targets and objectives, the 
Management Board formulates its risk appetite. The targets, 
objectives and risk appetite give direction to the various 
departments within the company and are used to derive our 
strategic risks. 
We implement our Risk Management cycle to ensure that 
the residual risk profile is (and remains) in line with the set 
risk appetite. To achieve this, we perform risk (self-) 
assessments (RSA) to identify and assess current and newly 
arisen risks. Following the RSAs, the Management Board 
decides on the appropriate risk response.
Risk categories
We identify three general risk categories - Strategic risks, 
Operational risks and Financial risks - each with their own 
specific risks areas:

Risk Management Governance 
The effectiveness of risk management is unavoidably linked 
to commitment and integrity. It is therefore crucial that the 
Management Board, global and local department heads, 
and all Flow Traders employees are aware of the company’s 
risk exposure and their own responsibilities, as well as the 
responsibilities of Flow Traders as a whole.
Our risk management is embedded in the organization in line 
with the three lines of defense model.
The first line of defense is formed by Trading and 
Technology. These two departments are crucial for the core 
processes within Flow Traders and are responsible for 
incorporating preventive and detective controls in the 
day-to-day trading and IT processes and for the continuous 
monitoring of our systems and trading controls.
The second line of defense is responsible for oversight and 
monitoring regarding risks, rules and requirements. 
Risk Management, Mid-Office and Trading Compliance 
monitor and manage most of the preventive controls, 
Regulatory Compliance and Finance monitor and manage 
primarily detective controls. Together, they are responsible 
for the continuous risk management of Flow Traders.
The third line of defense is formed by our Internal Audit 
department. In addition, we have an external auditor and we 
are audited by regulators.

Every year the Management Board sets its business targets 
following the strategic goals. The strategic goals are 
generally formulated in November/December. 
The Supervisory Board, together with the Management 
Board, approves the strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Supervisory Board is part of the strategy 
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are then 
translated into annual companywide, departmental and 
individual goals and discussed in an annual meeting with the 
Management Board and all Managing Directors.
Based on the targets and objectives, the Management Board 
formulates the risk appetite of the company.
The targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to the 
various departments within Flow Traders and are used to 
derive the company’s strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management cycle is implemented to 
ensure that the net risk profile is and stays in line with the 
set risk appetite. To do so, we perform RSAs to identify and 
assess current and newly arisen risks and compliance with 
applicable requirements. Following the RSAs, department 
heads in cooperation with the Management Board will 
decide on the appropriate risk response. The effects of the 
chosen risk responses will be monitored and every year the 
actual net risk profile will be mapped versus the appetite.
Risk reporting
We have a standing risk committee that continuously 
assesses the risks we face in our business, comprised of our 
Global Head of Risk and Mid-Office and the Management 
Board. Aside from ongoing ad-hoc communication, there is 
a recurring meeting set up in which they discuss all risk 
assessments and risk proposals related to position limits,

To cope with periods of little market activity, we diversify in 
products and markets traded. This is to safeguard that we 
are not too dependent on the levels of market activity in 
one asset class or product category. 
Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or 
external events. Operational risk management is an integral 
part of Flow Traders’ management information and control 
systems. As our operational risks are concentrated in 
technology events at exchanges and clearing members, our 
investment in technology is important to mitigate those 
associated risks. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, 
high-performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new hardware 
and software. Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement improvements in 
both hardware and software on an ongoing basis. Controlled 
releases of hardware and software enhancements provide 
for minimal disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or updates 
of our trading software) is being developed is strictly 
separated from the environment in which such trading 
software operates in production. Access to the source code 
is strictly controlled and limited. Prior to releasing our 
trading software, or an update into the production 
environment, any element of our trading software is 
subjected to a review of its code, testing in an environment 
that is separate from our production environment, validation 
in limited production (processing a strictly limited number of 
trades) on one trading desk in respect of trading a single 
committees of the Supervisory Board are monitored in the 
Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. This means that 
the relevant items set out in best practice provision 1.4.1 of 
the Corporate Governance Code have been discussed by the 
Supervisory Board, as all members of the Supervisory Board 
are members of the Risk Committee. For more information, 
please refer to the chapter Supervisory Board Report.
Key risks
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from unfavorable 
market movements, such as prices, when positions in 
financial instruments are held. The value of a financial 
instrument may fluctuate because of changes in factors 
such as equity prices, currency rates, future dividend 
expectations, interest rates and volatilities. Our hedging 
strategies, in combination with the use of straightforward 
products and continuous monitoring, aim to minimize this 
risk. Our trading philosophy is that we hedge our positions as 
perfectly as possible and therefore we minimalize exposures 
towards market. 
Market activity risk (business risk)
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of the level 
of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial 
instruments in which we trade, and the bid-ask spreads 
(which largely determine the profit on the trade, or margins, 
we capture). Trading volumes in securities, derivatives and 
other financial instruments on exchanges and in other 
trading venues worldwide are directly affected by factors 
beyond our control, including economic and political 
conditions, broad trends in business and finance, regulatory 
requirements, actions by central banks, and changes in the 
markets in which such transactions occur.
strategies, procedures, capital requirements and other 
requirements of prime brokers and market developments. 
Any major changes to our risk systems, strategies and limit 
setting must subsequently be approved by the Management 
Board. In 2018 there have not been any major failings in the 
internal risk management and control systems observed 
during 2018. Additionally, improvements to the systems are 
discussed with the Management Board.
In addition to the standing risk committee, the company has 
a Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. All members of 
the Supervisory Board are members of this Risk Committee. 
The Management Board informs the Risk Committee of the 
Supervisory Board about the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems. This includes the 
reasonable assurance that the aforementioned systems do 
not contain any material inaccuracies. In addition, the tasks 
of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board includes 
supervision and monitoring, as well as advising the 
Management Board on the operation of the company’s 
internal risk management and control systems. The Risk 
Committee is also responsible for providing advice to the 
Management Board on the company’s development, 
performance, and sustainability of its trading strategies, as 
well as reviewing the risk of the company. It maintains 
regular contact with the company’s Trading and Risk and 
Mid-Office departments. For more information on the 
responsibilities of our Risk Committee, please see the 
chapter Our Governance.
Following a review of the company’s risk assessment 
processes, the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems has been identified as 
a priority and as a joint responsibility of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees. All risks relevant to each of the

Our Regulatory Compliance department assists 
management and operations at group and local level by 
identifying, advising on, reviewing and reporting on 
regulations. It also seeks to maintain a compliant business 
environment through training and monitoring in order to 
ensure and enhance the group’s conformance with its 
regulatory obligations. 
The Trading Compliance and Risk and Mid-Office 
departments have promulgated and implemented 
pre-trade risk controls, internal rules and regulations that 
were developed following regulatory requirements, 
guidelines from market authorities, industry best practices 
and our own best practices.
Laws and regulations, including tax laws, are subject to 
change or can be interpreted differently in practice over 
time. Currently, the European Commission, European 
Parliament and European member states are negotiating 
new capital and remuneration requirements (IFR/IFD) which 
may affect our Dutch trading entity and our Group. 
We expect more certainty about the outcome in the next 
few months. Meanwhile, the remuneration rules in the 
Netherlands are in the process of being reviewed. We cannot 
predict the outcome of such regulatory developments and 
are closely following relevant developments.
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements could adversely affect our 
reputation, profitability and prospects. This may also be the 
case for differences in interpretation or lack of timely or 
complete implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, disgorgements and 
censures, suspension or expulsion from trading venues or 
the revocation or limitation of licenses. We aim to minimize 
such risks by focusing considerable management attention, 
instance, provides that each office acts as a back-up site for 
other offices.
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we 
commence trading on new platforms, including platforms 
designated for trading digital assets. While many of such 
platforms remain unregulated, many have strongly 
improved their own onboarding procedures and CID 
procedures. While we believe our own procedures are strong 
and trading on such platforms is quite limited, the 
unregulated status of such platforms and their location in 
emerging economies makes them inherently less 
institutionalized and supervised than regulated platforms in 
developed economies.
Regulatory risk
While we do not have clients and do not provide investment 
services or ancillary services to third parties, our markets 
and nearly all aspects of our business are heavily regulated. 
Where applicable, entities forming part of our group have 
obtained the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses. 
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in four 
international jurisdictions and in addition we have opened 
a branch office in London. As a group we currently trade on 
more than 161 venues worldwide. In addition, we operate on 
various venues through brokers. As we have to comply with 
our home regulations, local regulations and trading rules of 
all venues on which we trade, our regulatory landscape is 
vast. Legislators and regulators worldwide strengthen their 
supervision within our environment, demanding 
a professional and well-structured compliance organization.
financial instrument, followed by more extensive testing 
across multiple desks and/or trading multiple financial 
instruments. Each step, and progressive steps, is 
documented. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control undisrupted 
trading activities in real time. Multilayer monitoring is 
employed to avoid errors, but when these occur the relevant 
teams are notified via multiple notification channels. We rely 
on multiple third party service providers for business and 
market data. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with our 
trading platform, analyzing real-time pricing data, and is 
designed to ensure that our order activity is conducted 
within strict pre-determined trading and position limits. 
For example, our pre-trade risk controls are designed to 
prevent the trading engines from sending quotes which 
deviate from our pre-defined risk parameters, such as price 
and volume limits set by the Risk Management department, 
which keeps our ordering, trading and positions well within 
tolerance levels. Our monitoring tools reconcile trades, 
prices and positions against those of our exchanges and 
prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration tests 
by external experts. We have a comprehensive IT security 
system that is designed to protect us from attacks both 
from inside and outside the platform. Where we have 
a technical interface with institutions like our prime brokers 
and exchanges, the integrity of the connection between the 
systems and the data that is being exchanged is subject to 
prior conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, for

a member of FIA Asia. These are industry groups that consist 
of leading principal trading firms. We are also a member of 
the Dutch Association of Proprietary Traders (APT), 
operating as an industry body of Netherlands-based 
liquidity providers. As part of these important groups, we 
continue to promote, foremost, the principle that all 
markets and market participants should be adequately and 
transparently regulated. Within these groups we contribute 
to discussions regarding current and new regulations, 
including IFR/IFD, CRD IV/CRR, MiFID II, Brexit, market 
structure and market regulations. We will continue to 
contribute to these discussions and will persist in maximizing 
transparency in respect of our industry, its benefits for all 
market participants and fair, orderly and transparent 
financial markets.
Going concern
Flow Traders, having made appropriate enquiries, consider 
that adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, 
therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the 2018 financial statements. In reaching these 
conclusions, the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 
2018 and the strong free cash flow of the Group, the Group’s 
ability to access capital markets and the principal risks 
facing the Group are taken into consideration. 
A commentary on the Group’s cash flows, financial position 
and liquidity for the year ended 31 December 2018 is set out 
on pages 79 to 115. The Group’s capital position is strong and 
therefore the Management Board believes that Flow Traders 
is well prepared for the future.

Principal Traders Association (FIA EPTA), a member of the

The aggregate capital that the prime brokers require is 
significantly higher than their risk exposure. For example, we 
may clear two legs of one transaction through two different 
prime brokers. Even when the transaction is fully hedged 
(the risk is fully offset), each prime broker will still require 
capital for such position as if the risk is not being offset. 
The prime brokers cannot establish that the other prime 
broker has an offsetting position so they will charge a full 
capital requirement. This increases the capital they require 
us to maintain beyond what would be necessary. In addition, 
margin requirements of prime brokers are conservatively 
determined by the sophistication of their models and the 
regulatory requirements, which might not necessarily be 
efficient in respect of our business model and trading 
portfolios.
The following table sets out the capital required to be

Capital management
The Management Board’s policy is to maintain a strong 
capital base well above the required margins in order to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. 
The Management Board monitors the return on capital as 
well as the level of dividends to shareholders while 
complying with prime broker and regulatory capital 
requirements.
The available capital in the trading companies is monitored 
on a daily basis to ensure that requirements are met at all 
times and sufficient capital is available to support the 
Group’s strategy.
Capital requirements
The Group needs to comply with capital requirements from 
its prime brokers, as well as regulatory capital requirements. 
Capital is being managed by the Group in order to maintain 
net liquidity (which represents the value of our trading 
positions, principally long and short positions in equity 
securities, plus cash and cash equivalents) in excess of our 
various capital requirements at all times, while 
simultaneously exceed the regulatory capital requirements.
Prime broker capital requirements
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain certain 
minimum capital levels. Prime brokers use various internal 
systems to calculate required capital amounts (e.g., the 
‘internal haircut model’ and the ‘margin based approach 
model’, both intending to ensure sufficient levels of risk 
allowances) and have different limits structure, pre-funding 
possibilities and cut-off times for wiring capital.

losses these variable compensation elements are reduced 
or forfeited entirely to cover for such loss. Although this is 
an important additional capital buffer, this is not reflected in 
the regulatory capital calculations above. 
Our Pillar III disclosures pursuant to CRR can be requested 
through our website www.flowtraders.com at of around the 
time the Financial Statements of our Dutch trading entity, 
Flow Traders B.V., have been approved and published, which 
is expected to be within the next months. 
Management and control
Our global capital position is managed on a daily and 
intra-day level by the Risk and Mid-Office department. 
The Risk and Mid Office department checks our positions 
and capital posted at every prime broker for correctness and 
compares these numbers with the relevant prime broker or 
regulatory requirements. Separately, the Finance 
department prepares a rolling 15-month forecast for our 
capital positions, every month. 
As part of our regulatory capital management cycle, the Risk 
and Mid-Office departments daily prepares a report that 
shows all the group’s positions and capital versus the CRR 
capital requirements. At the end of every quarter the 
company and Flow Traders B.V. report their capital 
requirements and corresponding coverage to the Dutch 
Central Bank. 
A final part of the internal risk management and capital 
cycle is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process. The ICAAP comprises a review of prevalent risks, 
the capital management processes, the risk management 
Dutch Central Bank in respect of Flow Traders B.V. and the 
company. The regulatory capital requirement consists of the 
requirements calculated under CRR, reflecting an 8 percent 
charge over risk weighted assets, and a Capital Conservation 
buffer of 1.875 percent, totalling 9.875 percent during 2018. 
The Capital Conservation buffer will further increase to 2.5 
percent as per 1 January 2019 resulting in a total CRR 
requirement of 10.5 percent. The following graph sets out 
regulatory capital available, regulatory capital requirements 
and excess regulatory capital for Flow Traders N.V. 
as reported in regulatory filings as of the dates indicated:
All available capital is CET1, the quality highest capital, 
reflecting equity and retained earnings. In addition, as set 
out in chapter Remuneration, part of our variable 
remuneration is fully discretionary and deferred over 
Regulatory capital requirements
The company and our subsidiary Flow Traders B.V. 
are subject to separate regulatory capital requirements in 
the Netherlands and our subsidiary Flow Traders U.S. LLC is 
subject to regulatory capital requirements in the United 
States. Flow Traders Asia Pte. Ltd. is exempt from regulatory 
capital requirements and Flow Traders Hong Kong Limited 
has a capital requirement in Hong Kong. Failure to comply 
with regulatory capital requirements could result in 
sanctions, including citations, fines, limits to our trading and 
revocation of a regulatory license. 
Starting 31 March 2018 the company meets the regulatory 
requirements of the EU Capital Requirement Regulation

Message of the Chairman
Over the course of 2018 the Supervisory Board focused on 
a range of topics that will help the company realize its 
ambitions, maintain its distinctive culture and create 
long-term value. These included the impact of the EU 
Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the company’s 
growth strategy, succession planning for both the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board, risks related 
to expansion into new markets and the company’s financial 
results. 
Message of the Supervisory Board
Company developments
The company had a strong year, taking advantage of periods 
of elevated volatility, while successfully embedding 
initiatives that were introduced in 2017. Flow Traders 
continued to increase the number of venues it is connected 
to and the products it provides liquidity in, including 
expanding into fixed income. At the same time, the company 
opened a branch office in London to further develop its 
position in the UK market, and received its local license in 
Hong Kong. 
A review of 2018
During the year, the Supervisory Board discussed a range of 
topics at its regular meetings and within its four committees: 
The Audit Committee, Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, Trading & Technology Committee, and the Risk 
Committee.
The company’s strategy, which focuses on long-term value 
creation, was discussed at Supervisory Board meetings 
throughout the year. These discussions included the 
supervision of the strategy’s implementation, as well as the 
impact and management of any risks related to it. 
Regulatory changes were deliberated and monitored during 
the Supervisory Board’s regular meetings. These included 
MiFID II, which the company successfully implemented in 
2018, and which is aimed at creating greater financial 
stability and transparency. The Supervisory Board also 
supervised the company’s compliance with CRR, which took 
place well before the 31 March 2018 deadline and confirms 
the company’s solid capital base. Over the course of the year

the Supervisory Board also monitored the development of 
the company’s expansion into Fixed Income and discussed 
the importance of machine learning to help the company 
improve its trading models and reduce risk. 
During its regular meetings, the Supervisory Board discussed 
succession planning for both the Management Board and 
the Supervisory Board. This included the expansion of the 
Management Board with the introduction of Folkert Joling as 
Chief Trading Officer and Thomas Wolff as Chief Technology 
Officer, as well as Co-CEO Sjoerd Rietberg’s decision not to 
opt for reappointment in 2019 and the departure of Chief 
Financial Officer Marcel Jongmans. The Supervisory Board 
believes that officially representing technology and trading 
at Management Board level will help strengthen the 
company as it continues to implement its organic growth 
strategy. 
The company’s internal culture remains one of its key 
strengths, and the Supervisory Board continued to focus on 
how best to preserve this culture to support current and 
new employees. During the year, the company carried out 
a survey to better understand how employees feel about 
Flow Traders, whether they recognize and can relate to the 
culture, and if they feel they have the opportunity to 
express themselves and grow internally. The Supervisory 
Board discussed the survey’s outcomes, and concluded that 
ensuring that employees feel connected to the current 
culture is vital to our future prospects. 
Looking ahead
As 2019 progresses, the Supervisory Board will continue to 
monitor the progression of the company’s strategy, its risk 
profile and any new regulatory developments, such as the 
EU Investment Firm Regulation (IFR) and accompanying EU 
Investment Firm Directive (IFD). The Supervisory Board will 
continue to evaluate the composition and functioning of the 
Management Board and oversee succession planning. 
Regards, 
Eric Drok
Chairman of the Supervisory Board
‘The company had 
a strong year, 
taking advantage 
of periods of 
elevated volatility, 
while successfully 
embedding 
initiatives that 
were introduced  
in 2017’

◾
Culture
Culture has always and will always form a very 
important role within Flow Traders. Culture has been 
regularly discussed during the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee and the Supervisory Board 
meetings. During 2018, specific attention was paid to 
the Whistleblower Policy and the awareness of 
employees of Flow Traders of the Whistleblower Policy. 
Trainings on the Whistleblower Policy were given to all 
employees. The company’s Code of Conduct was also 
discussed during the year.
◾
◾
New legislation and regulation
The Supervisory Board regularly discussed upcoming 
regulation, and new regulation that has to be 
implemented. This includes the revision of the 
European capital and remuneration requirements set 
out in the Investment Firm Regulation and Investment 
Firm Directive, which are currently being developed by 
EU legislators and govern new capital and remuneration 
requirements. The Supervisory Board also discussed 
the implementation of MiFID II and the impact on the 
market structure, and the company in particular. 
The Supervisory Board was also updated on 
developments regarding GDPR and remuneration 
requirements.
◾
◾
Financial results
The Supervisory Board was updated on the company’s 
financial, legal and compliance risks through the Audit 
Committee and the Risk Committee. Other topics

internal controls in place to address these risks, and the 
Management Board’s views on such risks. 
◾
◾
Capital Requirements
On 13 November 2017 the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) 
informed Flow Traders about its decision to amend 
capital requirements for investment firms dealing on 
own account. This also applied to Flow Traders, as of the 
first reporting date (31 March 2018). Progress in 
implementing the specific capital requirements was 
discussed during Supervisory Board meetings.
◾
◾
Brexit contingency planning
The Supervisory Board regularly discussed Brexit and 
the consequences of it, as well as implementing 
contingency measures at Flow Traders. 
◾
◾
Succession planning and diversity
The terms of three Supervisory Board members expired 
in 2018. The terms of three other Supervisory Board 
members will expire in 2019, hence succession planning 
of the Supervisory Board formed an important topic of 
discussion during the Supervisory Board and 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee meetings. 
In light of the expiring term of Dennis Dijkstra and in 
view of the press release dated 13 September 2018 
announcing Sjoerd Rietberg is not opting for 
reappointment in 2019 and the resignation of Marcel 
Jongmans as Chief Financial Officer, effective 
8 December 2018, the succession planning of the 
Management Board was also discussed. 
When discussing succession planning, the company’s 
Equal Opportunity Policy is always taken into account.
Meetings of the Supervisory Board 
In 2018 the Supervisory Board members met eight times to 
hold formal Supervisory Board meetings and met several 
times without holding a formal Supervisory Board meeting. 
Examples of meetings without holding a formal meeting 
include a preparation session for the AGM, education and 
strategy days and the self-assessment day. During these 
meetings a number of topics, including the following, were 
discussed:
◾
◾
The company’s strategy 
The company’s Management Board focuses on the 
long-term value creation of the company and has 
involved the Supervisory Board in translating this 
long-term value creation into the company’s strategy. 
The Supervisory Board regularly discusses the strategy, 
the implementation of the strategy, and any associated 
risks. In September 2018, the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board went off-site to comprehensively 
discuss the company’s strategy and related long-term 
value creation. The Supervisory Board agreed on 
financial and non-financial KPIs of the Management 
Board, these KPIs are further explained in the chapter 
Remuneration.
◾
◾
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the company’s risk assessment processes 
and the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems remain a priority and 
joint responsibility of the Supervisory Board and all 
committees. The assessment comprises an overview of

Evaluation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of the 
self-assessment of 2017, and the follow-up on conclusions 
of that self-assessment. As a result of the conclusions of 
the 2017 assessment, amongst other things this year a joint 
strategy offsite was organized for the Supervisory Board 
and the Management Board. 
 
In 2018 the Supervisory Board also reviewed its own 
performance using a combination of an electronic survey 
and a group discussion. Using the same questionnaire year 
over year enabled comparisons with last year’s results. 
Compared to 2017, the Supervisory Board concluded that its 
overall functioning has improved. Specific items for follow 
up that arose this year included continued focus on strategy, 
the composition of the Supervisory Board and in-depth 
knowledge of the business of Flow Traders and its 
regulatory environment. Other positions of Supervisory 
Board members were also reviewed as part of the 
self-assessment.
The Supervisory Board’s self-assessment includes an 
independence-assessment. The independence assessment

Evaluation of the Management Board 
The performance of the Management Board is discussed at 
least two times a year between two Supervisory Board 
members. During performance discussions, the 
representatives speak with the Management Board 
members individually and with the Management Board as 
a whole. Guiding structures for these conversations include 
the Management Board KPI overview and the strategic 
project goals set for 2018. Based on these discussions the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee provides 
feedback regarding its view on the Management Board’s 
performance to the Supervisory Board, to guide year-end 
discussions on variable rewards.

Profile of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board Profile provides that the 
qualifications of a particular candidate and fit with the 
company’s needs shall always prevail when filling a position. 
When selecting members, the Supervisory Board aims for 
a balance in nationality, gender, age, experience, and active 
or retired backgrounds. In addition, balance in the 
experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the 
business of the company will be sought. The Supervisory 
Board strives to realize a diverse composition in the 
nomination and appointment process for vacancies, while 
taking into account the overall profile and selection criteria 
for appointments of suitable candidates to the Supervisory 
Board. As such, diversity, including gender-related, is an 
important consideration in the selection process for the (re)
appointment of Supervisory Board members. 
The Supervisory Board Profile can be found on our website: 
www.flowtraders.com.
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
The company has an Equal Opportunity Policy in place. 
In this policy we explain our objective to treat everyone 
equally during the hiring process and throughout their 
careers at Flow Traders. We are committed to being a truly 
equal opportunity employer, by recruiting, retaining and 
promoting people based on merit, and merit alone. We are 
a firm believer in the benefits of a diverse workplace and we 
do not make any concessions to quality. Our objective is to 
provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all of our 
employees, provided they perform highly. When positions 
become available, we actively encourage all candidates to 
apply and ensure that the selection and retention processes 
are truly equal for all applicants and employees. This also 
holds for our Management Board and Supervisory Board. 
When it comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, we adhere to the same principles of 
equal opportunity as set out above. As a result, our current 
Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
education, nationality, and professional backgrounds. 
Our Equal Opportunity Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
Succession planning
In 2018, Thomas Wolff and Folkert Joling were appointed as 
Management Board members. As announced in the press 
release, dated 13 September 2018, Sjoerd Rietberg has taken 
the decision not to opt for reappointment as Management 
Board member and Co-CEO in 2019. In the company’s press 
release issued on 7 December 2018, it was announced that 
Dennis Dijkstra is proposed for reappointment as sole CEO 
of Flow Traders N.V. at the upcoming AGM in 2019 and that 
Marcel Jongmans has resigned as Management Board 
member and CFO. The full size and composition of the 
Management Board was discussed regularly during 2018. 
Our Equal Opportunity Policy was an important topic during 
these discussions. Han Sikkens, Rudolf Ferscha and Jan van 
Kuijk were reappointed as member of the Supervisory Board 
in 2018. The figure below shows the terms of (re)
appointment for all Supervisory Board members. The Equal 
Opportunity Policy was taken into account regarding the 
appointments of the two Management Board members and 
the reappointments of the Supervisory Board members.
Independence of the Supervisory Board
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is not a former 
member of the company’s Management Board and is 
independent within the meaning of best practice provision 
2.1.8 of the Corporate Governance Code. Jan van Kuijk and 
Roger Hodenius do not qualify as independent under the 
provisions of the Corporate Governance Code as they, as our 
founders, are former members of the company’s 
Management Board and represent shareholders of the 
company, Han Sikkens is considered an independent 
Supervisory Board member as of 2017.
Committees
The Supervisory Board has four committees: the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, 
the Trading & Technology Committee, and the Risk 
Committee. Each committee has a preparatory and/or 
advisory role to the Supervisory Board and reports to the 
Supervisory Board rotation schedule

unqualified interim review report, their audit plan for the 
financial year 2018 and recommendations on the basis of the 
annual report and the financial statements over the financial 
year 2017. The Audit Committee reviewed the management 
letter and recommendations included in the auditor’s 
report, as issued by the external auditor and discussed the 
actions taken by management to address any 
recommendations and observations. The Audit Committee 
evaluates the performance of the external auditor and 
discusses this with the Supervisory Board and subsequently 
with the external auditor. In light of this, the Audit 
Committee advises the Supervisory Board about the 
reappointment of the external auditor, before the 
Supervisory Board determines its nomination for the 
appointment of the external auditor to the General Meeting. 
Given the nature of our business, the application of

during the year.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met three times in 2018, with each 
meeting fully attended. Invitees of the meeting were the 
Management Board members, the Head of Risk and relevant 
others. The main focus in the meetings was the

risks, the Management Board’s views on such risks, as well 
as the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
internal risk management and control system. 
The committee has discussed the way material risks and 
uncertainties have been analyzed and discussed, and the 
Capital Requirement Regulation was also a topic of 
discussion. More information can be found in the chapter 
Our Risk Management. 
Financial statements and dividend
The 2018 financial statements were prepared by the 
Management Board. They were discussed both with the 
Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, in attendance 
of EY. The financial statements were audited by EY, who 
issued an unqualified auditor’s report. Reference is made to 
the auditor’s report on page 117 of the financial statements. 
The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements as 
audited by EY, including the company’s dividend proposal. 
We invite the General Meeting to:
Remuneration & Appointment Committee
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee met four 
times in 2018. All meetings were fully attended. Other 
attendees to the meetings included the Management Board 
and the Global Head of HRM & Recruitment. During the 
meetings the Remuneration & Appointment Committee 
discussed the company’s culture in general, the General 
Remuneration Policy, the Equal Opportunity Policy, and 
drafted proposals to the Supervisory Board for the 
remuneration practices to be pursued for the Management 
Board and staff of the company. It also outlined proposals 
for the remuneration of the individual members of the 
Management Board for adoption by the Supervisory Board. 
The size, composition and functioning of the Supervisory 
Board and Management Board was reviewed and findings 
reported to the Supervisory Board. Other duties included 
the monitoring of developments of the Corporate 
Governance Code and regulations in relation to 
remuneration policies and the preparation of the 
Remuneration Report. 
Before determining the remuneration of the Management 
Board members, the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee took note of the individual Management Board 
members’ views with regard to the amount and structure of 
their own remuneration.
Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee met three times in 
2018, with each meeting fully attended. As the core business 
of the company is discussed in this committee, all of the 
Supervisory Board members are members of the Trading & 
Technology Committee. The committee addresses trading 
topics such as, but not limited to, the general market 
conditions, the (relative) performance of the trading desks 
External auditor
The Audit Committee and the Management Board reported 
to the Supervisory Board on EY’s functioning as the external 
auditor, the company’s relationship with the external 
auditor, on its fees, as well as on other audit and non-audit 
services it provided to the company. EY performed a review 
of the company’s interim financial statements and issued an 
unqualified review report. The Audit Committee evaluated 
the qualifications, performance and independence of EY, 
taking into account the opinions of the Management Board. 
The Audit Committee also obtained a report from the 
external auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. EY confirmed its independence 
from Flow Traders in accordance with the professional 
standards applicable to it. EY’s lead audit partner was 
present at all of the Audit Committee meetings held in 2018. 
Based on the information provided by the Audit Committee, 
the Supervisory Board nominated EY as external auditor at 
the company’s General Meeting in 2018. Subsequently, EY 
was reappointed by the General Meeting as external auditor 
for the financial year 2018.
Internal audit function 
The Internal Audit Function (IAF) executed audits that form 
part of the internal audit plan, approved by the Supervisory 
Board. Focus areas in this audit plan included the resilience 
of our trading systems, transparency, corporate governance, 
third parties, contracts, finance and capital requirements. 
The IAF performed a number of specific reviews at the 
request of the Management Board and the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee and the Global Head of 
Internal Audit discussed the audit results (findings, 
observations, recommendations, management feedback 
and follow-up). The Audit Committee maintains regular 
dialogue with the IAF. More information can be found in the

our business activities and the compensation structure of 
the Management Board, the Supervisory Board tracks the 
actual performance of the Management Board members 
and eligibility for variable remuneration throughout the year, 
with half-yearly discussions taking place to facilitate this. 
Please see the section on Analyses carried out in respect of

In accordance with the global remuneration model in place 
for all employees, the members of the Management Board 
are entitled to annual variable compensation based on 
performance in respect of individual criteria and their 
contribution to the success of the company as whole. These 
criteria reflect quantitative and qualitative criteria related to 
non-financial performance. Variable remuneration, if 
awarded, is paid in cash in multiple instalments, providing 
a strong incentive for long-term value creation. Instalments 
may be reduced or clawed back under circumstances 
described in the Remuneration Act, Dutch corporate law and 
the Corporate Governance Code. Please see the section on 
the Remuneration of the members of the Management 
Board in the chapter Remuneration for a more detailed 
description. 
In 2018, the total average compensation of the individual 
Management Board members amounted to €2,476,336 
compared to the company-wide average compensation 
(excluding the Management Board) paid per employee of 
€251,700 resulting in a pay ratio of 10.9 (2017: 3.5). The pay 
ratio has changed significantly compared to last year. 
This can be explained by the company’s financial results as 
last year management’s variable compensation decreased 
significantly because of the company’s profitability in 2017. 
When making the same comparison of the Co-CEO 
compensation rather than the full Management Board 
compensation, the pay ratio would be 12.0 (2017: 3.5).
The average compensation of the Board Members is 
calculated by dividing the total of their fixed based salaries 
and variable remuneration by the number of FTEs (five). 
The company-wide average is calculated in similar fashion 
by adding up fixed salaries and variable remuneration and 
dividing by the number of FTEs (436). Due to the nature of

Remuneration report 
The General Remuneration Policy was approved and 
adopted in 2016 and has been reviewed by the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee from time to time 
to ensure it remains relevant and is suited to the size of our 
enterprise and the way it is organized, as well as the nature, 
scope and complexity of our business activities. 
The remuneration of the Management Board consists of 
a relatively modest fixed base salary and a variable 
compensation in cash. The awarding of variable 
remuneration to the members of the Management Board – 
as well as to all employees – is entirely dependent on the 
company’s profit in any given year. In that sense, our General 
Remuneration Policy works as a risk-mitigating tool and 
a self-correcting mechanism. If there is no profit, no variable 
remuneration will be awarded. If there is profit, variable 
remuneration is available for all employees and the 
Management Board. The net variable remuneration 
historically amounts to 36 percent of our operating result 
and the above-mentioned guidelines continue to apply 
going forward. If the company incurs a loss, deferred 
variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited entirely.

‘Machine learning is certain branches

Our job is to create algorithms that can be 
used to develop a mathematical model, 
and we then give this model a task to do. 
The goal is that the machine learning 
algorithm will ‘learn’ to do the task better 
and better, creating more accurate 
results.’ 
Is this new technology? 
‘It is only over the last ten years that we 
have had the computing power, the data 
and the ability to disprove certain 
theoretical issues associated with machine 
learning, which we were unable to in the 
past, that has led us to where we are 
today.’
What is a machine learning example that 
everyone will recognize?
‘The two best examples are self-driving 
cars and the automated ads on your 
smartphone. In self-driving cars, the 
machine learning algorithms process the 
huge amount of data that comes in from 
the car’s cameras, infrared sensors, 
gyroscopes, accelerometers, GPS 
receivers, and so on. They process this 
data to understand the car’s surrounding 
environment and they then suggest an 
action such as ‘steer 20 degrees left’. 
They learn as they progress, recognizing 
what works and what does not work.
Then we have online advertising 
algorithms, where everything you do on 
the web is being analyzed: Purchases, 
websites you visited, clicking behavior and 
so on. The data can be gathered by those 
infamous cookies, and this fuels machine 
learning methods to predict your behavior 
and to optimize their consumer-targeting 
strategy.’
How is machine learning affecting Flow 
Traders today?
‘We trade over ten thousand of products 
at Flow Traders, which means we deal with 
a huge amount of information. Add to that 
the fact that markets are becoming faster, 
with many millions of updates per day,  
and the result is we have to process an 
enormous amount of data. 
One of the ways we use machine learning 
algorithms is to analyze this avalanche of 
information. After we tell it what to do, it 
sets various parameters to come up with 
the best solution. 
For example, you have algorithms that 
predict future prices, provide advice on 
whether to buy or sell, as well as fully 
automated algorithms that manage the 
entire trading software.’

Name: Arnout Tilgenkamp 
Position: Head of Quantitative Research
Specialism: Machine learning
Background: Arnout has an MSc  
in Econometrics and Management Science from Erasmus 
University, Rotterdam. Prior to Flow Traders,  
he worked as a Quantitative (Equity) Analyst at ING 
Investment Management.
And how will it impact the company in the 
coming three to five years?
‘It will lead to greater automation, 
especially in trading and quantitative 
research. For example, many traders have 
programming in their skill set, and this is 
becoming the new norm. In a few years I 
think it will be strange if you come across 
newly joining traders who don’t have such 
skills. In terms of how the models are 
built, I think at Flow Traders an 
ever-important aspect will be the risk 
associated with automated trading.’ 
What interests you about machine learning?
‘I love two things: automation, where I can 
create a system that works. And I love it 
when that system beats humans. 
For example, when I play games I look for 
ways to optimize processes and create 
a system that will win. Like many people in 
my field, I’m driven by using quantitative 
methods to solve problems and create 
answers.’ 
Looking beyond five years, what future do 
you see for machine learning?
‘While I think there will be greater use of 
machine learning across society, how 
much it is used will depend on how much 
control people are willing to give up to 
machines. People have a tendency to 
retain control, and that’s a behavioral bias 
we will have to let go of. But I think we’ll 
see more autonomous car driving, and 
probably far more applications in places 
where it is not always obvious: in 
advertising, grocery shopping, your 
communications, buying tickets for 
concerts and so on. It is here to stay.’

Remuneration
We want to attract and retain the best talent 
available. We believe that awarding an attractive 
and competitive remuneration package is an 
important part of our proposition to candidates 
and employees. Therefore, we offer our 
employees a combination of fixed and variable 
pay. We share a single, firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool and people are awarded a 
share of that pool based on their performance. 
No variable remuneration is awarded if there is no 
or insufficient profit or capital. 
Introduction
We not only create transparency in the financial markets, we 
also firmly believe in being transparent as a company. 
Our global remuneration model provides for a detailed and 
transparent awarding procedure with appropriate checks 
and balances and publication requirements. The company 
has discussed the company’s remuneration model with 
regulators, legislators, major shareholder representatives 
and shareholder representative bodies and is continuously 
improving the remuneration model.
Key principles and policy
Our global remuneration model reflects our key principles 
achieved through the practical implementation of the 
General Remuneration Policy (as approved by the General 
Meeting on 19 May 2016 and published on our website, the 
‘General Remuneration Policy’), the Dutch Act on 
Remuneration Policy of Financial Undertakings (Wet 
Beloningsbeleid Financiële Ondernemingen, the 
‘Remuneration Act’), and the related laws and regulations in 
a manner that is tailored to the size of our enterprise and the 
way it is organized, as well as the nature, scope and 
complexity of our business activities. 
It is consistent with, and promotes, sound and effective risk 
management. It encourages alignment of the risks taken by 
employees and of the company itself, and does not 
encourage risk taking which is inconsistent with our risk 
profile. It is in line with our business strategy, objectives, 
values and interests and includes measures to avoid 
conflicts of interest. Finally, it must not lead to the risk that 
third parties are treated improperly (although we do not 
provide any investment service or ancillary service to third 
parties). 
Our global remuneration model
We are committed to attracting and retaining the best talent 
available. Our staff, including the members of the 
Management Board, receive competitive remuneration 
packages. This includes a fixed gross salary and a share from 
the singular firm-wide variable remuneration pool. 
The remuneration pool is accrued throughout the year 
based on Flow Traders’ operating result over the 
performance year reflecting company performance. 
The variable component of the total remuneration is 
dynamic, as it is a function of operating results: if there is no 
or insufficient profit or capital, there will be no variable 
remuneration. For example, if in any given year no profit is 
made, none of our employees will receive any variable 
remuneration. If the company incurs a loss, deferred 
variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited entirely. 
This policy also applies to members of the Management 
Board. 
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the beginning of 
each calendar year clear objectives are set depending on an 
employee’s role, which are in line with our company 
objectives for the year and our corporate key competencies:

competence and appropriate behavior or was responsible 
for behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of the 
company’s position, in accordance with applicable law. 
We do not award guaranteed variable remuneration to 
employees unless the guaranteed variable component is 
awarded in relation to hiring new staff, limited to the first 
year of employment, and only if we have a sound and strong 
capital base. We do not award severance payments if there 
is a serious imputable act or negligence by the employee in 
the fulfilment of his or her function or where an employee 
resigns voluntarily (unless this is the consequence of 
a serious imputable act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar 
handelen of nalaten) by the company). The company did not 
grant its employees any personal loans, guarantees or the 
like as part of their compensation package in 2018. 
No employee loans, guarantees or the like were outstanding 
on 31 December 2018. We do not provide any other ancillary 
benefits for any employee. We have not reserved or accrued 
any amounts to cover pension claims or retirement claims.
One of our core values is ownership, and we mean it both in 
terms of mindset and behavior as well as literally. We believe 
that being a shareholder aligns the interests of the company 
with those of our employees. To promote shareholding and 
reward loyalty we introduced the Flow Cash Incentive Plan 
(FCIP) in 2018 and promote the Flow Loyalty Incentive Plan 
(FLIP). Under the FCIP employees are offered the 
opportunity to buy company shares in the first open period 
of the year and receive an attractive annual cash incentive 
over a five-year period for as long as the shares are held by 
the participant. The right to the cash incentive is forfeited if 
the participant transfers his or her shares out of the FCIP or 
when the employment of the participant with Flow Traders 
ends. With the FLIP program, company shares are awarded 
to employees marking their two-year anniversary with the 
If awarded, for most recipients variable remuneration is paid 
in cash in two or three annual instalments. The deferred 
variable component acts as a first loss tranche to 
compensate for any operating loss in the subsequent year, 
acting as a buffer before such loss would impact 
shareholder equity. This serves as an important incentive for 
risk-aware behavior, keeping in mind the long-term 
objectives of the company and alignment with our risk 
appetite. We deem the deferral period sufficient given the 
company’s risk profile and horizon. Variable remuneration 
components may become subject to reduction or claw back 
if it is determined that the relevant employee or member of 
the Management Board did not meet adequate norms of 
drive, ownership and teamwork. Performance is reviewed 
during mid-year and year-end staff appraisals. 
Individual variable remuneration payable from the collective 
variable compensation pool is dependent on company and 
business unit performance, individual performance and the 
individual’s contribution to the long-term success of the 
company as a whole, discouraging a culture of ‘star’ behavior 
and fostering collaboration and teamwork. Flow Traders 
does not base variable remuneration directly on financial 
results achieved individually. The Supervisory Board 
approves the awarding of variable remuneration.

company. Shares awarded under the FLIP are subject to 
a lock-up period and remain with the employee regardless 
of the termination of his or her employment with Flow 
Traders. The cash incentive under the FCIP, as well as the 
shares awarded under the FLIP, are fully paid out from the 
variable compensation pool. The FCIP and the FLIP terms 
and conditions are subject to review by the Management 
Board annually. Both plans were approved by the 
Supervisory Board in 2017. As a part of these plans, shares 
have been and will be bought in the market. 
The Management Board is not eligible to participate in either 
of these plans. Both Thomas Wolff and Folkert Joling 
participated in the 2017 plan, before becoming Management 
Board members. They will receive the cash incentive over 
the shares bought in 2018. They are not eligible to 
participate in the 2018 FCIP. 
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. At our 
headquarters in Amsterdam, we partner with a pension 
provider, giving employees the freedom of choice to select 
the option that best suits their individual needs while 
incentivizing participation in the company-sponsored 
program. In our other offices we offer schemes that are 
driven by country-specific practices and regulations. 
Remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board
Introduction
The remuneration of, and other agreements with, the 
members of the Management Board are required to be 
determined by the Supervisory Board with due observance 
of the General Remuneration Policy and applicable laws and 
regulations. The Supervisory Board has assessed the 
remuneration of our Management Board members based on 
their performance in 2018.
The remuneration of our Management Board members 
consists of a relatively modest fixed base salary and 
a variable, partially deferred, remuneration in cash. 
The variable pay element depends on company 
performance, individual performance, and how 
a Management Board member contributed to the long-term 
success of the company as a whole. The ratio between fixed 
and variable pay - that is skewed towards variable pay - also 
serves as a tool to protect the sustainability of the company. 
It keeps costs low in less profitable years and allows these 
remuneration costs only to increase in good years. Moreover, 
“clawback” clauses apply, so variable pay already paid or 
awarded must be paid back under certain conditions, some 
relating to the financial viability of the company. The table 
below shows the total remuneration awarded to the 
individual members of the Management Board over 2018.

All members of the Management Board were awarded 
a gross fixed base salary of €94,608 over 2018.

Adjustments to variable remuneration
Variable remuneration to members of the Management 
Board is paid in cash in multiple instalments and may be 
reduced or clawed back under circumstances described in 
the Remuneration Act. As explained in the section above on 
our global remuneration model, the deferred variable 
component acts as a first loss tranche to compensate any 
operating loss in the subsequent year, before such loss 
would impact shareholder equity. If the company incurs 
a loss, deferred variable remuneration is reduced or 
forfeited entirely. In addition to the reduction and claw back 
Variable remuneration
Based on actual performance over 2018, all members of the 
Management Board combined received an aggregate 
variable compensation of €11,908,640. The variable 
remuneration awards to the members of the Management 
Board are determined on the basis of the following 
principles:
◾
◾
First, the maximum variable remuneration is set by the 
Supervisory Board within the limits of the firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool for a given year. As set out 
above, the pool is approximately 36 percent of the 
operating result and is directly contingent upon a 
positive operating result. Financial performance 
indicators are therefore integrated into this 
self-correcting mechanism: the variable remuneration 
of the members of the Management Board will be a 
direct reflection of actual realized company 
performance.
◾
◾
Second, within those limits, the variable remuneration is 
determined annually on the basis of a management-
assessment performance framework. This framework 
translates Flow Traders’ strategic business objectives 
into predetermined, assessable performance criteria 
that can be influenced by the Management Board’s 
performance within a Balanced Performance 
Scorecard. This Scorecard is composed of four 
non-financial focus areas, which aim to robustly assess 
the Management Board member’s performance within 
Flow Traders’ operating environment and stakeholder 
interests. These four areas comprise Growth, External 
Relationships, Internal Processes / Excellence, 
and People and Culture. Each year the Supervisory 
Board sets targets for the following performance 
elements, which are assessed annually, in order to 
determine management’s performance and variable 
remuneration:

members and eligibility for variable remuneration 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year while 
performing a single, one-off, assessment at the end of the 
year as set out in the best practice provisions of the 
Corporate Governance Code. Half-yearly discussions take 
place between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee for this purpose. 
Targets are set for each individual Management Board 
member and the Management Board as a whole. Significant 
underperformance or overperformance in respect of these 
targets can result in reductions or increases of the profit 
share that is awarded to a Management Board member. 
As mentioned, compensation of the members of the 
Management Board is limited to a relatively modest fixed 
remuneration component and a variable component 
dependent on operating result being realized. They did not 
receive share-based remuneration or other elaborate 
incentive schemes. This limits the number of scenarios to be 
meaningfully assessed as prescribed by the best practice 
provisions.
Market positioning
We believe our Management Board remuneration to be 
competitive within in our reference market. Our reference 
market is other proprietary trading firms including but not 
limited to for example IMC and Optiver. Notably, most of our 
reference firms do not publicly disclose remuneration of 
their executives. When comparing to executives of Dutch 
mid-cap listed companies, our Management Board 
remuneration is above average in years with strong financial 
results and relatively low in years with lower results. 
The variable remuneration component is not determined 
beforehand with minimums and maximums because it is 
occurrence of certain events) to an appropriate level if 
payment of the variable remuneration were to be 
unacceptable according to requirements of reasonableness 
and fairness. 
Scenario analyses carried out in respect of variable 
remuneration
The variable remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board is contingent upon a future, unknown, 
metric: the accrued firm-wide variable remuneration pool 
which itself depends on the operating result for the given 
financial year.
Because of the nature of our business activities and the fast 
paced industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
produce an unfair result due to extraordinary circumstances 
during the period in which the predetermined performance 
criteria have been or should have been applied, the 
Supervisory Board will have the power to adjust the value 
downwards or upwards. In addition, the Supervisory Board 
will have the authority under applicable Dutch law, including 
the Remuneration Act, to recover any variable remuneration 
awarded from a member of the Management Board on the 
basis of incorrect financial or other data (claw back). 
In addition, variable remuneration components may become 
subject to claw back and malus pursuant to the 
Remuneration Act and related regulations.
Pursuant to Dutch law, the Supervisory Board may 
furthermore adjust the variable remuneration (to the extent 
that it is subject to reaching certain targets and the

Remuneration of the members of the 
Supervisory Board
The General Meeting determines the remuneration of the 
members of the Supervisory Board following a proposal by 
the Supervisory Board. The remuneration of the members of 
the Supervisory Board consists of a fixed base salary and 
cannot be dependent upon the company’s results. 
None of the members of the Supervisory Board may receive 
shares, options for shares or similar rights to acquire shares 
as part of his or her remuneration. None of the members of 
the Supervisory Board may hold shares, options for shares or 
similar securities other than as a long-term investment. 
The members of the Supervisory Board may also not hold 
such securities, other than in accordance with the rules on 
holding or transacting in the company’s securities. Members 
of the Supervisory Board may not accept personal loans or 
guarantees from the company, other than in the normal 
course of business and subject to the prior approval of the 
Supervisory Board. During 2018, the company granted no 
personal loans, guarantees or the like to the members of 
the Supervisory Board. No personal loans, guarantees or the 
like to Supervisory Board members were outstanding on 
31 December 2018.
31 December 2018. We have not reserved nor accrued any 
amounts to cover pension claims or retirement claims. 
We do not provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
member of the Management Board.
Limited severance payments
We do not award severance payments to members of the 
Management Board that exceed 100 percent of their annual 
fixed remuneration, and do not award severance payments 
if there is a serious imputable act or negligence by the 
employee in the fulfilment of their functions, where they 
resign voluntarily (unless this is the consequence of a serious 
imputable act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar handelen of 
nalaten) or failure by the company), and we do not intend to 
award such payments in the future. In addition, relevant 
limitations apply under the Remuneration Act.

profit sharing. This is as designed and further explained in 
chapter Remuneration. This is the same for all employees 
within the company. 
Our pay ratio (the relationship between executive 
remuneration levels and those of employees) is low, 
compared to other companies listed on the AEX, AMX and 
AScX.
No shares, pensions, loans and other benefits
In 2018 the members of the Management Board did not 
receive any shares and no personal loans, guarantees or the 
like were granted by the company to the members of the 
Management Board as part of their compensation package.

Remuneration regulations are subject to change. Currently, 
the European Commission, European Parliament and 
European member states are negotiating new capital and 
remuneration requirements (IFR/IFD) which may affect our 
Dutch trading entity and our Group. We expect more 
certainty about the outcome in the next few months. 
Meanwhile, the remuneration rules in the Netherlands are in 
the process of being reviewed. We continuously monitor 
such changes but currently cannot assess in full what the 
exact implementation or impact of such changes will be. 
Changes may have a significant impact on the General 
Remuneration Policy, our global remuneration model and 
other remuneration practices of the company and its group 
companies. It may also impact our ability to attract or retain 
talent given the global and highly competitive nature of our 
industry.
Remuneration disclosures
In 2018, the total amount of variable remuneration awarded 
to all employees including members of the Management 
Board was €87.6 million (2017: €25.2 million). 
In 2018, companywide average compensation paid per 
employee was approximately €277,900, while variable 
remuneration amounted to around 73 percent of total 
compensation in 2018. In 2018, 29 employees, including the 
Management Board, were awarded remuneration of €1 
million or more (2017: 0). These employees mainly work in

Supervisory Board. The Management Board is 
responsible for the day-to-day management of 
the company, formulating strategies and policies, 
and setting and achieving our objectives. 
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the 
Management Board. Each board is accountable to 
the General Meeting for the performance of its 
duties. 
Our governance is reflected in our internal rules 
and regulations, including our Articles of 
Association, Management Board By-Laws, 
Supervisory Board By-Laws, the Terms of 
Reference of our Supervisory Board committees 
and our Code of Conduct. These, together with 
our policies, can be found on our website. 
Flow Traders remains focused on long-term value 
creation, culture and risk management.
Management Board
General
As at 31 December 2018, our Management Board consists of 
two Co-Chief Executive Officers (Dennis Dijkstra and Sjoerd 
Rietberg), the Chief Technology Officer (Thomas Wolff) and 
the Chief Trading Officer (Folkert Joling). Two of them can 
jointly represent the company, reflecting the four-eyes 
principle we operate across the company: two persons must 
sign off on significant business decisions. The Management 
Board is charged with managing the company, subject to the 
limitations set out in the Articles of Association and the 
Management Board By-Laws. 
The Management Board is responsible for the continuity of 
the company and is guided by the interests of the company 
and its business, taking into consideration the company’s 
long-term value creation and the interests of the company’s 
stakeholders, including our employees and our 
shareholders. Decisions are thus made in a balanced 
manner. Management has formulated a strategy in line with 
the long-term value creation. Subsequently, Management is 
responsible for creating a culture that entails long-term 
value creation for the company. The Management Board is 
supervised by the Supervisory Board in this regard. 
Management is alert to indications of misconduct or 
irregularities and reviews related policies regularly. 
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Code, 
Management has also taken measures to avoid conflicts of 
interest. 
The members of the Management Board are eager to keep 
their knowledge and skills up to date and spend sufficient 
time on their duties and responsibilities.
The Management Board is also responsible for identifying 
and managing risks associated with the company’s strategy 
and activities. Management ensures that the company has 
adequate internal risk management and control systems in 
place. Moreover, the Management Board takes account of 
the effectiveness of the design and the operation of the 
internal risk management and control systems. The Internal 
Audit Function is the responsibility of Management. 
Management maintains regular contact with the Global 
Head of Internal Audit, responsible for the Internal Audit 
Function. 
Before the Management Board can approve any resolutions 
entailing a significant change in the identity or nature of the 
company, it must obtain the approval of the General 
Meeting. The Management Board also has to obtain the 
approval of the Supervisory Board for a number of 
resolutions specified in the Management Board By-Laws. 
Appointing and dismissing Management Board 
members
As set out in more detail in our Articles of Association and 
the Management Board By-Laws, the Supervisory Board 
makes a non-binding nomination or proposal to appoint, 
suspend or remove a Management Board member. 
Following a nomination by the Supervisory Board, the 
General Meeting can appoint members of the Management 
Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast,

The Supervisory Board is alert to indications of misconduct 
or irregularities. It supervises the Management Board when 
appropriate follow-up actions are taken. In case of a conflict 
of interest, the Supervisory Board is responsible for the 
decision-making on how to handle conflicts of interest. 
The functioning of the Supervisory Board as a whole and the 
functioning of its members individually is evaluated at least 
once a year. A succession plan for the Supervisory Board is in 
place, with the Supervisory Board Profile and the Equal 
Opportunity Policy taken into account. We also have 
a transparent procedure in place for the (re)appointment of 
Supervisory Board members. 
Supervisory Board
General
The Supervisory Board supervises the Management Board 
and the general course of affairs of the company and its 
business. The Supervisory Board supervises the company’s 
focus on long-term value creation and the way in which this 
is implemented in the company’s strategy and culture. 
The Supervisory Board considers the organizational 
structure of the company as a whole, as well as general and 
financial risks and the internal risk management and control 
systems. In performing its duties, the Supervisory Board acts 
in accordance with the interests of the company and takes 
the relevant interests of the company’s stakeholders into 
account. Decisions are thus made in a balanced manner. 
representing more than one third of the issued capital of the 
company. Appointment of a different candidate than the 
one proposed by the Supervisory Board requires an absolute 
majority of the votes cast at the General Meeting, 
representing at least 50 percent of the issued capital of the 
company. Management Board members are appointed for 
a maximum term of four years at the time. According to the 
Corporate Governance Code, there is no limitation in the 
duration of their entire service. Any (re)appointment of 
a member of the Management Board must be approved by 
the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). 
The General Meeting can suspend or remove a member of 
the Management Board upon a proposal by the Supervisory 
Board with an absolute majority of the votes cast. If votes 
within the Supervisory Board meeting tie on a proposed 
nomination, suspension, or dismissal, the General Meeting 
shall decide. Suspension or removal of a Management Board 
member, not proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires 
an absolute majority of the votes cast at the General 
Meeting, representing at least 50 percent of the issued 
capital of the company.
The functioning of the Management Board as a whole and 
the functioning of its members individually is evaluated 
several times per year. A succession plan for the 
Management Board is in place and discussed regularly. 
Moreover, we have a transparent procedure in place for the 
(re)appointment of Management Board members. 
Management Board members are appointed for a term of 
four years and may be reappointed for a term of a maximum 
of four years at a time. The Equal Opportunity Policy will be 
taken into account at each (re)appointment.

General Meetings can be held as often as the Management 
Board or the Supervisory Board deem necessary. An AGM is 
also convened in case of a decision entailing a significant 
change in the identity or character of the company or its 
business. 
One or more shareholders representing at least the 
statutory threshold of three percent of the voting rights may 
request that the Management Board places items on the 
agenda of a General Meeting. The Management Board must 
honor such a request provided that the request is received in 
writing at least 60 days before the date of such a meeting. 
Each shareholder is entitled – either in person or via proxy – 
to attend the AGM and to vote during the AGM. The AGM is 
the perfect place for shareholders and the Management 
Board and Supervisory Board to interact. At an AGM, 
shareholders can ask questions directly to the Management 
Board and/or the Supervisory Board. Our Management 
Board and Supervisory Board strongly encourage 
shareholders to interact. 
During the AGM held on 26 April 2018 in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands, shareholders voted in favor of adopting the 
annual accounts, determining the total dividend at €0.65 per 
share, discharging members of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board from liability, appointment of two

General Meeting, shares and shareholders 
Flow Traders highly encourages shareholder participation in 
the decision-making of the General Meeting. It is of great 
importance to the company that its shareholders have an 
actual say in the Annual General Meeting of shareholders 
(AGM), and the company therefore encourages an open 
dialogue. Flow Traders ensures that the General Meeting is 
adequately provided with information.
Agenda items of the AGM that need to be handled as 
separate agenda items on the basis of the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Dutch Civil Code or the Articles of 
Association will be handled as such. 
Flow Traders holds an AGM within six months following the 
end of the financial year. The agenda for this meeting 
includes the adoption of the annual accounts, the content of 
the annual report covering the previous year’s financial 
business, the policy of the company on additions to reserves 
and on distributions of profits, any proposal to distribute 
profits, (re)appointment of the external auditor, substantial 
changes in the governance structure of the company and in 
the compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, 
material changes to the Articles of Association, filling 
vacancies on the Management Board and/or Supervisory 
Board, proposals placed on the agenda by the Management 
Board, and the release from liability of the members of the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board for their 
performance during the previous financial year. 
the company’s technology in terms of competitiveness and 
functionality at least once a year. The committee supervises 
the Management Board on the operations of the company’s 
security systems and related risks. It maintains regular 
contact with our trading and technology departments. 
The Management Board members and relevant others may, 
from time to time, be invited to the Trading & Technology 
Committee meetings.
Diversity
The Supervisory Board has drawn up and adopted an Equal 
Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy). In this policy we explain 
our objective to treat everyone equally during the hiring 
process and throughout their careers at Flow Traders. We are 
committed to being a truly equal opportunity employer, by 
recruiting, retaining and promoting people based on merit, 
and merit alone. We are a firm believer in the benefits of 
a diverse workplace and we do not make any concessions to 
quality. Our objective is to provide equal employment 
opportunities to all qualified job applicants and equal career 
perspectives for all of our employees, provided they 
perform highly. When positions become available, we 
actively encourage all candidates to apply and ensure that 
the selection and retention processes are truly equal for all 
applicants and employees. We aim to provide an inclusive 
work environment for all employees. This also holds for our 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it comes 
to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the Management 
Board, we adhere to the same principles of equal 
opportunity as set out above. As a result, our current 
Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
education, nationality, and professional backgrounds. 
This diverse composition entails constructive dialogues and 
shared responsibility, resulting in an effective and efficient

percent of the issued share capital; and (iii) at a price

shares and not higher than the opening price on Euronext 
Amsterdam on the day of repurchase plus ten percent. 
Any repurchases exceeding these limits need approval by 
the General Meeting.
In order to align our employees’ interests with those of our 
shareholders, the company awards 100 shares in the 
company to most employees with a tenure of over two 
years. The company purchased such shares under the 
authority granted by the General Meeting over the course of 
2017 and 2018. 
At the 2019 AGM the Management Board will propose to the 
General Meeting to renew its authorization to repurchase 
shares in the company. Furthermore, at the 2019 AGM the 
Management Board intends to propose to the General 
Meeting to cancel shares in the share capital of the 
Company held or repurchased by the Company under the 
aforementioned authorization to repurchase shares in the 
Company.

company’s office and this copy shall be made available for 
inspection by the shareholders until the end of the General 
Meeting.

to grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares up to and 
including 26 October 2019 for up to ten percent of the total 
number of shares issued at the time of the General Meeting 
for any purposes. Any issuance exceeding this limit needs 
approval by the General Meeting.
In addition, the General Meeting renewed the authority of 
the Management Board, subject to the Supervisory Board’s 
approval, to restrict or exclude applicable pre-emptive 
rights when issuing ordinary shares or granting rights to 
subscribe for ordinary shares up to and including 26 October 
2019. 
At our next AGM, scheduled to be held on 8 May 2019, the

Articles of Association or to wind up the company with an 
absolute majority of the votes cast. This can only be done if 
the Management Board has proposed to amend the Articles 
of Association or wind up the company. Such proposal has to 
be approved by the Supervisory Board.

Relationship agreement and shareholders agreement
Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. entered into 
a relationship agreement with the company and 
a shareholders’ agreement (amongst each other).
The relationship agreement is a Dutch law-governed 
agreement that contains certain arrangements regarding 
the relationship between the parties thereto. The agreement 
currently grants each of Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak 
Investments B.V. a specific right to nominate or designate 
one Supervisory Board member for appointment (and 
replacement). This right expires, in respect of each relevant 
party, if such party ceases to, directly or indirectly, hold 
more than five percent of the shares in the company 
provided that and for as long as, in aggregate, Avalon 
Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. together continue 
to, directly or indirectly, hold more than five percent of the 
company’s shares, Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak 
Investments B.V. shall be entitled to jointly designate one 
Supervisory Board member for appointment. 
The relationship agreement also governs the composition of 
the Supervisory Board committees. The agreement 
terminates in respect of each of the shareholders, if such 
party’s aggregate shareholding in the company (be it direct, 
indirect or together with a permitted transferee) falls below 
five percent of the company’s outstanding share capital. 
In case of, among other things, the company becoming 
subject to insolvency procedures, liquidation, delisting, 
a merger or a spin-off (with the company as disappearing 
entity), the agreement automatically terminates.
Under the shareholders’ agreement governed by Dutch law, 
Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. have agreed 
on certain arrangements in respect of their shareholding in 
the company. These arrangements include an obligation for

tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable compensation 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year 
while performing a single, one-off assessment at the 
end of the year as set out in the best practice 
provisions. Semi-annual discussions take place 
between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee for this 
purpose. In this manner, the Supervisory Board 
regularly assesses the performance indicators and the 
potential resulting variable compensation for the 
Management Board members. Targets are set for each 
individual Management Board member and the 
Management Board as a whole. Significant 
underperformance or overperformance in respect of 
these targets can result in reductions or increases of 
the profit share that is awarded to a Management Board 
member. Deviation from this provision is likely to 
continue until further notice.
◾
◾
Independence of Supervisory Board members
Best practice provision 2.1.7 provides that any one of the 
criteria referred to in best practice provision 2.1.8 (i.-v.) 
should be applicable to at most one Supervisory Board 
member and that the total number of Supervisory 
Board members to whom the criteria referred to in best 
The Management Board assesses the way in which the 
Internal Audit Function fulfils its responsibility annually and 
takes the opinion of the Audit Committee into account.
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
The Corporate Governance Code defines a company as 
a long-term form of collaboration between the principal 
corporate bodies of a company. For us, these corporate 
bodies include the Management Board, the Supervisory 
Board and the General Meeting. The Management Board 
values and considers the interests of the various 
stakeholders involved. Good corporate governance results 
in effective decision-making in a manner which enhances 
shareholder value and enables a company to maintain 
a culture of integrity, transparency, and trust. The company 
has a long standing focus on a long-term value creation 
strategy, culture and risk. We acknowledge the importance 
of good corporate governance and endeavor to comply in 
general with the provisions of the Corporate Governance 
Code and comply fully with it, with the exception of the 
following provisions: 
◾
◾
Analyses carried out in respect of variable 
compensation
Best practice provision 3.2.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code provides that the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee should submit a proposal to 
the Supervisory Board concerning the remuneration of 
individual members of the Management Board. 
The proposal is drawn up in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy that has been established and will, 
in any event, cover the remuneration structure, the 
amount of the fixed and variable remuneration 
components, the performance criteria used, the 
scenario analyses that are carried out and the pay ratios 
policies. Each employee is responsible for ensuring an 
honest and ethical conduct of business within the company. 
Please refer to the chapter Flow Traders and Society for 
more details on our anti-bribery, anti-corruption and 
anti-money laundering policies, our Code of Conduct, our 
Whistleblower Policy, our Gift Policy and Tax Principles.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit Function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and objective 
assurance, advice, and insight. An efficient and effective 
internal audit framework contributes to strong internal 
controls and to a robust corporate governance structure, 
which can address significant risks. The scope of internal 
audit work includes the examination and evaluation of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of Flow Traders’ risk 
management, control and governance processes as well as 
the quality of performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve Flow Traders’ stated goals and 
objectives. 
Our Group Internal Audit Charter defines the Internal Audit 
Function’s purpose, authority, responsibility and position 
within Flow Traders. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance provided by 
the Institute of Internal Auditors. 
The Internal Audit Function is an integral part of our 
reporting cycle. The Internal Audit Function reports to the 
Audit Committee and to the Co-CEO responsible for the 
Internal Audit Function. It aligns its efforts with the external 
auditor and reports its audit results to the Management 
Board, the essence of its audit results to the Audit 
Committee and informs the external auditor.

the composition of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. The policy should address the 
concrete targets relating to diversity. Flow Traders 
deviates from best practice provision 2.1.5 as no 
concrete targets were set on diversity. However, the 
Supervisory Board has drawn up and adopted an Equal 
Opportunity Policy addressing the diversity aspects of 
the composition of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. We believe that this policy also 
attains the purpose of best practice provision 2.1.5. 
In our view, the policy contributes to good governance, 
as it reflects our objective to treat everyone equally 
during the hiring process and throughout their careers 
at Flow Traders. Flow Traders is committed to being 
a truly equal opportunity employer, by recruiting, 
retaining and promoting people based on merit, and 
merit alone. The company is a firm believer in the 
benefits of a diverse workplace and does not make any 
concessions to quality. The objective is to provide equal 
employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all 
employees, provided they perform highly. 
When positions become available, Flow Traders actively 
encourages all candidates to apply and ensure that the 
selection and retention processes are truly equal for all 
applicants and employees. This also holds for the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it 
comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, Flow Traders adheres to the same 
principle of equal opportunity as set out above. 
As a result, our current Supervisory Board is diverse in 
terms of, inter alia, age, education, nationality, and 
professional backgrounds. 
Management Board or of the Supervisory Board and/or 
a resolution to remove a member of the Management 
Board or of the Supervisory Board by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast. According to the Corporate 
Governance Code, it may be provided that this majority 
should represent a given proportion of the issued 
capital, which proportion may not exceed one-third. 
If this proportion of the capital is not represented at the 
meeting, but an absolute majority of the votes cast is in 
favor of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of 
a nomination or to remove a board member, a new 
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may 
be passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
regardless of the proportion of the capital represented 
at the meeting. 
In deviation of this best practice provision, the 
company’s Articles of Association provide that the 
General Meeting may pass a resolution to cancel the 
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of 
a member of the Management Board or of the 
Supervisory Board and/or a resolution to remove 
a member of the Management Board or of the 
Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes 
cast, representing more than 50 percent of the 
company’s issued capital. In addition, the company’s 
Articles of Association provide that if this quorum is not 
present or represented at the meeting, such resolution 
cannot be adopted and in order for such a resolution to 
be adopted, a new meeting should be convened in 
which more than 50 percent of the company’s issued 
capital is represented and an absolute majority of the 
votes are cast in favor of such resolution.
◾
◾
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
Best practice provision 2.1.5 provides that the 
Supervisory Board should draw up a diversity policy for 
practice provision 2.1.8 are applicable should account 
for less than half of the total number of Supervisory 
Board Members. Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius, as 
founders of the company, were attracted to their role 
as Supervisory Board members because of their specific 
business-related expertise. They do not qualify as 
independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they are former members of the 
Management Board of the company prior to its 
conversion and because they represent shareholders of 
the company owning an interest of over ten percent. 
Deviation from this provision is likely to continue until 
Roger Hodenius and Jan van Kuijk cease to be members 
of the Supervisory Board.
◾
◾
Independence of committee members
As Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent Supervisory Board members as set out 
above, this also affects two Supervisory Board 
committees of which they are members. Best practice 
provision 2.3.4 provides that more than half of the 
members of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee should be 
independent. Both Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius are 
members of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, implying that half (and not more than half) 
of its members are independent. Deviation from this 
provision is likely to continue until Roger Hodenius and 
Jan van Kuijk cease to be members of the Supervisory 
Board. 
◾
◾
Quorum
Best practice provision 4.3.3 provides that the General 
Meeting of a company that is not subject to the 
statutory large company regime (structuurregime) may

Compliance with article 2:166 of the Dutch Civil Code
Article 2:166 of the Dutch Civil Code states that the seats in 
the Management Board and the Supervisory Board should 
contain at least 30 percent female and 30 percent male 
members. At Flow Traders, this is currently not the case. 
We believe in the drive to excel every day, and performing at 
the highest level possible, throughout all levels of our 
organization. To achieve this we seek to recruit, retain and 
promote the best talent, regardless of, inter alia, age, 
education, ethnicity, gender, nationality, professional 
background, religious faith or sexual orientation. 
Our selection is based on relevant education, professional 
experience and the competencies required. The persons 
fulfilling their roles in the Management Board and,

best fit for their roles.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1.	
Reporting entity
Flow Traders N.V. (referred to as the ‘Company’) is a public limited liability company (naamloze 
vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its seat (statutaire 
zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, having its registered office at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 
1018 LL Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Trade Register of the Chamber of 
Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, afdeling Handelsregister) under number 34294936.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is a leading global technology-enabled liquidity provider 
that specializes in exchange traded products (ETPs). 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the annual period ended 31 December 
2018 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders N.V., its subsidiaries and associates. 
The annual financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company’s Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board on 27 February 2019 subject to adoption by the General 
Meeting of shareholders.
2.	 Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption.
3.	 Basis of preparation 
a)	
Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (‘IFRS-EU’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS-EU provides several options in 
accounting principles. The Group’s accounting principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding 
the options available are set out in the section ‘Significant accounting policies’ below.
b)	
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except 
for the following items and unless otherwise indicated:
◾
◾
financial assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with changes 
recognized in profit or loss; 
◾
◾
investments fair value through OCI assets are measured at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses which are 
recognized in profit or loss.
c)	
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the Group’s 
functional currency. All financial information presented in euros has been rounded to the 
nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to form opinions and make 
estimates and assumptions that influence the reported value of assets and liabilities and of 
income and expenditure. The actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are constantly assessed. Revisions of estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. For more details, we refer you to 
the chapter on Fair values of financial instruments.
d)	
Principles for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows
The consolidated statement of cash flows is based on the indirect method.
The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, including trading activities, investment 
activities and financing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of 
acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments other than in the course 
of operations, as well as acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property and 
equipment. Movements to the extent that those have not resulted in cash flows are eliminated. 
e)	
Restatement of 2017 numbers
The Group applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, however there was a limited impact on the figures. 
If the figures are restated this will be mentioned separately in the related table of the report.

The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, 
the carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part 
thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair 
value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized 
in profit or loss.
g)	
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of the Group at 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the foreign currency 
difference recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising on the translation of investments fair 
value through OCI are recognized in other comprehensive income unless the instrument is 
impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at 
fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based 
on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
4.	 Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
f)	
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group entities.
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from 
intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated 
against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee if it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date when control ceases. 
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.
Investments in associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or 
joint control, over its financial and operating activities. Control or significant influence follows 
from facts and circumstances, but there is a rebuttable presumption that significant influence 
when the Group holds between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting power of another 
entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized 
initially at cost.

The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan 
commitments, into the following categories:
◾
◾
trading payables, measured at fair value through profit and loss;
◾
◾
financial liabilities held for trading at fair value through profit or loss;
◾
◾
other financial liabilities measured at amortized costs.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group acquires or incurs 
principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of 
a portfolio that is managed together for short-term profit.
Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value in 
the statement of financial position, with transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. 
All changes in fair value are recognized as part of net trading income in profit or loss. 
Trading assets and liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition.
Trading receivables and payables
Such assets are recognized initially at fair value with any directly attributable transaction costs 
recognized in profit or loss. These items are valued at fair value through profit or loss on initial 
recognition and changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss as they arise. 
Investments fair value through OCI
Investments fair value through OCI are non-derivative financial assets. Investments fair value 
through OCI are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in other 
comprehensive income as part of the change in fair value at the next remeasurement and they 
are never reclassified into profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other 
than foreign currency differences on fair value through OCI debt instruments, are recognized in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an 
investment is derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit 
or loss.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. 
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euros at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in 
the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of equity. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, 
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclas-
sified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
h)	
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three 
months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
i)	
Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are originated. 
All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) 
are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or 
issue.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
◾
◾
trading receivables, measured at fair value through profit and loss;
◾
◾
investments fair value through OCI;
◾
◾
financial assets held for trading at fair value through profit or loss; and
◾
◾
other financial assets at amortized costs.

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2018

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the 
transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group 
determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the 
fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or 
liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, 
then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, 
that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market 
data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on theoretical prices whereby the price 
differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those theoretical prices can differ 
from quoted market prices. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department monitors whether all 
differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the Group on the basis 
of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price 
that would be received to sell a net long position or paid to transfer a net short position for 
a particular risk exposure. Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the 
reporting period during which the change has occurred.
j)	
Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. 
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Other financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any directly  
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes 
a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated 
with its capital contributions to the United States subsidiaries. Gains or losses on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI while any gains 
or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. 
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded 
in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of offset is agreed 
between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS-EU, 
for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading 
activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at 
that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market 
for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

l)	
Leased assets
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount 
equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting 
policy applicable to that asset. 
Other leases are operating leases and are not recognized in the Group’s statement of financial 
position.
m)	 Impairment 
Non-derivative financial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and other debt 
financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee 
contracts, in this section all referred to as ‘financial instruments’, is based on the credit losses 
expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless 
there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, 
the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). 
Impairment losses on investments fair value through OCI are recognized by reclassifying the 
losses accumulated in the fair value reserve from equity to profit or loss. The loss that is reclas-
sified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any 
principal repayment and amortization, and the current fair value, less of impairment loss 
recognized previously in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the 
recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
For other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, 
the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is 
based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to 
the debtors and the economic environment. 
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as the difference 
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognized in 
profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over 
the estimated useful lives of each component. Leased assets under finance leases are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant items of 
property and equipment are as follows:
◾
◾
hardware: 5 years;
◾
◾
office fixtures: 5 years;
◾
◾
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date 
and adjusted if appropriate. 
k)	
Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the estimated 
useful lives of each component. The estimated useful life of significant intangible assets is 5 
years.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognized and in subsequent years measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of equity-accounted investees is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-
accounted investee as a whole.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.

amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no 
impairment loss had been recognized.
n)	
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash variable 
compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
o)	
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognized as finance cost. 
p)	
Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease as lease expenses.
q)	
Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial expenses 
related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and are therefore 
directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading income.
r)	
Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized 
in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items recognized 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a financial asset to be in default when 
internal or external information indicated that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding 
contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the 
Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the 
contractual cash flows.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is 
recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed 
reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU 
(group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying

s)	
Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognized at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the 
carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in the share premium.
t)	
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental 
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs 
and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sale will be withdrawn. Management must be 
committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year 
from the date of the classification.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the 
statement of financial position.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either 
has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and is part of a single coordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
5.	 Operating segments
The Group operates in the following regions via its subsidiaries in Europe (the Netherlands, 
Romania), the Americas (the United States of America) and Asia (Singapore and Hong Kong). 
In 2018 a branch office in London was opened.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to 
tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any 
withholding tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
◾
◾
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
◾
◾
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in the foreseeable future; and
◾
◾
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact 
of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group 
believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its 
assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and management judgement. 
This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement about future 
events. New information may become available that would cause the Group to change its 
judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities or the collectability of tax assets. 
Such changes will impact tax expense in the period that such a change in estimate is made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or 
the tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.

The Group does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 16, as the amount of the operational leases 
outstanding are limited and in the short term the impact is expected to be immaterial.
Other new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.
8.	 Fair values of financial instruments
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the 
following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in 
determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
Valuation models 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, depending on the 
inputs used for making the measurements.
◾
◾
Level 1: inputs that are quoted, unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical 
instruments;
◾
◾
Level 2: inputs, other than within Level 1, that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valuated using: 
quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical 
or similar instruments in markets that are considered inactive; or other valuation 
techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable market data; 
◾
◾
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the 
valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a significant effect on the 
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valuated based on 
quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or 
assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the 
price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly 
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date.
The Group uses widely recognized valuation techniques and models (including net present 
value models and comparisons with similar instruments for which market observable prices 
exist) for determining the fair value of common, simple financial instruments that use only 
6.	 New standards and interpretations
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 
The Group applied IFRS 9 Recognition and Measurement for the first time. IFRS 9 brings 
together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: classification and 
measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Assets previously 
classified as investments available for sale are now classified as investments fair value through 
OCI.
The trading portfolio is valued at fair value through profit and loss.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contract with customers 
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when 
revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 
Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. 
IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, permitting 
early adoption. Given the nature of the Group’s operations there is no impact on the reported 
figures.
7.	 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
IFRS 16 Leases 
The IASB issued the new standard for accounting for leases – IFRS 16 Leases. The new standard 
does not significantly change the accounting for leases for lessors. However, it does require 
lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, with the 
corresponding right of use assets. Lessees must apply a single model for all recognized leases, 
but will have the option not to recognize ‘short-term’ leases and leases of ‘low-value’ assets. 
Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern for recognized leases will be similar to today’s 
finance lease accounting, with interest and depreciation expense recognized separately in the 
statement of profit or loss. 
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is 
permitted provided the new revenue standard, IFRS 15, is applied on the same date. Lessees 
must adopt IFRS 16 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.

The following reconciliations are executed on a daily basis:
◾
◾
reconciliation of the positions - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles the 
positions of the Trading department with information provided by the prime brokers. 
All differences are reconciled and agreed by the Trading department of the Group and the 
prime brokers;
◾
◾
reconciliation of prices - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles prices as provided 
by the Trading Department with those of the prime brokers and/or data from external data 
vendors. All differences are reconciled and the Risk and Mid-Office department makes 
sure that any required follow up action is taken, either by the prime broker or the Trading 
department. Therefore, all prices are checked with independent sources.
Results of these reconciliation processes are communicated and agreed with Heads of Trading, 
the Risk and Mid-Office department and the Management Board on a daily basis.
a)	
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The Group mainly trades on regulated and active markets. The financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading are carried at fair value, based whenever possible on quoted market prices, 
as published by exchanges, market data vendors and prime brokers. 
The valuation of trading positions, both the long and the short positions, is determined by 
reference to last traded prices from similar instruments from the exchanges at the reporting 
date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are carried at fair 
value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted market prices. 
The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused by the fact that the Group 
continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities based on all available information. 
This includes prices for identical and near-identical positions, as well as the prices for securities 
underlying the Group’s positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on 
which the financial asset or liability is traded closes. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office 
department checks the theoretical price independently. As part of Its review, It monitors 
whether all price adjustments can be substantiated with market inputs. Consequently, 
such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to determine fair 
value. 
observable market data and require little management judgement and estimation. Observable 
prices or model inputs (including risk-free and benchmark interest rates and credit spreads 
used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, 
equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and correlations) are usually 
available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives and 
simple over-the-counter derivatives. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs 
reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and thus reduces the uncertainty 
associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable market prices and inputs 
varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific 
events and general conditions in the financial markets.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in determining appropriate portfolio-level 
adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask 
spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. Similarly, 
when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, it takes into account any existing 
arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the 
counterparty).
Valuation framework
The Group has a control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. 
This framework includes a Risk and Mid-Office department which is independent of the Trading 
department and reports directly to the Management Board. The Risk and Mid-Office 
department has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading and all 
significant fair value measurements. The daily reconciliation of the positions and prices 
between the prime brokers and the Trading department is most important.
The prime brokers of the Group provide electronic position statements on a daily basis, which 
are uploaded automatically into the Group’s databases. The Group and its prime brokers agreed 
when files will be available and methods for transmission and communication. All data is 
normalized by the Group so it can be used in multiple internal systems. The information is 
mainly used for daily independent reconciliation of positions and prices, resulting in profit and 
loss accounts.

Level 1 and Level 2. There are no Level 3 positions.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations  
Included in financial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2018 was a borrowing of 
USD152,500,000 which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United 
States subsidiaries, which have their functional currencies in USD. This borrowing is being used 
to hedge the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or 
losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to OCI to offset any gains or losses 
on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the 
net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the USD 
borrowing. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging 
instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise when 
the amount of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the amount of the 
borrowing.
b)	
Investments fair value through OCI
The fair value of Investments fair value through OCI is determined by reference to their quoted 
closing bid price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique 
and are classified as Level 2.
c)	
Other receivables 
The carrying value of other receivables with a maturity of less than one year is assumed to 
approximate their fair values.

Payables for securities bought
In accordance with the Group’s policy of trade date accounting for regular way sale and 
purchase transactions, payables for securities bought represent amounts payables for 
securities that were purchased, but not yet settled as at the reporting date. The amount 
payable is based on the net unsettled amount per clearing institution.
Borrowings
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to facilitate the trading 
activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of financial instruments). The drawn 
amounts on these facilities continuously fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given 
moment.
The Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities with ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V. 
(AACB), totaling € 2,450 million. In addition, the Group entered into interest-bearing credit 
facilities for portfolio margin financing with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), RBS and 
Goldman Sachs. These facilities can be modified or terminated at any time. The facilities are 
exclusively for the financing of positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary 
course of the trading activities using the various prime brokers. 
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin requirements 
(representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is variable and calculated on a daily 
basis depending on portfolio size and composition) in cash or securities as security for our 
positions held with the relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the settlement of 
off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. These amounts 
significantly exceed expected loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes 
into account the likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of 
counterparty default is deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the counter-
parties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:
CARRYING AMOUNT
2018

Cash and cash equivalents
10,054
5,879
Trading receivables
3,039,875
2,126,594
Other receivables
13,927
10,302
Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are guaranteed by the 
central counterparty or clearing house related to that exchange. Members of these clearing 
houses are required to deposit substantial amounts of cash, bonds or equities as guarantee for 
any failure to settlement of trading. 
The Group manages credit risk through its Risk and Mid-Office department that provide 
specific guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit risk. 
Policies include amongst others:
◾
◾
limits for individual product types;
◾
◾
limits per counterparty;
◾
◾
limits on the duration of the exposure;
◾
◾
limits for settlement types;
◾
◾
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty exposures are 
monitored on an intra-day basis.

amounts for the parties to the agreement that is enforceable only following an event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties or following other 
predetermined events. In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on 
a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can receive and grant 
collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in respect of the following 
transactions:
◾
◾
derivatives;
◾
◾
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
◾
◾
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities as set 
out in Notes 15 and 23 in respect of derivatives (including swaps). Such collateral is subject to 
standard industry terms including, where appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. 
This means that securities received/granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the 
term of the transaction, but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also 
give each party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure to 
post collateral.
The following tables reconcile the ‘Gross amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities 
presented in the statement of financial position’, as set out above, to the line items presented 
in the statement of financial position.
During 2018, the Group observed no significant concentration of credit risks towards single 
counterparties and geographically there was no concentration of credit risk. 
Based on the Group’s counterparty credit risk monitoring, the Group believes that no 
impairment is necessary in respect of trading and other receivables.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial liabilities that:
◾
◾
are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
◾
◾
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that 
covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase 
agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. Similar financial instruments 
include derivatives, sales and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase 
agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, 
such as loans and deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the 
statement of financial position. This is because they create a right to offset recognized

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2018 106
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize the risk for market movements and 
does not engage in long and/or short only positions. The direction of market movements, i.e. 
what the Group considers directional market risk, is not relevant for the Group because of this 
long/short trading strategy. Because of the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed. 
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and 
settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are captured in the risk 
and margin requirements which the Group is required to post at its prime brokers and clearing 
firms. The consolidated margin and haircut requirements over 2018 is shown in the Capital 
management paragraph. The haircut set out in the graph below reflects the mandatory capital 
requirement of the prime brokers. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk 
close to zero remains as a result of inefficiencies in the models of the prime brokers. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the euro, but also 
United States dollars and Singapore dollars. 
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well as net results 
of these foreign operations during the year.
The gross amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities and their net amounts disclosed in 
the above tables have been measured in the statement of financial position on fair value.
Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial instrument 
fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited to, such as interest rates, 
volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and equity prices. The Risk and 
Mid-Office department monitors market risk exposure on a continuous basis (including 
intra-day). Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated risk for the Group, limit 
breaches, if any, will trigger action from the Risk and Mid-Office department in order to reduce 
the risk. 
In addition to the Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily. The applicable haircut and margins are computed by the Group’s prime 
brokers. The Risk and Mid-Office department computes the haircut using internal models 
enabling intra-day monitoring. Limits are set on both capital- and credit usage.
Long and short trading positions include securities and derivatives such as: shares, American 
depositary receipts (ADRs), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRAs), 
and exchange-traded products (ETP). All traded financial instruments are liquid instruments. 
Therefore, the portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame and with limited 
costs.

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2018 107
As the Group is active in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in 
underlying values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.  
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and margins are computed 
by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis measures all positions, individual and 
correlated, and reflects the different risk components. The third party haircut calculation 
confirms the internal assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is 
exposed to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under Market risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime brokers, 
is monitored on a daily basis.
Maturity based on contractual undiscounted cash flows is as follows:

The Group manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency. 
The Group does use financial instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net 
investments in foreign operations or net results of foreign operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial instruments. The Group 
is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches of arranged interest rates of assets 
and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These 
limits ensure that interest rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and 
hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. 
All financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair value on 
the balance sheet. All positions carried on the balance sheet are short term and listed on 
exchanges and therefore liquid and tradable. 
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility available to 
facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the balance sheet. In order to match the 
liquidity and short holding period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate 
payable, which is floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact 
that the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short positions and 
in the EFP of the future. 
Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as the Group’s 
investments in investments fair value through OCI securities. In addition, for its option 
positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk factor. Other 
factors to consider are time and dividend expectations. 
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual positions per 
product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the size of the exposure, concen-
trations, pricing and valuation parameters and natural hedging between these long and short 
positions.

Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the prime brokers 
through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well as cash generated from our 
operating activities. As of 31 December 2018, the Group held € 10.1 million in cash and cash 
equivalents compared to € 5.9 million as of 31 December 2017. These balances are maintained 
primarily to support operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient 
short-term access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.
The Group maintains a highly liquid balance sheet, with a large portion of its total assets 
consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable securities and short-term trading receivables 
(arising from securities transactions). 
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intra-day basis and maintains significant 
portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to facilitate trading. These facilities 
are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as well as all financial assets in accounts held at the 
respective prime brokers. The Group has no outstanding borrowings other than the portfolio 
financing facilities with prime brokers.

Notes to the parent company financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euros, unless stated otherwise.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the determination  
of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and 
determination of the result for its parent Company financial statements, the Group applies the 
option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the 
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result 
(hereinafter referred to as principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent company 
financial statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS-EU financial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has significant influence, 
are measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated statements chapter 1 to 4 for 
a description of the Group’s IFRS-EU principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Group’s share in the results of these 
participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the transfer of assets and liabilities 
between (i) the Group and its participating interests on (ii) between participating interests 
themselves, are not recognized.

cash payment but as a payment in shares, or decide that holders of shares shall have the 
option to receive a distribution as a cash payment and/or as a payment in shares, out of the 
profit and/or at the expense of reserves, provided that the Management Board is 
designated by the general meeting. With the approval of the Supervisory Board, the 
Management Board shall determine the conditions applicable to the aforementioned 
choices.

4.	
Dividends and other distributions will be made payable pursuant to a resolution of the 
Management Board within four weeks after adoption, unless the Management Board sets 
another date for payment.
5.

shareholders by placing those dividends or other distributions at the disposal of, or in 
accordance with the regulation of, Euroclear Netherlands.

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsi-
bilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht account-
antsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankeli-
jkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence 
regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- 
en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. 
MATERIALITY
Materiality
€ 3,9 million (2017: €2,4 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of pre-tax income (rounded)
Explanation
We applied pre-tax income as this benchmark is an 
important metric for the users of the financial statements 
of Flow Traders N.V.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our 
opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of € 260 thousand, which 
are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.

Our key audit matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signif-
icance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matter to 
the supervisory board. The key audit matter is not a comprehensive reflection of all matters 
discussed. 
This key audit matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this 
matter. 
The key audit matter is in line with prior year.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders N.V. Amsterdam is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of 
this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Flow Traders N.V. 
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities Flow Traders B.V. and Flow Traders 
U.S. LLC based on the relative size of these components. 
We have: 
◾
◾
Performed audit procedures ourselves for the component entity Flow Traders B.V.
◾
◾
Used the work of other auditors for auditing the component entity Flow Traders U.S. LLC
◾
◾
Performed specific audit procedures at other component entities
By performing the procedures mentioned above at component level, together with additional 
procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit 
evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Risk
Our audit approach
Key observations 
Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading (note 8 of the financial statements)
Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of financial assets and 
liabilities held for trading is based on internally determined 
theoretical prices, which are also used for quoting purposes. 
As such, valuation can be different than the closing prices at 
the various stock exchanges, for example due to market 
illiquidity and the opening hours of the stock exchanges.
The fair values recorded could include estimates which are 
subjective by nature. Therefore, we identified the valuation 
of financial assets and liabilities held for trading as 
a significant risk within our audit.
We obtained an understanding of the valuation process, 
including verifications done by the risk and middle office 
department. We performed sample testing on the valuation 
of individual positions by comparing the internally developed 
prices to external sources. 
We evaluated the fair value hierarchy of financial assets and 
liabilities held for trading and developments therein since 
prior year. 
Furthermore, we inspected the financial statements for 
compliance and consistency with IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 on 
disclosure requirements for financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading.
The method of fair value measurement and the underlying 
input for valuation of the financial assets and liabilities held 
for trading is reasonable as well as the fair value hierarchy and 
the disclosure.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V. on 19 May 2016, as of 
the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that date.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU 
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.
Description of responsibilities for the financial statements
Responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing 
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting 
frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose 
events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in the financial statements. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. 
Report on other information included in the annual report
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report 
contains other information that consists of:
◾
◾
Message of the Management Board 
◾
◾
Other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
◾
◾
Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements
◾
◾
Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained 
through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the 
other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, 
we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch 
Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of 
those performed in our audit of the financial statements.
Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Message 
of the Management Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other 
information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

◾
◾
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, 
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and 
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities 
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information 
or specific items.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional 
report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in 
this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine the key audit 
matter: this matter that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the 
matter is in the public interest.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means 
we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on 
our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism 
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements 
and independence requirements. Our audit included among others: 
◾
◾
Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control
◾
◾
Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
◾
◾
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
◾
◾
Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as 
a going concern
◾
◾
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures
