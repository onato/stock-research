Profile
Who we are
we are a leading global technology-enabled liquidity 
provider, specialized in exchange Traded Products (eTPs). 
our trading desks in europe, the americas and asia provide 
liquidity across all major exchanges, globally, 24 hours a day. 
with 346 employees (341 fTes) at year-end, we continued to 
build our organization in 2016. founded in 2004, we continue 
to cultivate the entrepreneurial, innovative and 
team-oriented culture that has been with us since the 
beginning.
What we do
as a technology company operating in a financial services 
industry, we use our proprietary technology platform to 
quote bid and ask prices in thousands of eTP listings, as well 
as similar financial products. we also provide liquidity to 
institutional counterparties off-exchange across all regions. 
liquidity provision makes markets more efficient and 
transparent, promoting better execution quality and lower 
overall trading costs for market participants.  
as a principal trading firm, we trade for our own account and 
own risk only. we do not have clients, nor do we provide any 
investment services or ancillary services to others. 
our strategies are designed to use information that is 
publicly available and we use fairly simple, non-controversial 
and transparent order types. we are a strong supporter of 
fair, transparent and orderly markets. we derive our net 
Trading Income from the small price differences at which 
investors are willing to trade eTPs or other financial 
instruments and those of the underlying or related financial 
instruments at which we hedge the resulting exposures. 
we do not have a directional opinion on the markets and aim 
to be hedged perfectly and instantaneously. This focus on 
risk management is at the heart of our organization, and our 
risk functions are closely integrated into our platform.

Message of the Management Board
2016 was our first full year as a listed company and our 
second best year since inception. while the markets – in terms 
of activity – never reached the levels they achieved in 2015, 
with a decline in volatility and trading activity by investors, we 
continued to focus on building for our future and expected 
growth. we continuously invest time and resources in further 
optimizing our infrastructure, expanding our already highly 
skilled and capable teams by hiring new talent, and growing 
the number of products we trade across all regions. at the 
same time, we fine-tuned the tools and processes required to 
be fully compliant amongst others with MifId II.
Market developments
The market in 2016 was slower than the previous year, with 
a more risk-averse attitude within capital markets leading to 
declining volumes in equities and increased eTP value 
traded in fixed income. a series of macro-economic 
developments, such as brexit, elections in the Us and Japan, 
and the federal funds rate decision path had an impact on 
trading appetite across the globe by investors being more 
sidelined towards these events. 
Capitalizing on opportunities
eTP assets-under-Management kept growing strongly over 
2016. while market conditions were slower, we increased our 
exposure to a broader range of products and markets, 
supported by a number of technological improvements. 
In the third quarter we established an Institutional Trading 
operation in the Us and asia, enabling us to expand our 
trading capacities and pricing power by providing liquidity 
off-exchange and with institutional counterparties directly. 
This brings our Us business more in line with our european 
franchise, where we are currently connected to over 550 
counterparties. In asia, we invested in new technologies and 
systems while strengthening our team to be able to 
successfully increase our product coverage in the region. 
These investments will help us better position ourselves for 
future growth in the fast growing eTP market, and we 
expect to see the results reflected positively in our net 
Trading Income during the 2017 course.
Preparing for MiFID II
at the same time we continued to prepare for the 
introduction of new regulations like MifId II, which will take 
effect at the beginning of 2018. The new regulations will help 
promote fairness and transparency in the financial industry. 
we believe they will benefit the eTP sector, creating more 
visibility into the size of the market and providing a level 
playing field in terms of requirements, processes, and 
controls.  
Appointment CFO
as of 1 october 2016 Marcel Jongmans joined the company 
as a Management board Member and chief financial officer. 
The supervisory board regards Marcel Jongmans to be very 
well qualified to fulfil this role and thinks he presents 
a natural fit within the Management board given his skills, 
previous role, experience, background and personality. 
during his first three months, Marcel Jongmans met many 
colleagues and is quickly accustomed within the company.  
The next steps
as we move through 2017, we will continue to focus on 
evolution and growth. we will roll out technological 
improvements at our asia business, open an office in hong 
Kong, concentrate on expanding in the Us, while delivering 
strong organic growth and aiming to provide liquidity in all 
eTPs, irrespective of the underlying asset class, in europe. 
with a view to diversification, we continuously assess 
whether we can provide liquidity into other product 
categories like, for example, currencies.
looking back on another successful year, we would like to 
thank not only the entire team at flow Traders, but also our 
shareholders and other stakeholders for their support and 
contribution.
Regards,
dennis dijkstra, Marcel Jongmans and sjoerd Rietberg

of at least 50% of the company’s net profits realized during

a distribution of (interim) dividends is subject to applicable 
rules and regulations, the articles of association of the 
company, the by-laws of the Management board, and the 
by-laws of the supervisory board.

and paid following the publication of our results for the first 
half of each year. however, there can be no assurance that in 
any given year a dividend will be proposed or declared.

Daniele Brupbacher handed over coverage to Michael Werner as per January

The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and 
timing thereof will depend on a number of factors, including 
future profits, financial conditions, general economic and 
business conditions, future prospects and such other factors 
as the Management board, subject to the approval of the 
supervisory board, may deem relevant as well as other legal 
and regulatory requirements. our intentions in relation to 
dividends are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control.
The Management board, subject to the approval of the 
supervisory board, may decide to make allocations to 
reserves and therefore decides how much of the profit will 
be allocated to reserves. The profits remaining shall be at 
the disposal of the General Meeting.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

We provide liquidity in exchange traded products 
(ETPs), which are baskets of securities made up of 
shares, bonds, or commodities. ETPs often track 
indices and, unlike most mutual funds, can be 
traded throughout the day on trading venues. 
We do this globally, enabling investors to buy and 
sell ETPs efficiently by quoting bid and ask prices 
under virtually all market circumstances.
Markets & Trends
Our business
we trade in well over 10,000 financial instruments, and have 
access to more than 100 trading venues in 35 countries 
around the world. we provide liquidity in almost 5,000 eTP 
listings on- and off-exchange.
off-exchange, we provide liquidity in eTPs on a request-
for-quote basis to over 550 institutional counterparties 
across the globe, including banks, asset managers, pension 
funds, insurance companies, family offices, hedge funds, 
and others in 35 countries and their number increases 
almost daily. besides eTPs, we provide liquidity in similar 
instruments, whose value is correspondingly affected by 
a change in the value of their underlying assets.
as a liquidity provider, we do not have an opinion on the 
market. In other words, our results don’t depend on the 
direction of market prices. we make our net Trading Income 
from the small price differences that investors are willing to 
buy or sell eTPs and other financial instruments, and the 
prices we pay or receive for the underlying or related 
financial instruments.
The ETP market
The popularity of eTPs continued to increase over the recent 
years. according to asset manager blackRock advisors, 
global eTP assets under Management (auM) grew from 
€ 453 billion in 2006 to € 3,323 billion by the end of 2016. 
and this growth is expected to continue, with sources such 
as blackRock, Pwc, boston consulting Group and eY 
predicting the market will more than double to € 6 trillion by 
2020, as investors continue to seek out low-cost passive 
investment strategies.1
we believe there are a number of reasons for this: one is that 
investors are attracted to the transparent nature of eTPs, 
which enables them to follow clearly how the underlying 
securities are performing. another is that eTPs are liquid and 
available at low costs, and can be bought and sold easily 
during market hours. a third reason is that eTPs can be 
composed of financial instruments from almost any asset 
class, sector or location, giving investors access to markets 
that would normally be difficult to reach.
Review of 2016
Global eTP markets continued to gain strength and grew by 
20 percent in 2016 measured in auM. annual global inflows 
of eTP auM were € 345 billion (2015: € 316 billion), driven by 
record investments in fixed income products and a recovery 
of equity products in 2h 2016. overall trading activity in 2016 
was rather limited compared to other years, as investors 
remained side-lined due to macro-economic developments, 
such as brexit and the Us elections. net inflows were high in 
fixed income products and throughout the year we saw 
some swings in flows in equity eTfs. These eTfs were 
subject to market developments which resulted in large 
outflows in 1h 2016, of which some returned in 2h 2016.

While MiFID II represents a considerable challenge, it 
also represents a signifi cant opportunity for fi rms to 
improve their organisation and way of doing 
business. What possibilities and opportunities does it 
offer Trading?
In general, MiFID II is designed to create more 
transparency in the market. Currently many 
liquidity providers, such as Flow Traders, are not 
visible to the outside world. Increased visibility will 
provide investors with a clearer overview of who 
they are trading with. For example, if an investor 
trades via a bank and the bank executes the trade 
via a liquidity provider like us, the investor may 
legitimately ask why the bank is still involved as 
a middleman. Why not trade directly with Flow 
Traders? Then of course there are the savings 
investors will make, as they currently have to pay 
banks a commission, and under MiFID II this 
commission needs to be clarifi ed. Additionally, 
many of the smaller trading fi rms will have to fi nd 
additional resources to implement and comply 
with the new requirements, while the banks might 
not be effi cient enough to easily implement the 
requirements. This could impact a level playing 
fi eld and the barriers to entry the markets. 
Consequently, we expect that MiFID II will make 
the market more effi cient, as market participants 
will essentially have to guarantee investors the 
best price. This means that investors will benefi t 
from sharper prices, and the fi rms delivering the 
best price will attract more business.
How has the Trading environment prepared for the 
introduction of MiFID II?
We’ve worked closely with the Compliance, Risk 
and Technology departments to develop 
feedback that the regulators could consider as 
they drafted the new regulations. This ensures 
that any new legislation reﬂ ects the actual market 
situation, improves the market spaces, and 
doesn’t stiﬂ e the market. So we were very active 
in the discussions. And we have also worked 
closely with the project management team 
internally to ensure that our systems are ready for 
the changes, and that the traders are aware of any 
issues that will affect them.
MiFID II introduces new rules that will apply to 
market makers that use algorithmic trading, 
including high frequency trading strategies. Can you 
explain how this will impact the Trading function?
Regulators believe that algorithmic trading has 
the potential to cause rapid and signifi cant market 
distortion. MiFID II introduces closer regulation 
and monitoring of algorithmic trading, imposing 
new and detailed requirements on algorithmic 
traders. We need to ensure we comply with all 
relevant regulations, while doing our work as 
a liquidity provider effi ciently by providing the 
markets – and ultimately the investors – with 
transparent prices.  I think MiFID II will enable us to 
continue to achieve that.
Does Trading face any challenges as a result of 
MiFID II?
Greater transparency on pricing could lead to 
investors looking to do business with other market 
participants, so for us that could certainly lead to 
bringing more professional counterparties 
onboard, highlighting that we are providing the 
best prices in the markets. So we expect that 
MiFID II will make the market less attractive for 
some of our current competitors and new market 
entrants. This will provide an opportunity to 
expand into their market position. A lot of it will 
depend on how well fi rms adapt to the new 
regulatory landscape.
What will MiFID II deliver?
Will there be more or less trading? It’s diffi cult to 
say. It will likely increase transparency in all asset 
classes, especially in those that are currently 
harder to track, such as FX and bond markets. 
In general, as a relatively small company we are 
ﬂ exible and very well suited to a wide range of 
changes in market circumstances. I’m confi dent 
we will adapt well to the changes MiFID II will bring 
to the markets.

the number of products traded, the number of venues in the 
Us and the number of counterparties we are connected to.
In asia we continue to increase our participation in the 
markets where we are already active and expand into new 
markets. at the same time, we remain focused on markets 
that are potentially opening up, such as china, by capitalizing 
on our experience and increasing our business development 
capacities. In order to facilitate our future growth, we will 
open an office in hong Kong to increase our footprint and 
visibility in the region, to support our Institutional Trading 
and to confirm our role in the eTP ecosystem in the region.
In general, we believe growth can accelerate in all regions in 
the coming years, as the markets in europe further develop 
electronic trading, and given that the shift to electronic 
trading has penetrated less than half the market in europe 
so far. In the asian markets electronic trading is still rather 
limited and regulation is still very local. In the americas we 
expect that markets will respond to further changes to 
regulation.
Products
ETPs
eTPs, the main products that we trade, are often compared 
to mutual funds mainly because they’re both baskets of 
shares, bonds, or commodities. however, that’s where the 
similarity ends. Unlike most mutual funds most eTPs simply 
track an index without trying to beat such indices. eTPs have 
open-ended fund structures rather than closed-end and, 
unlike mutual funds, can be continuously bought and sold 
on trading venues during trading hours and off-exchange 
after trading hours. 
20165, while the total eTP value traded at our singapore 
office was € 32 billion.
High growth market
we see significant opportunities for growth, driven by the 
widely expected expansion of the eTP industry. This is down 
to a number of changes within the asset management 
industry, including: 
 
◾
The continuing shift to global electronic trading, which 
cuts costs and maximizes efficiency and transparency;
 
◾
a shift in asset growth from active strategies to more 
cost-effective, passive strategies;
 
◾
Increasing eTP adoption globally among institutions, 
intermediaries and retail investors;
 
◾
long-term shifts driven by regulators looking to 
increase financial stability and transparency, such as 
MifId II.
To take advantage of this expected growth, we aim to 
expand our presence further in all areas of eTP trading 
in all regions.
In europe we continue to grow our presence on the different 
venues and grow the number of counterparties. we have 
now established a connection with virtually all issuers active 
in europe and we continued to grow our Institutional 
counterparty-base substantially.
In the americas, where our current market share is relatively 
limited but growing, we believe there is significant growth 
potential in fixed income eTfs, developed market equity 
eTfs and institutional trading going forward. we will expand

flows in fixed income were € 105 billion (2015: € 84 billion) 
signifying a 25 percent growth that can be largely attributed 
to investors’ appetite for better investments in fixed income 
themes through eTfs.2
Global coverage
we trade globally from three offices, in new York, 
amsterdam and singapore. The largest eTP market is in the 
United states, where total eTP value traded (on-exchange 
and off-exchange) was € 18.3 trillion in 20163. our new York 
office’s total eTP value traded was € 190 billion in 2016, the 
highest level for flow Traders Us since inception. This was 
partially the result of the start of the Institutional Trading 
department during 3Q 2016, following the grant of the 
fInRa membership.
The eMea eTP market, the world’s second largest, had 
a total eTP value traded of € 973 billion in 20164. our total 
eTP value traded at our amsterdam office was € 418 billion 
in 2016.  
In aPac, the eTP market is still fragmented, with large 
differences in trading volumes, trading costs, regulation and 
maturity across the financial markets. additionally, the 
volumes traded in the aPac region are dominated by the 
top-10 most traded eTf products, as those 10 determine 
65-70% of the total market volumes. The total eTP value 
traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) was € 2 trillion in

What are the main areas in which Risk Management 
has prepared for the introduction of MiFID II?
Our main focus areas have been on pre-trade 
controls, such as price bands, maximum order size, 
and repeated automated execution throttles. 
At the same time, the regulations require us to 
perform real-time trade monitoring for signs of 
disorderly trading, as well as implementing 
post-trade controls, trade reporting, trade 
publication, and change management from a Risk 
Management perspective. 
Although MiFID II itself is a completely new 
regulation, we already had many of the 
requirements in place through guidelines, best 
practice procedures, or because of earlier 
regulations. We haven’t had to prepare from 
scratch.
What challenges or opportunities does MiFID II pose 
for Flow Traders and others? 
In terms of challenges, capturing all the order data 
is one of the main ones. For example, we could send 
out over 100 million orders to the market each day. 
These have to be captured. And this doesn’t even 
take into account the related market data that we 
need to process each day. We are the perfect 
example of a fi rm that faces big data challenges, 
having to store all of our order history to comply 
with the regulations. Another issue is that we’re not 
alone in being more heavily regulated. Other 
market participants – such as exchanges, venues, 
and brokers – are also impacted by MiFID II, and all 
have their own data requests. This is why close 
cooperation along the chain is so important. 
For example, exchanges are required to conduct 
a yearly due diligence. The exchange has to collect 
more information from market participants, and 
since we are trading on more than 100 venues, this 
could signifi cantly impact our workload. However, 
we are in close contact with the exchanges and 
discuss the interpretation of the regulations. 
Sharing information helps us fi nd the best solution.
In terms of opportunities, it is diffi cult to predict 
what they may be for such a comprehensive new 
regulation. However, the general purpose of 
MiFID II is market transparency. And as a market 
maker, transparency is one of the things we most 
focus on. When the entire market becomes more 
transparent, more order ﬂ ow should become 
visible, benefi tting fi rms such as Flow Traders. 
In addition, if more information is available we 
could improve the pricing of our instruments, 
which will make us even more competitive, 
benefi tting investors. 
How involved have you been in preparing other 
departments for MiFID II’s introduction?
We’ve been very involved since day one. We work 
closely with the Compliance department to 
interpret and translate the regulations into 
day-to-day business requirements. We’re currently 
working with the Technology department to create 
the required tooling and we also have people in the 
Risk department developing some of the software 
we will need. We are already a very risk-aware fi rm, 
so in many ways we view these regulations as being 
an extension of our normal business practices.
What do you see as being the main benefi ts of 
MiFID II to the company and industry?
Regulators are getting to know us even better, and 
have a better understanding of our industry. 
And MiFID II is the fi rst time that the regulators 
have specifi cally mentioned high-frequency and 
algorithmic trading in their regulations. This is 
positive. We are seeing more acceptance and 
understanding of our business and the current 
electronic markets, and this is reﬂ ected in the 
regulators’ position. We are different from banks, 
and therefore regulators should not copy-paste 
regulations from the banking industry and apply 
them directly to us. We view ourselves as 
a technology company operating in the fi nancial 
sector. We believe in having an open, mature 
relationship with all market participants, and one 
aspect of that is having regular discussions with 
regulators to explain what we are doing and where 
our challenges lie.
And how comfortable are you with the introduction 
of MiFID II?
The most diffi cult issue will be ensuring everyone 
makes the deadline, and being able to show the 
regulators that we have properly documented all 
of the required processes. Aside from that, I am 
very comfortable with where we are. We are very 
much on top of the regulations so the main 
unknowns for us are the external market 
participants.

Secondary market
The secondary market is where eTP trading takes place 
between market participants, similar to the trading of 
ordinary shares, at market-determined prices. secondary 
market participants include institutional and retail investors, 
liquidity providers and authorized participants. secondary 
markets include exchanges and other automated trading 
venues, as well as off-exchange trading between market 
participants such as large institutional investors.
The role of Flow Traders
we have two main roles in the eTP ecosystem. The first is as 
a liquidity provider. In this role, we help maintain and 
improve the overall transparency and efficiency of the 
ecosystem, by quoting bid and ask prices for eTPs on trading 
venues, as well as off-exchange to institutional investors, 
that market participants can trade against. by providing 
liquidity we make it easier for investors to buy and sell eTPs 
at a price that should reflect the (relation with the) current 
price of the underlying asset, and contribute to lower 
trading costs.
another role we play in the eTP landscape is as an 
authorized Participant (aP). we have aP-agreements in 
place with all the major eTP issuers, these agreements link 
the primary and the secondary eTP market and allow us to 
either create or redeem the eTPs.
Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs)
eTns are a type of unsecured, unsubordinated debt security 
issued by an underwriting bank. The returns of eTns are 
based on the performance of the index being tracked. 
for example, the iPath s&P 500 VIX short-Term futures 
Index TR eTn would track the s&P 500 VIX short-Term 
futures volatility index.
The ETP ecosystem
The eTP ecosystem is made up of a number of participants 
who together make eTP investing and trading possible. 
These include: investors, eTP issuers, exchanges and other 
trading venues and authorized participants, who can also act 
as liquidity providers, such as flow Traders. The eTP 
ecosystem can be further divided into two markets: the 
primary market and the secondary market.
Primary market
Interaction in the primary market takes place between 
authorized participants and the issuers, who either issue or 
cancel eTPs. This is done in reaction to market demand and 
is called the creation and redemption process. authorized 
participants can create eTPs with the issuer by transferring 
the underlying assets (or cash equivalent) to the issuer in 
return for a corresponding number of newly issued eTPs. 
This increases the eTP’s auM. In this way, the issuance of 
eTPs through authorized participants provides the issuers 
with access to a broad investor market without having to 
support a complex and costly trading infrastructure which 
would be non-core to their business. Redemption is the 
reverse of the creation process: the authorized participant 
transfers eTPs to their issuer in exchange for the underlying 
assets (or a cash equivalent). The issuer then cancels the 
eTPs it received. This decreases the eTP’s auM. 
They provide investors with exposure to a wide variety of 
underlying assets, ranging from eTPs that replicate the 
composition of a particular equity index, to those that 
provide investors with exposure to assets in specific sectors 
or countries, to commodities, or to currencies. eTPs also 
enable investors to create and manage diversified 
investment portfolios in an efficient manner,  
as well as enabling them to switch exposures at any given 
moment during trading days. within eTPs there are broadly 
three main categories in which we trade: 
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
This category is traded the most, compared to eTcs and 
eTns. eTfs derive their value from shares or bonds held in 
proportion to an index. for example, a euro stoxx 50 eTf 
would track the same shares as the euro stoxx 50 index  
in approximately the same proportions. fixed-income eTfs 
derive their value from a portfolio of debt instruments. 
for example, bonds included in the barclays Us Treasury 1-3 
Year Term Index. eTfs are the most widespread among eTPs 
as measured by auM.
Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs)
eTcs typically derive their value from a commodity index, 
such as the bloomberg commodity Index, although in some 
cases they derive it from just a single commodity, such as 
gold or oil, or a certain currency. for example, the sPdR 
Gold shares eTc tracks the value of physical gold. eTcs may 
hold physical assets, but exposure can also be held through 
derivatives of the underlying commodity, in combination 
with cash.

Liquidity Provider
Leading liquidity provider
we are recognized by the eTP industry as a leader in eTP 
liquidity provision. for the last nine years, we have won the 
‘eTf Market Maker europe’ award in the Global eTf awards. 
we received the equivalent distinction in aPac as ‘eTf 
Market Maker asia-Pacific’ in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. 
flow Traders has also been voted best Trading house for 
eTfs in the eTf Risk european Rankings in three consecutive 
years - 2013, 2014 and 2015. finally, eTf express awarded 
flow Traders with the title ‘best asia-Pacific Market Maker’ 
in 2013 and 2016 and ‘best european eTf Market Maker’ for 
2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. we consistently rank in the top 
three in terms of market share of eTP value traded on 
europe’s five largest eTP trading venues: deutsche börse, 
borsa Italiana, euronext, sIX and lse. In terms of total 
on-exchange eTP value traded in europe, we hold a leading 
position.
Pricing
Pricing ETPs accurately 
being able to accurately price the eTPs that we provide 
liquidity in is vital to the success of our business. Get it 
wrong, and we lose money or a trade goes to a competitor. 
our experience in establishing the pricing relationship 
between the eTPs and the underlying assets in a variety of 
market conditions means we can offer competitive bid and 
ask prices, while still covering our trading costs and locking 
in transaction profit. we achieve this using pre-set hedging 
strategies, which (where possible) instantly reduce our 
market exposure, creating a market-neutral position. 
and it’s these hedging strategies that enable us to trade 
eTPs in such a way that our net Trading Income is unaffected 
by any price movements of the underlying or related 
securities. 
Cutting edge proprietary technology 
platform
we are a financial technology company. as such, technology 
lies at the heart of the business, enabling us to provide 
liquidity in a variety of market environments across the 
globe. we trade using proprietary and scalable software 
with the vast majority of our applications developed 
in-house. These include pricing and trading software, market 
data processing tools, pre-trade risk controls, and other risk 
and compliance tools. This is the main reason that our 
Technology department makes up around one-third of our 
total staff.
one of our software platform’s core features is its modular 
design, which allows us to rapidly test and implement 
ongoing enhancements. This also means we can easily and 
cost-effectively expand our coverage of securities, asset 
classes, and geographical markets as we grow the business.
In 2016 our total technology expenses grew 27% to support 
the improvements in our infrastructure and the growth in 
number of trading venues. In total our technology expenses 
were 48% of the total fixed expenses in 2016. Including 
salaries this would be 66%, showing our focus on technology 
as part of flow Traders’ business model
Real-time risk management 
we manage risk effectively across the company. within the 
trading environment we reduce our risk by monitoring our 
trades and positions, market exposure, portfolio efficiency, 
and liquidity on a real-time basis. our risk management 
system is fully integrated with our trading platform, 
analyzing pricing data and ensuring that our order activity is 
conducted within pre-determined trading and position limits 
indepdently. at the same time the system reconciles internal 
transaction records against those of our prime brokers and 
exchanges where possible. off-exchange we use strict risk 
management approval and monitoring procedures for

the value of products we trade and revenue capture is the 
net margin we capture per trade after the corresponding 
exposure has been hedged. our risk profile is characterized 
by having no opinion on market movement or direction. 
Realizing this ambition will involve:
Our strategy 
we will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing to grow 
our business incrementally. This should result in increasing 
our net Trading Income (nTI), while maintaining our desired 
risk profile, controlling costs, and securing and attracting 
the right talent. Increasing our nTI involves increasing the 
institutional trading counterparties. additionally, we settle 
almost all of our off-exchange trades through delivery-
versus-payment, which means that the delivery of securities 
occurs simultaneously with payment by the buyer, thus 
limiting counterparty risk. for more information, please 
refer to the our Risk Management chapter.
Strategy
Our strategic ambition
our ambition is to be the leading global eTPs-focused 
liquidity provider. 
Our market
we operate in a highly competitive market that is changing 
rapidly. It is characterized by heightened regulation and an 
ever-increasing focus on technology. Yet the market’s core 
function remains the same: transferring risk between 
market participants. This is where we add value. our focus 
will continue to be on providing liquidity in the fast growing 
eTPs market, and we are striving to trade all eTPs. 
Our business principles
our business principles are being flexible, agile and 
improving continuously. To be successful, we recognize that 
we need to perform well across all areas of the business. 
achieving this involves diligently studying the markets and 
our responses to them, and using our resources where they 
have the greatest impact. The outcome of this process 
defines whether or not we have a competitive edge.

Acquisitions
we focus on incremental growth. although we will not 
exclude any possibilities where it concerns M&a activity, any 
opportunity would have to outweigh the integration and 
cultural issues that could potentially arise.
Financial overview
Net Trading Income
The 2016 macro-economic topics such as brexit referendum 
and Us elections kept investors side-lined in the run-up to 
these events with a focus on more liquid products which 
generally trade with tighter spreads. This affected our net 
Trading Income, which decreased to €250 million (2015: 
€ 304.7 million), although our eTP value traded increased to 
€640 billion (2015: €603 billion). Therefore, our revenue 
capture was impacted by the shift to highly liquid products 
and less periods of highly volatility. compared to 2015 our 
consolidated revenue capture decreased to 3.9 bps (2015: 
5.1 bps).
Market volatility
In 2016 market volatility declined profoundly to levels close 
to record lows, with moments of heightened volatility and 
market activity after the results of the brexit referendum 
and the Us elections.
Operational expenses
our fi xed operational expenses were in line with the growth 
of the company whereby we kept investing in our technology 
infrastructure. Part of this development were the 
write-downs of tangible assets in the fi rst half of 2016. 
we were able to keep our ebITda margin at a comfortable 
47.5 percent in 2016 (2015: 51.5 percent, adjusted for the IPo 
costs).
Capital base
during the year we continued to maintain a strong, stable 
capital base, comfortably exceeding our regulatory and 
prime broker capital requirements. we paid out € 0.55 
interim dividend in september 2016 and propose to pay 
€ 0.70 as a fi nal dividend, to return a total of €1.25 in 
dividend to our shareholders over 2016.
Growth
flow Traders continued to grow in 2016. we increased our 
institutional counterparties globally to more than 550, 
increased the number of products traded and increased the 
number of venues we are connected to, to over a 100. 
To facilitate this growth, we continued to grow the business 
during the year across all regions, resulting in an increase in 
the number of fTes to 341 by year-end (2015: 268).

How has the IT environment prepared for the 
introduction of MiFID II?
We began by working closely with the Compliance 
department to prepare for the changes. 
This enabled us to develop a very thorough 
understanding of the regulatory requirements in 
general, and a detailed understanding of the IT 
requirements specifi cally. Many of these 
requirements focus on data availability, our ability 
to create reports, and so on. One of the key 
aspects of MiFID II is providing the regulators with 
unfettered access to our data, so we reduce the 
risk of data loss by storing all of our trades on local 
servers and distributing the information 
simultaneously between offi ces. And because we 
are trading on more than 100 venues we are 
producing and processing a huge amount of data. 
We need to balance this vast data load with speed 
of delivery, as we have to be able to report at a set 
time each day.
What are the main challenges you are facing/have 
faced?
In addition to cost, the main issues are time and 
resource planning. Transforming a written 
regulation into a physical change that requires 
additional reporting, data backup and storage, 
and hardware upgrades, requires disciplined 
planning and puts a strain on the departments. 
At the same time, we need to ensure we are hiring 
and training people of the right calibre, while also 
dealing with the day-to-day issues that arise from 
trading on an expanding number of markets and 
venues. So there is a lot going on. The biggest 
advantage we have is the strength of our business 
model and the very talented, professional team 
we have built up.
What have you had to change or adapt within the IT 
framework, if anything?
I would call it evolution rather than change. 
We have complied with regulatory requirements 
since 2004, and since that time we have developed 
a very robust and ﬂ exible technology platform 
and department. For our technology platform, the 
main development was increasing the ﬂ exibility of 
data capturing and securing data storage, as the 
regulators demand data in a variety of formats. 
This of course is possible, but we need to adjust 
our framework to enable it.
Do you think MiFID II will result in an increased use 
of technology for trading?
Absolutely. We rely heavily on technology at every 
level in this business, and these regulations mean 
we need to focus even more on developing the 
right technology solutions. In the electronic 
markets the goal is to make use of the best 
technology available, and we work closely with 
software developers and hardware manufacturers 
to look at what they are developing and whether it 
can help us. Our focus is on developing systems 
that give us a competitive advantage, but which 
are robust and fail safe. Something might be very 
fast, but is it reliable? The challenge is fi nding the 
balance between reliability and performance. 
One of our great strengths is we operate 
a Technology department, we integrate IT, Quality 
Assurance and Development in the process of 
software delivery. We cross-pollinate and focus 
on coming up with lateral solutions, which has 
enabled us to be more ﬂ exible, especially on 
MiFID II and other regulatory items.

Our success is driven by a combination of smart 
trading strategies, state-of-the-art proprietary 
technology and prudent risk management. 
Our people are the cornerstone of our ability to 
deliver on these items. This is why we aim to 
recruit and retain the best talent available.
Recruiting
How we recruit
we are looking for the best talent available, regardless of 
their gender, age, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. 
To fi nd people with the unique skill sets needed for a global 
liquidity provider we recruit across the globe. we visit 
campuses in India, australia, singapore, the Us and across 
europe. we advertise and search globally on multiple 
platforms. our offi ces are all growing, and we are looking to 
hire as many qualifi ed applicants as we can fi nd. however, 
our selection standards remain high – our candidates need 
to go through a number of tests and interviews, with less 
than 1% of applicants for Trading positions ultimately 
receiving a job offer.
we recruit for all disciplines. Junior traders are typically 
recruited straight from university. although our traders have 
a varied educational background, they share a strong 
numerical aptitude, which is why a numerical test is an 
important part of the selection procedure. candidates for 
roles other than trading are qualifi ed specialists who have 
relevant work experience. we make very little use of 
contractors or temporary employees.
Retaining staff
Our Offices
all our offi ces are designed to provide a pleasant and 
ergonomically sound place to work. offi ces are fl ooded 
with light and have a great interior with ergonomically 
optimized furniture. In addition, to give our people the 
opportunity to perform at their best, we offer healthy 
breakfast and lunch options, have our own in-house gym 
facilities and bar in amsterdam, singapore and new York,

and organize great company trips and parties. and we do not 
only use our newly-designed bar for after work gatherings, 
but also for recruiting events and quarterly staff updates. 
The bar’s authentic feel and design, which contrasts with the 
sleek, modern, white-and-red interior of our office, has 
triggered many positive comments from visitors. we believe 
these benefits are important to maintain a healthy and 
happy workforce and to stimulate bonding and connections 
beyond the direct circle of colleagues and stimulate 
teamwork across the whole company.
Onboarding
we are a fast growing company. In 2016 we hired over 100 
new joiners, a 29% increase in the number of employees. 
our new colleagues join us from all parts of the world. 
To make sure they feel at home quickly we offer full 
relocation support for everyone moving to our offices from 
abroad. we help with finding a home, applying for a visa and 
getting to know the local culture. In 2016 we hosted our first 
spouses event aimed at helping our employees’ partners 
settle in and find their way. and all international employees 
are given the opportunity to attend dutch language classes.
our new hires in Trading and Technology start with an 
intensive introduction program, bringing them up to speed 
with our way of working and training them in the specific 
skills they need to do their job well. all junior traders – 
including those hired in asia and the Us – begin their global 
training program at our offices in amsterdam.
Training and rotation
at flow Traders, we help our employees shape their own 
future. for example, we like to give our employees the 
chance to transfer between our offices and experience life 
and work elsewhere. we offer all of our employees training 
opportunities, aimed at either improving function-specific 
skills or for their own personal development. and most of 
our managers are ‘home-grown’, having developed into their 
positions after a numbers of years working with the 
company. They set an example and act as an inspiration for 
new hires, illustrating the career paths open to them.
Remuneration
we reward our uniquely skilled employees with an attractive 
combination of fixed and variable pay. when awarding 
variable compensation, we look beyond one’s individual 
results or direct area of responsibility. The variable element 
depends on company performance, individual performance, 
and one’s contribution to the long term success of the 
company as a whole. we use this compensation structure as 
an important tool to stimulate team work and risk 
awareness and to reward performance. for example, 
awarding variable remuneration and payment of deferred 
variable remuneration depends on the future profitability of 
the company, which means we only award variable 
remuneration, or pay deferred remuneration, if there is 
sufficient profit and capital to do so. 
In 2016, the company-wide average compensation paid per 
employee was approximately €277,000. Variable 
remuneration amounted to around 70% of total 
compensation in 2016. In 2016 19 employees (including 
management board) were awarded remuneration of 
€1 million or more (2015: 32). 
Open, informal and diverse culture
our work environment is a reflection of the things we 
believe in. we believe that it is more important how you 
perform than what you wear. so our employees dress 
comfortably for work – jeans, t-shirts and sneakers are 
common. we believe that what someone says is more 
important than who says it. we believe that the 
contributions of our team-members are crucial to the 
success of the company. we believe that two people know 
more than one, and that people can have great ideas even in 
areas other than their core expertise. Therefore, we 
welcome and encourage everyone to share their opinions. 
anyone with a good idea, be it in his own area of expertise or 
another, will be encouraged to put this forward. This is part 
of our open and collaborative culture.
our employees include people from different backgrounds 
and nationalities. we have economists, engineers, computer 
scientists, mathematicians, lawyers and physicists among 
our employees. we harbor people from 36 different 
nationalities. This diversity ensures different viewpoints are 
brought into discussions, and we believe this leads to better, 
more innovative outcomes for the company (2015: 32).

Sustainability statement
Our activities influence the society we live in. As a liquidity 
provider we are active on global financial markets and we 
contribute to transparency and the pricing process, enabling 
market participants to invest at fair prices and lower costs. Our 
activities contribute to sustainable employment and 
technological innovation in our society and we are committed 
to full compliance and integrity. We seek to limit our 
environmental footprint and contribute to our society and 
immediate vicinity. 
we are aware of our impact on society while executing our 
business strategy. four themes summarize our interaction 
with society: 
1 
we offer liquidity on financial markets;
2 
we offer sustainable employment;
3 
we are committed to full compliance and integrity;
4 
we are aware of our impact on the environment and 
involved in society and our immediate vicinity.
1.  We offer liquidity on financial markets
we contribute to transparency and effective operation of 
global financial markets by providing liquidity to markets 
globally. we facilitate that thousands of exchange Traded 
Products (eTPs) and similar products can be traded across 
the world’s markets, by continuously quoting bid and ask 
prices. as an innovative segment of global financial markets, 
eTPs have introduced efficiencies and cut investment costs 
substantially for a wide range of investors, from pension 
funds to retail investors. Increased liquidity, higher 
execution quality, and lower overall trading costs are just 
some of the benefits that liquidity providers, such as flow 
Traders, offer through these innovative financial products 
compared to more traditional investment products. 
our role is to enable trading in widely diversified investment 
products accessible and transparent to anyone at any time, 
allowing end investors to invest with less costs and thus 
potentially higher returns. as a result, over the years, trading 
costs have dropped dramatically and access to transparent 
and inexpensive investment products for anyone, and not 
only the happy few, has never been more efficient. 
This benefits institutional investors, individual investors and, 
ultimately, society at large.
Stakeholder dialogue
we enter the public dialogue with full transparency. 
our contributions to the regulatory dialogue are typically 
made public and we are always willing to discuss what we do, 
and how that impacts the world around us. we have 
extensive dialogues with interest groups, including those 
focusing on transparency, institutional and retail 
shareholder interests, academia and students, local 
governments, regulators and anyone else who has an 
interest in what we do, and how we do it. we commit to being 
approachable and fully transparent with the goal to promote 
fairness, transparency and orderly functioning of the 
financial markets.
2. We offer sustainable employment
by creating and retaining high quality jobs we help develop 
a stable and trusting working environment that benefits our 
people, our business, and society. since we started in 2004, 
our goal has been to foster a culture that encourages 
innovation, entrepreneurialism and risk-awareness, while 
focusing on drive, teamwork and ownership. by developing 
talent in-house and maintaining a committed and 
substantial employee shareholder base, we strengthen the 
internal bonds and help create a loyal, forward-looking 
team. we invest in employees for the long run. 
we encourage our people to move between offices 
internationally, to share ideas and best practices across the 
company, while experiencing life in different cultures. 
although our business does not directly affect human rights 
issues, we are strong proponents of ensuring fair and equal 
treatment for all and expect the same from our employees, 
relationships and stakeholders.
Diversity
we also believe that a diverse workforce can supply 
a greater variety of ideas and provide better solutions to the 
challenges we face. we have a long-standing policy of 
recruiting and retaining the best talent available, regardless 
of their gender, ethnicity, faith or sexual preference. we are 
committed to providing equal employment opportunities to 
all qualified job applicants. as a result, we employ people 
from 36 nationalities across our offices. The composition of 
our workforce tracks the outflow of the education system in 
the various roles on offer at flow Traders. we strongly

conducting business ethically and honestly. we have issued 
a code of conduct which forms part of our employment 
documentation. This code of conduct can be found on our 
website.
Anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
we have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering (aMl) policies in place that apply to all our staff. 
we expect our counterparties, business partners, 
intermediaries, contractors and subcontractors to adhere to 
the same standards. we believe that the risk of bribery or 
corruption is very limited as we do not hold or manage client 
money or funds. we trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. we do not do maintain 
production facilities or source raw materials. nevertheless, 
staff receive training in respect of anti-bribery, 
anti-corruption and aMl practices.
Key to our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy is that 
officials or counterparties may never be placed in an 
Employee dialogue
we take good care of our people and stakeholders. 
we ensure a high quality working environment, fair 
treatment and equal remuneration principles for all our 
staff, including contractors, regardless of gender, tenure or 
personal factors. all employees and contractors have 
unrestricted, direct access to senior management and are 
regularly informed and consulted about key developments. 
People are encouraged to speak their minds to help make 
flow Traders better. Information travels freely and is not 
restricted unless we need to protect overriding interests, 
such as those concerning regulations, commercial 
sensitivities or to protect our intellectual property. 
In addition, we hold regular employee surveys, including for 
the survey by ‘Great Place to work’, in order to hear our 
employees’ views on how the company is doing and their 
experiences in their day-to-day workplace.
3.  We are committed to full compliance 
and integrity
flow Traders is a strong proponent of effective, efficient and 
equal regulation and contributes to the regulatory dialogue 
in our key jurisdictions as we want markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
we commit to complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations that apply to us, wherever we operate, including 
in respect of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Integrity 
and transparency is central to the way we run our business, 
from our Management board and supervisory board to all 
our staff, regardless of their role. The company encourages 
an open culture within its organization and expects its 
employees to comply with applicable laws, regulations and 
internal policies. each employee is responsible for 
encourage women to apply for any function within the firm, 
particularly when they have a background in fields that 
traditionally have a higher proportion of male employees.
Remuneration
we believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, all employees, in any role, in any office, are 
entitled to receiving a bonus relative to their contribution to 
the firm as a whole. we are transparent about both how we 
pay our people and how much we pay them, including 
management. we have a straight-forward remuneration 
policy that permits variable pay only when actual profit is 
made. and because variable remuneration is deferred to 
a large extent, it remains at risk of forfeiture in the case that 
we sustain a loss. we believe this is the strongest incentive 
for sustainable, risk-aware behaviour for all our staff. 
In addition, we promote employee shareholding, particularly 
at the more senior levels. This aligns the interests of the 
company with those of our employees by creating ‘skin in 
the game’. for more details please refer to the sections  
our People and Remuneration.
Education
we want our employees to keep developing themselves in 
order to improve our business as a whole on a day-by-day 
basis. Therefore we provide excellent training to our 
employees. for example, in the Trading and Technology 
departments, new joiners follow rigorous initial training. 
Throughout the year all of our employees receive training at 
our newly introduced flow Traders academy, covering a wide 
variety of subjects including on culture, technology, 
regulatory developments and trading for non-traders.

Fair taxation
we are committed to being good corporate citizens of the 
communities we operate in. we pay taxes where they are 
due and subscribe to fair taxation, both in terms of 
corporate taxes and wage taxation. In 2016 we paid total 
taxes of €62.1 million which is 25% of our net Trading 
Income.

uncomfortable position. no gifts or favours may lead (or 
have the appearance to lead) to obligations or embarrass 
any recipient, and no gifts or favours of any substantial 
value may be given to authorities. facilitation payments are 
not permitted. we provide clear and recurring guidance in 
that respect. as part of our constant monitoring, all 
expenses and gifts relating to external parties are checked 
by senior managers of the firm and employees have to state 
what the purpose of an expense was and who was the 
recipient.
Whistle-blowers
on top of our very strong culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have an elaborate whistle-blower 
Policy in place for all staff and relevant contractors, 
approved by the Management board and supervisory board. 
employees are free to raise issues and have the 
responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, or any 
reasonable suspicions. 
circumstances may arise that cause an employee to feel 
unsecure or unsafe to the extent that they may not want to 
use the usual reporting lines. The company provides 
employees with a safe way of reporting misconduct within 
its organization and offers adequate protection. 
The whistle-blower Policy has wide applications, including in 
respect of topics such as fraud, market abuse, corruption, 
anti-money laundering, theft, bribery and any other 
structural misconduct that threatens the integrity and 
proper business conduct of flow Traders. The whistle-
blower Policy provides whistle-blowers with anonymity, 
confidentiality, and the company will not impose sanctions 
on disclosure (or affect an employee’s position) unless the 
employee is involved in the issue that is being reported.
as set out in the our Governance chapter, flow Traders 
operates a fair, transparent and straightforward tax policy. 
we believe this is an important part of being a sustainable 
business and in delivering long-term value to all of the 
company’s stakeholders, including the tax authorities in 
countries whose infrastructure and facilities we benefit 
from. we do not use aggressive tax structuring or tax 
havens. we entered into a covenant with the dutch Tax 
authority for horizontal supervision (horizontal toezicht). 
This allows the dutch Tax authority and ourselves to 
pro-actively manage our relationship and discuss any tax 
items timely, transparently and professionally.

and their colleagues. for example, one of our employees 
collects toys for parents who are unable to provide presents 
to their children during the festive season and a large 
number of employees donated money or toys to support 
this initiative. additionally, in 2016 we sponsored the 
‘newTechKids’ project, which is designed to provide 
computer science classes to children ranging from ages 7 to 
12. our employees also take part in sports events to raise 
awareness and donations for a range of different charities. 
at the beginning of 2017 a group of eight employees climbed 
Kilimanjaro to raise money for the charity war child. In 2016, 
we sponsored emma children’s hospital by participating in 
their Racing for emma event.
Dilemmas
In our daily activities we sometimes encounter dilemmas 
where we weigh our societal impact against business benefits. 
We find them mostly in the intersection of regulations and 
entrepeneurship, being a listed company. Apart from having 
internal rules and regulations such as the Code of Conduct and 
the Whistle-blower Policy, we try to assess and resolve these 
dilemmas by applying common sense and remaining aware of 
our role within society. 
For example: while we seek profit by trading in a highly 
competitive environment, we feel that we must leverage our 
knowledge and our position as a market participant to 
safeguard fair orderly and transparent markets for others. 
More specifically, we see purpose in protecting retail investor 
interests in these markets. Therefore, we spend considerable 
resources and efforts to address such outside interests in our 
regulatory dialogue as it improves market quality for everyone, 
including more vulnerable participants.
4.  We are involved in society and our 
immediate vicinity
Environmental footprint
while our activities do not involve production, use, 
processing or transport of physical goods, sustainable 
business is important to us. Many of our employees live 
reasonably close to our offices, limiting travel. we seek to 
limit our energy use and co2 emission to take care of our 
environment. for example, when refurbishing our offices we 
sought to use more environmental friendly solutions for 
lighting and water consumption. we regularly review 
opportunities to compensate or limit our footprint, for 
instance by applying greener alternatives and perform 
annual energy audits in order to assess and reduce our 
impact on our environment.
Societal commitment and charity
It is important to us to contribute to initiatives that 
contribute to society. we support a number of charities, not 
only financially but also by offering access to knowledge 
and experience that we have available. our people feel 
empowered to support charitable initiatives, which has 
always been part of our working culture. we engage in 
community giving throughout the year, and across our 
offices. we do this by supporting our people in fund raising 
activities by giving time or access to our network, by 
providing guidance to help them having as great an impact 
as possible, and by contributing financially. for example, at 
the end of 2016 we asked each employee to donate €500 to 
a charity of their choice. as a result, more than 150 
charitable organizations received donations. 
Individual employees have also initiated support of an 
increasing number of charities with support of the company

Can you provide a short description of the 
relationship between FIA EPTA & Flow Traders?
The European Principal Traders Association (FIA 
EPTA) was established in 2011. We represent 29 
firms in Europe who have no external customers 
and trade with their own capital and for their own 
risk. Our purpose is to communicate, with one 
voice, our members’ opinions and ideas to 
legislators and regulators so that they can better 
understand trading practices. Flow Traders is one 
of the founders of FIA EPTA and remains  
particularly supportive of the work we do. I believe 
that Flow Traders understands the importance of 
engaging with policy makers and explaining the 
principal trading business model to our 
stakeholders. They have also been strong 
advocates of our core principles: to foster stable, 
reliable and well-functioning markets, 
transparency, the requirement for a strong but 
appropriate regulatory framework, and equality of 
access.
Can you highlight some of the main developments 
that impacted your members in 2016? 
From the regulatory side the main topic has been 
MiFID II, of course. There were a number of 
important steps taken in 2016, including  
finalisation of most of the Level 2 regulatory 
standards. This means there is now greater clarity 
on what is expected from firms, particularly for 
principal trading firms such as Flow Traders. 
This means firms can now complete their MiFID II 
implementation work with greater assurance. 
Another key development was the decision by the 
European Union to delay the introduction of MiFID 
II by one year, meaning the date for application is 
now set for 3 January 2018. This was driven by the 
need for regulators and firms to develop systems 
capable of dealing with the huge amount of data 
they will receive from market participants when 
MiFID II is enacted. Brexit was also a key issue, as 
the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the 
European Union could impact the regulatory 
landscape significantly. We continue to follow 
developments closely.
What were the key issues trading firms brought to 
your attention during the year? 
One of the main issues currently concerning our 
members is the European capital requirements 
regime for investment firms. The existing regime 
essentially treats firms in our sector in the same 
way as they treat banks, which of course is not 
appropriate. This will have to change, which 
regulators are also recognising, fortunately. 
We are currently in close dialogue with the 
regulators to ensure that the new prudential 
regime being developed for investment firms 
takes into account the specific characteristics of 
principal trading firms. Their role as liquidity 
providers contributes greatly to the healthy 
functioning of markets, as traditional financial 
institutions are moving away from providing 
liquidity.
In what ways do you see new financial regulation, 
such as MiFID II, impacting market makers and the 
market as a whole?
We believe the impact of MiFID II on principal 
trading firms and the financial ecosystem is 
essential. Fortunately, the regulators have taken 
into account much of the feedback from the 
principal trading community, and we have been 
very active in providing input on our members’ 
business models so that the regulators could 
better understand what firms do and how they 
mitigate risk. The main positive from MiFID II is 
that it ensures a safe trading environment 
underpinned by extensive risk controls along the 
entire trading chain. Specifically, for the principal 
trading community MiFID II will also mean that all 
of our members will be regulated firms which are 
in full compliance with these rules. In that sense, 
MiFID II constitutes a renewed license to operate 
for our industry.
Aside from regulation, are there other developments 
relevant to the sector? 
One key development is the range of studies that 
were published in the past year refuting some of 
the undue criticism of our members’ trading 
practices. There is now a large body of evidence 
from regulatory bodies around the world, based 
on data-driven studies, which show that our 
members, as liquidity providers, offer clear 
benefits to the market. This provides an excellent 
basis for our industry to move on from the misrep-
resentations of the past and to start being 
recognised more widely for our positive contri-
bution in making markets work more efficiently 
and effectively for end-investors.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Flow Traders is designed to be risk-averse and 
risk-aware. We are intensely focused on risk 
management. We aim to keep our net exposure 
and market risk as small as possible by hedging 
exposure fully, and where possible, perfectly and 
instantaneously at all times. We monitor our 
activities on a real-time, fully automated basis 
using our robust risk management framework. 
As a result of this, in 2016 we had no days in which 
daily Net Trading Income was negative (loss days).
Organization
our trading professionals, who closely monitor our trading 
system, together with our Global heads of Trading, are our 
first line of defense. our Risk and Mid-office, compliance, 
finance and Internal audit departments serve as other 
internal multiple lines of defense. we maintain a strict 
segregation of duties, where Risk and Mid-office, 
compliance and finance are separate departments, each 
reporting individually to our Management board. In addition, 
trading venues and our prime brokers provide various risk 
controls, monitoring, and data we can use to reconcile our 
own records, while our regulators and other professional 
parties query us from time to time in respect of, among 
other things, our processes and risk controls.
we have a four-eyes approach, which means that every 
trading desk is staffed by at least two traders, at least one of 
whom is a senior trader, to monitor each other’s trading. 
our heads of Trading supervise our trading activities closely 
during the trading day.
we also use our remuneration model to promote risk 
awareness and responsible trading. Individual variable 
remuneration is dependent on the contribution to the 
success of flow Traders as a whole, thereby discouraging 
a culture of ‘star’ behavior. It fosters collaboration and 
teamwork, instead of focusing on individual trading 
profitability (in the case of traders). deferred variable 
remuneration acts as a first loss tranche to compensate for 
any operating loss in the subsequent years, before such loss 
would impact shareholder equity, serving as a powerful 
incentive for risk-awareness and prudent trading behavior. 
In addition, a number of employees were invited to invest in 
flow Traders in the past at fair value, using their own net 
worth, which, together with the lock-up attached to those 
shares, should align their interests with the long-term future 
of the company.
our trading strategies are designed to be non-directional, 
non-speculative and market-neutral. This means we aim to 
limit net exposure on the products we trade: we have no 
opinion on what the market does, and market movements 
do not affect the profit or loss on our positions. In addition, 
we maintain our policy of hedging our trades fully and, 
where possible, perfectly and instantaneously at all times. 
we hedge our positions in order to minimize net exposure 
and market risk. The vast majority of our trades are 
relatively small in size, further limiting trading risks.
Risk committee and reporting
The Management board determines our risk appetite and 
provides guidelines for overall risk management. The Risk 
and Mid-office department proposes policies to govern 
specific risk areas which need to be approved by the 
Management board. Risk management is carried out under 
policies approved by the Management board.
Members of our capital management team and our Trading 
and Risk and Mid-office departments work closely together 
to ensure that the risks we take are in line with the 
company’s strategy as determined by the Management

Governance code have been discussed by the supervisory 
board and all committees. for more information, please 
refer to the supervisory board Report.
Pursuant to our risk management policies, our automated 
management information systems generate reports in 
real-time on a daily basis. These reports include risk profiles, 
profit and loss analyzes and trading performance reports. 
some reports are processed immediately and others require 
intermediate checks by our Risk and Mid-office 
department. all of these reports are shared with our global 
Risk and Mid-office team and management to comply with 
our four-eyes principle. our assets and liabilities are 
marked-to-market daily by reference to official exchange 
prices, and they are re-valued continuously throughout the 
trading day for risk management and asset/liability 
management purposes.
Selected risks and how we address them
Managing market risk 
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from unfavorable 
market movements, such as prices, when positions in 
financial instruments are held. The value of a financial 
instrument may fluctuate because of changes in factors 
such as equity prices, currency rates, future dividend 
expectations, interest rates and volatilities. our hedging 
strategies, in combination with the use of straightforward 
products and continuous monitoring, aim to minimize this 
risk. The Risk and Mid-office department monitors market 
risk exposure on a continuous basis (including intraday). 
based on the limits set per product or the aggregated risk, 
limit breaches, if any, will trigger action from the Risk team 
in order to reduce the risk. In addition, the trading positions 
committee of the supervisory board include supervision 
and monitoring, as well as advising the Management board 
on the operation of our internal risk management and 
control systems. The Trading and Risk committee is also 
responsible for providing advice to the Management board 
on the company’s development, performance and 
sustainability of its trading strategies. It maintains regular 
contact with the company’s Trading and Risk and Mid-office 
departments and reports periodically to the supervisory 
board. for more information on the responsibilities of our 
Trading and Risk committee, please see the chapter our 
Governance.
following a review of the company’s risk assessment 
processes, the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems has been identified as 
a priority and as a joint responsibility of the supervisory 
board and all committees. The members of the supervisory 
board have agreed that the supervisory board and each 
committee monitors risks identified as relevant to their 
specific expertise. This means that the relevant items set 
out in best practice provision II.1.4 of the dutch corporate 
board (e.g. in terms of the products traded, positions, 
markets and their characteristics, the factors of which are 
continuously assessed given market circumstances and our 
trading portfolio at that time). The Risk and Mid-office 
department independently assesses, monitors, quantifies 
and documents possible risks, which are inherent to trading 
in an automated environment. our risk management 
framework is robust and transparent, capturing all risks 
which are relevant to our business. we continuously reassess 
the limits set and methodologies used in our risk 
management framework.
Risk information is reported to the Global head of Risk and 
Mid-office, heads of Trading and Management board on 
a daily basis. a process of escalation is in place in the event 
a material issue arises and any relevant steps and decisions 
are well-documented. The Risk and Mid-office department 
also defines and assesses possible scenarios, and plans 
accompanying mitigating actions. In every office there are 
dedicated risk departments present that have (at least) 
weekly calls with all risk team members. our risk team 
members regularly rotate roles to disseminate knowledge, 
serve as a fresh pair of eyes, and be able to manage risk in all 
offices from every location in a consistent manner.
we have a standing risk committee that continuously 
assesses the risks we face in our business, comprised of our 
Global head of Risk and Mid-office and Global head of 
Trading. aside from ongoing ad-hoc communication, there is 
a recurring meeting in which they discuss all relevant 
position limits, strategies, procedures, capital requirements 
and other requirements of prime brokers and market 
developments. any major changes to our risk systems, 
strategies and limit setting must subsequently be approved 
by the Management board. In addition, the Trading and Risk 
‘Our risk 
management 
framework is 
robust and 
transparent.’

Can you give us a short company description?
iShares is the brand name of Blackrock’s range of 
Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). iShares is the 
market leader in ETPs and we provide exposure 
across a wide range of asset classes and markets. 
The firm offers over 500 ETPs globally1, from 
broad based equity and bond funds through to 
more specialist areas such as alternative assets 
and emerging markets.
Can you describe your role within iShares and your 
connection to Flow Traders?
Within iShares I head up the Capital Markets 
function in EMEA. The team focusses on managing 
relationships with liquidity providers and 
distributors of our funds. We provide market 
insights to our investors and we aim to improve the 
ETP ecosystem more broadly by working with 
stock exchanges, trading platforms and regulators 
to better the liquidity of our product. Flow Traders 
are a major provider of liquidity in our fund range. 
They make markets on exchanges in our ETP range 
and they are also what we call an Authorised 
Participant, which means they are able to create 
and redeem shares in our products in order to 
balance the supply and demand.
1 Source: Blackrock as at 30th November 2016
One of the big drivers for change in the industry will 
be MiFID II. How will it impact the ETP landscape?
We think MiFID II will deliver a number of 
enhancements to the ETP ecosystem. ETPs were 
not in scope of MiFID I, meaning trades were not 
required to be printed to the tape, and even over 
the counter (OTC) trades were not required to be 
reported. MiFID II reverses this situation. This will 
lead to greater transparency of ETP liquidity, 
which in our view will drive greater adoption of the 
product. And through greater transparency and an 
emphasis on best execution, MiFID II is expected 
to drive more liquidity on exchange. As a provider 
of ETPs, we believe that the majority of ETP 
liquidity should be delivered through 
a transparent venue such as a stock exchange, 
whilst acknowledging the benefits of trading in 
OTC markets for larger trade sizes. We believe that 
Flow Traders are well positioned through their 
advanced technology platform to provide this 
increased liquidity demand both on and off 
exchanges.
What other trends and developments (apart from 
MiFID II) do you see influencing the sector in the 
coming years? 
For portfolio managers seeking to replicate the 
performance of major equity indexes, futures 
have historically been the instrument of choice. 
This preference was primarily the result of higher 
liquidity and the lower holding cost of futures. 
However, in recent years the equity derivative 
markets have witnessed a structural dislocation, 
wherein the financing costs for futures have 
spiked to multi-year highs. ETPs, on the other 
hand, have become far more efficient and cheaper 
to access. Increased Assets under Management 
have led to better liquidity and lower trading costs 
due to the support of liquidity providers such as 
Flow Traders. In contrast to the headwinds faced 
by futures, due in part to regulatory changes to 
capital rules, ETPs have progressively become 
more efficient and cheaper to access, thus 
becoming a more cost-efficient alternative for 
investors looking for beta-replicating exposures.
How do you expect the role of liquidity providers 
such as Flow Traders to develop over the coming 
years?
We are seeing the number and type of investors in 
ETPs increasing, which include entities as diverse 
as retail investors through to sophisticated bond 
investors who have never traded an equity-like 
instrument. These investor types are going to 
access liquidity in different ways and the number 
of new trading venues is likely to increase. 
With that, new trading technology will emerge. 
In order to provide effective pricing to investors, 
liquidity providers will have to continuously 
innovate and build on their platforms. The role of 
specialist and technologically able firms will 
become critical in delivering liquidity to end 
investors. Regulatory pressure on bank balance 
sheets means that different market participants 
will likely step into the space vacated by banking 
entities.
Could you elaborate on how liquidity providers such 
as Flow Traders contribute to the success of the ETP 
industry?
A healthy ETP ecosystem relies on liquidity 
providers that can accurately price and trade the 
securities held within an ETP. In addition, they will 
create or redeem ETP shares based on the demand 
for the product and also provide an external 
distribution arm that sells products to the 
investor. The liquidity provider is therefore crucial 
to the commercial success of the product and they 
maintain a stable market that aids price discovery 
and valuation of the ETP.

are also monitored daily, and the applicable haircuts and 
margins are computed by our prime brokers.
Managing a drop in trading volumes
our net Trading Income and profi tability are primarily 
a function of the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, 
in the fi nancial instruments in which we trade, and the 
bid-ask spreads (which largely determine the profi t on the 
trade, or margins, we capture) resulting from the difference 
between the prices which buyers are willing to pay for the 
fi nancial instruments we sell and the prices which sellers are 
willing to accept for the fi nancial instruments we buy. 
Trading volumes in securities, derivatives and other fi nancial 
instruments on exchanges and in other trading venues 
worldwide are directly affected by factors beyond our 
control, including economic and political conditions, broad 
trends in business and fi nance, regulatory requirements, 
actions by central banks, and changes in the markets in 
which such transactions occur.
we have developed strategies to cope with periods of little 
market movement. from our experience we know that in 
these periods some trading desks tend to earn less where 
others show an increase in earnings. Therefore, these 
strategies may serve as a (partial) hedge in such 
circumstances. To control the risk of low market activity, 
we actively manage our costs and aim to keep our fi xed 
costs low.
Managing counterparty risk
with regard to dealing with third parties, such as issuers, 
trading venues, prime brokers or approved counterparties 
for off-exchange trading, we have strict on-boarding 
procedures, risk management approval and ongoing 
monitoring in place. before entering into a new business 
relationship with a counterparty, we review their fi nancial 
standing, reputation and recent developments. Transactions 
with such third parties are validated and reconciled by 
separate departments.
To address the credit risk we face, we clear almost all of our 
on-exchange trades through our prime brokers and central 
counterparties (ccPs). Trades that are not offered for central 
clearing (e.g. in off-exchange trading) are typically settled 
by way of delivery-versus-payment, which means that the 
delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment 
by the buyer. This limits counterparty risk. In order to further 
mitigate counterparty risk, we make sure that the 
settlement cycle of trades is kept short, aiming to ensure 
that the counterparty risk is only borne during the limited 
time of the settlement cycle. If a settlement cycle of more 
than three days is required, the trade can only be executed 
with prior approval from the Risk and Mid-offi ce 
department.
Managing liquidity risk
our liquidity risk, the risk that there is not suffi cient trading 
capital or regulatory capital, is managed by intra-day 
monitoring of credit lines from our prime brokers, cash, 
portfolio effi ciency and liquidity. furthermore, in our trading 
we focus on trading liquid exchange-listed instruments 
which helps us unwind positions more easily than in the case 
of illiquid or unlisted instruments. In addition, flow Traders is 
an authorized participant for over 25 eTP issuers refl ecting

more than 80% of the worldwide issuer eTP assets under 
Management. This position allows us to create and redeem 
eTPs with their issuers. our settlement risk is mitigated by 
a multi-layered monitoring process of settlements.
Managing operational and IT risk 
operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or 
external events. operational risk management is an integral 
part of flow Traders’ management information and control 
systems. as our operational risks are concentrated in 
technology events at exchanges and clearing houses, our 
investment in technology is important to mitigate those 
associated risks.
we operate an integrated, in-house developed, 
high-performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new hardware 
and software. our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement improvements in 
both hardware and software on an ongoing basis. controlled 
releases of hardware and software enhancements provide 
for minimal disruption to our business.
The environment in which our trading software (or updates 
of our trading software) is being developed is strictly 
separated from the environment in which such trading 
software operates in production. access to the source code 
is strictly controlled and limited. Prior to releasing our 
trading software, or an update into the production 
environment, relevant elements of our trading software are 
subjected to a review of its code, validation in an 
environment that is separate from our production 
environment, validating in limited production (processing 
a strictly limited number of orders) on one trading desk in 
respect of trading a single financial instrument, followed by 
more extensive testing across multiple desks and/or trading 
multiple financial instruments. each step, and progression 
through the steps, is documented.
flow Traders has a monitoring system in place to control 
undisrupted trading activities in real time. Multilayer 
monitoring is employed to avoid errors, but, when these 
occur the relevant teams are notified via multiple 
notification channels. we rely on multiple third party service 
providers for business and market data. 
our systems are designed such that they can be monitored 
in real-time, as well as being maintained and supported by 
qualified professionals from any office. our risk 
management system is fully integrated with our trading 
platform, analyzing real-time pricing data, and is designed 
to ensure that our order activity is conducted within strict 
pre-determined trading and position limits. for example, 
our pre-trade risk controls are designed to prevent the 
trading engines from sending orders which deviate from our 
pre-defined risk parameters, such as price and volume limits 
set by the Risk and Mid-office department, which keeps our 
ordering, trading and positions well within tolerance levels. 
our monitoring tools reconcile trades, prices and positions 
against those of the exchanges and prime brokers. our IT 
systems are regularly subjected to penetration tests by 
external experts. we have a comprehensive IT security 
system that is designed to protect us from attacks both 
from inside and outside the platform.
where we have a technical interface with institutions like our 
prime brokers and exchanges, the integrity of the 
connection between the systems and the data that is being 
exchanged is subject to prior conformance testing and 
continuous monitoring. Unexpected deviations are flagged 
and investigated. we also have a disaster recovery plan in 
place, which, for instance, provides that our amsterdam 
office acts as a backup site for other offices.
Managing our regulatory risk
while we have no clients and do not provide investment 
services or ancillary services to third parties, our markets 
and nearly all aspects of our business are heavily regulated. 
where applicable, entities forming part of our Group have 
obtained the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses. 
flow Traders’ trading operations are established in four 
international jurisdictions. as a Group we currently trade on 
more than 100 venues worldwide. In addition, we operate on 
various other venues through brokers. as we have to comply 
with our home regulations and the local regulations and 
trading rules of all venues on which we trade, our regulatory 
landscape is vast. legislators and regulators worldwide 
strengthen their supervision within our environment, 
demanding a professional and well-structured compliance 
organization.
our compliance department assists management and 
operations at Group and local level by identifying, advising 
on, reviewing and reporting on regulations. It also seeks to 
maintain a compliant business environment through training 
and monitoring in order to ensure and enhance the group’s 
conformance with its regulatory obligations. 
The compliance and Risk and Mid-office departments have 
promulgated and implemented pre-trade risk controls, 
internal rules and regulations that were developed following 
regulatory requirements, guidelines from market authorities, 
industry best practices and our own best practices.

systems provide a reasonable assurance that the financial 
reporting does not contain any errors of material 
importance and that the risk management and control 
systems worked properly in 2016. however, these systems 
cannot provide absolute certainty that no errors have 
occurred or that our targets will be achieved, or that 
a misstatement of flow Traders’ financial statements 
can be prevented.
Statement by the Management Board

according to the best of our knowledge: 
 
◾
the financial statements present a true and fair view of 
the assets, the liabilities, the financial position and the 
result of flow Traders n.V. and the companies included 
in the consolidation; and

Principal Traders association (fIa ePTa), a member of the 
fIa Principal Traders Group (fIa PTG) in the Us and 
a member of fIa asia. These are industry groups that consist 
of leading principal trading firms. we are also a member of 
the dutch association of Proprietary Traders (aPT), 
operating as an industry body of netherlands-based 
liquidity providers. as part of these important groups, we 
continue to promote, foremost, the principle that all 
markets and market participants should be adequately and 
transparently regulated. within these groups we contribute 
to discussions regarding current and new regulations, 
including cRd IV/cRR, MifId II, Reg aT and market 
regulations. we will continue to contribute to these 
discussions and will persist in maximizing transparency 
in respect of our industry, its benefits for all market 
participants and fair, orderly and transparent 
financial markets.
In control statement
The Management board is responsible for designing and 
maintaining an adequate system for internal control over 
financial reporting. In order to facilitate this, the Risk and 
Mid-office department assessed the controls in this process 
and reported its findings to the Management board. These 
findings have been evaluated by the Management board 
and by the supervisory board. for a more elaborate 
explanation of our efforts in this regard, we refer to the 
chapter above on our Risk Management.
In accordance with best practice provision II.1.5 of the dutch 
corporate Governance code, and with due observance of 
the limitations stated below, we confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge the internal risk management and control 
laws and regulations, including tax laws, are subject to 
change or can be interpreted differently in practice over 
time. while we believe we are well-positioned to address 
and implement new or changing regulations in general, and 
while we spend considerable resources to anticipate and 
implement new or changing regulations, we typically cannot 
(fully) assess what the impact of such regulations will 
eventually be in practice. new regulations or revised 
interpretations of regulations may or may not be beneficial 
to our business.
actual or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements could adversely affect our 
reputation, profitability and prospects. This may also be the 
case for differences in interpretation or lack of timely or 
complete implementation of regulatory requirements. 
sanctions could include fines, penalties, disgorgements and 
censures, suspension or expulsion from trading venues or 
the revocation or limitation of licenses. we aim to minimize 
such risks by focusing considerable management attention, 
employing highly-qualified compliance and risk 
professionals, deploying training, monitoring and reporting 
systems, and continuously evaluating and implementing 
current and upcoming regulation on our operations. 
notwithstanding such efforts, given the highly regulated 
nature of our business, we are regularly subject of routine 
(and sometimes more targeted) inquiries and audits from 
regulators and trading venues. It is difficult to predict or 
manage the outcome of such inquiries, although we aim to 
be as transparent and cooperative as possible given the 
circumstances. 
we continuously invest in good professional relationships 
with trading venues, regulators and other relevant parties.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Message of the Chairman
2016 was the first year that the supervisory board went 
through the entire cycle of its responsibilities, including 
working on the budget, strategy, and annual figures, as well 
as the General Meeting and its various committees. It was 
also the first year we carried out a self-assessment. 
In general, the conclusion is positive. each supervisory board 
meeting was notable for its in-depth, passionate, and 
productive discussions about a wide range of topics, 
a number of which included presentations from senior 
management who updated us on developments in the 
financial markets.
Company developments
despite challenging market conditions, characterized by 
lower volatility and decreased market activity, the company 
was able to increase its market share. It also grew the 
number of products it trades in and opened an Institutional 
Trading operation in the Us and asia, strengthening its 
position and paving the way for further increase of volume 
traded. at the same time, flow Traders invested in new 
systems, infrastructure and people, helping to create a more 
robust and future-proof company. building a stronger 
franchise in periods of decreased market activity will pay off 
when volumes increase.
A year in review
during the year the supervisory board discussed a range of 
topics at its regular meetings and within its four committees: 
Remuneration and appointments; audit; Trading and Risk; 
and Technology. 
one key topic was the company’s senior management 
structure in relation to its growth ambitions. The supervisory 
board discussed the benefits of expanding the company’s 
Management board, which was extended to three members 
following the appointment of Marcel Jongmans as cfo 
in october. as well as taking responsibility for the company’s 
finances, Marcel will also be responsible for investor 
relations, Mid-office and the relationships with our 
prime brokers.
during the year the supervisory board agreed the company 
would initiate an internal audit function, providing the 
company with three lines of defense. This is now in place and 
the supervisory board was satisfied with the process to 
establish it. The supervisory board also finalized the new 
remuneration policy, which was agreed at the annual 
General Meeting (aGM) in May. discussions were held in the 
Remuneration and the appointment committee on what is 
the best policy to support the company’s growth ambitions 
and its culture. Topics that were considered include risk, the 
requirements of the company’s employees, and the general 
market.
In May, at the company’s first annual General Meeting, the 
co-ceos and the supervisory board had the opportunity to 
discuss with shareholders the progress we are making as 
a company. Transparency and the need to successfully 
outline our business model were key features of the 
meeting, which also provided an ideal opportunity to explain 
the company’s vision and outlook. 
A unique culture
The supervisory board had a number of discussions 
throughout the year on flow Traders’ internal culture. 
The supervisory board recognizes that the company has 
a very special culture, characterized by its hard working, 
innovative, and highly-talented people who share the 
ambition to be part of a company grows and develops. 
The supervisory board believes that it is very important the 
company preserves this culture, and aims to ensure future 
growth ambitions, which will require new hires, do not cause 
the culture to become diluted.
Looking ahead
during its self-assessment, the supervisory board 
recognized that there is some overlap between the 
committees. To address this, it intends to increase efficiency 
and restructure the committees in 2017. additional focus 
areas will be on the company’s strategy and future plans, 
while the upcoming MifId II regulations and developments 
in remuneration will also be key topics.
Regards, 
eric drok
chairman of the supervisory board

At the beginning of 2017, eight employees from Flow 
Traders fl ew out to Tanzania for the adventure of 
a life time. Their goal? To climb Africa’s highest peak, 
Mount Kilimanjaro. In addition to the individual 
challenge, the team had another objective: to raise 
as much money as it could for War Child, 
a non-governmental organization that provides 
assistance to children in areas experiencing confl ict 
and the aftermath of confl ict. In total, the team 
raised over € 40,000 for the charity. Two of the 
team’s participants, Thijmen Klok and Rein Moes, 
talk about why they got involved and what the 
climb meant to them.
How did you come to choose Mt. Kilimanjaro and 
how did the eight of you get together? 
Thijmen: ‘In the run up to Christmas 2015 the 
company gave everyone the opportunity to give 
money to a charity of their choice. Quite a few 
chose War Child, and through this one of our 
colleagues heard about the War Child Kilimanjaro 
charity trek. I went to the information evening and 
became enthusiastic about the idea. I then sent 
out emails to see if anyone else in the company 
was interested, and we ended up with eight very 
keen participants.’ 
Rein: ‘The fi rst time I saw the email from Thijmen 
I was very intrigued, and once I investigated a bit 
more I knew it was a win-win situation: an 
incredible adventure together with colleagues, 
combined with the chance to raise money for 
a great cause.’ 
Can you tell us how the trip was organized?
Thijmen: ‘Most of the organization is done by War 
Child, but we had to prepare well and make sure 
we were physically capable of carrying out the 
climb. As part of our training we spent a weekend 
camping and hiking in the Ardennes, in southeast 
Belgium. We also organized an information day on 
altitude sickness, which helped us prepare for the 
physical challenges. It was our responsibility to 
organize the kit, which in most cases meant 
borrowing or buying, as well as paying for our own 
ﬂ ights, accommodation and fees. We decided to 
have the same jackets, which the company 
co-sponsored. And they also very generously 
provided a large part of the € 20,000 sponsorship 
we needed to raise.’
Rein: ‘Besides from going the actual distance and 
height of the track, there are two other 
considerable challenges when going up Mount 
Kilimanjaro. One is how to cope with the 
5 different climate zones you go through during 
the climb, ranging from a rain forest zone on the 
bottom of the mountain to a glacial zone at the 
top. War Child arranged collaboration with a local 
outdoor sports gear retailer, who was very 
forthcoming with advising us on the clothing and 
gear we needed to a make it through these 
different climate zones. Furthermore, they were 
kind enough to provide us with a discount, their 
way of contributing to the good cause. The second 
challenge is the lack of oxygen in the air higher on 
the mountain. Altitude sickness is one of the main 
reasons why people fail to make it to the top. 
Therefor we got in contact with a physiotherapist 
specialized in performing on high altitude and 
altitude sickness training. We learned about what 
high altitude does to your body and mind and he 
gave us insight in our personal susceptibility to 
altitude sickness. Thereafter, to best prepare our 
bodies for performing with a lack of oxygen, we 
rented a machine simulating these circumstances. 
This proved to be very helpful for adapting to the 
circumstances higher on the mountain.’
 
What do you hope to get out of the adventure 
personally?
Thijmen: ‘I wanted to see if I could do it. And it’s 
a motivation for the future. You realize that if you 
put your mind to it, you can really achieve what 
you want. It was also a great opportunity to 
become healthier.’ 
Rein: ‘Beyond the fi tness, I found that the trip 
provided me with a very good insight into my 
physical capabilities and mental resilience. 
Looking back, this will give us all greater strength 
and tolerance. And, of course, it has brought us 
closer to each other as a group. We had to really 
work together as a team, motivating one another 
to stay strong but we all made it to the the top.’

board should preferably have a broad and in-depth 
knowledge of its business activities and the fast paced 
environment in which it operates. Jan van Kuijk, Roger 
hodenius and han sikkens, as former board members and 
shareholder representatives, were attracted for their role as 
supervisory board members because of their specific 
business-related expertise. all supervisory board members, 
except for one member, should be independent within the 
meaning of the dutch corporate Governance code. Jan van 
Kuijk, Roger hodenius and han sikkens do not qualify as 
independent under the provisions of the dutch corporate 
Governance code as they are all former members of the 
Management board of the company prior to conversion and 
represent shareholders of the company. for further 
information, reference is made to the section on Major 
shareholders in the chapter on our Governance.
Committees
The supervisory board has four committees: an audit 
committee, a Remuneration and appointment committee, 
a Trading and Risk committee, and a Technology committee. 
each committee has a preparatory and/or advisory role to 
the supervisory board. The composition of the committees 
is as follows:
Evaluation of the Supervisory Board
The supervisory board reviewed its own performance 
through self-assessment and its own functioning using 
a survey. In preparation of the self-assessment, a number of 
people from within the business, including the Management 
board, and the Global heads of the Trading, Technology, Risk 
and Mid-office, and legal and compliance departments, 
were interviewed to assess the supervisory board’s 
performance. Items that were assessed and discussed 
included the composition of the supervisory board, specific 
knowledge about the business of flow Traders, attendance 
of the meetings, the functioning of the company secretary, 
the committees, education, and professional development. 
Profile of the Supervisory Board
The supervisory board profile provides that the 
qualifications of a particular candidate and fit with the 
company’s needs shall always prevail when filling a position. 
when selecting members, the supervisory board aims for 
a balance in nationality, gender, age, experience, and active 
or retired backgrounds. In addition, there will be a balance in 
the experience and affinity with the nature and culture of 
the business of the company. The supervisory board strives 
to realize a diverse composition in the nomination and 
appointment process for vacancies of its members, while 
taking into account the overall profile and selection criteria 
for appointments of suitable candidates to the supervisory 
board. as such, diversity, including gender-related, is an 
important consideration in the selection process for (re-)
appointment of supervisory board members.
Independence of the Supervisory Board
our supervisory board profile provides that, given the highly 
specialized and competitive nature of the company’s 
business activities, certain members of the supervisory 
olivier bisserier, as chairman of the audit committee, is 
a financial expert as set out by the dutch corporate 
Governance code. both the chairman of the audit 
committee and the chairman of the Remuneration and 
appointment committee qualify as independent under the 
provisions of the dutch corporate Governance code. 
The Trading and Risk committee and Technology committee 
have been established to cater for the monitoring of and 
advising on specific business related topics and reflect our 
business model of Pricing, cutting-edge Technology 
Platform and Risk Management focus. These committees 
are chaired by the founders and former Management board 
members of the company. for more information on the 
responsibilities of our committees, please refer to the 
chapter our Governance. 
The committees report to the supervisory board by sharing 
their advice and recommendations during the supervisory 
board meetings and by circulating the minutes of the 
meetings or reports. all meetings were held at the 
company’s offices in amsterdam.

Audit Committee 
the audit Committee met five times in 2016, with each 
meeting fully attended. other attendees included one of 
the Co-Ceos, CFo, the Global Heads of Finance and tax and 
the external auditor, who had a standing invitation to each 
meeting.
during these meetings the Committee discussed the annual 
results, the half yearly results and the quarterly results. 
other topics discussed included the Management Board’s 
assessment of the company’s internal risk and control 
systems, new and proposed legislative initiatives related to 
accounting, auditing and financial reporting, tax planning, 
the company’s compliance with rules and regulations, the 
company’s Code of Conduct and Whistle-blower policy, and 
the company’s financing strategy (including the interim 
dividend proposal). the company’s external auditor, ernst & 
young accountants LLp (ey), attended all meetings. topics 
discussed with the external auditor included their 
unqualified interim review report, their audit plan, and the 
transition planning for the financial year 2016. the audit 
Committee reviewed the management letter issued by the 
former external auditor KpMG accountants N.v. (KpMG) and 
discussed the actions taken by management to address 
KpMG’s recommendations and observations.
External auditor
the audit Committee and the Management Board reported 
to the Supervisory Board on ey’s functioning as the external 
auditor, on its fees, as well as on other audit and non-audit 
services it provided to the company. ey performed a review 
of the company’s interim financial statements and issued an 
unqualified review report. the audit Committee evaluated 
the qualifications, performance and independence of ey, 
taking into account the opinions of the Management Board. 
the audit Committee also obtained a report from the 
external auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. ey confirmed its independence 
from Flow traders in accordance with the professional 
standards applicable to it. ey’s lead audit partner was 
present at all of the audit Committee meetings held in 2016. 
KpMG was present at the first two meetings of the audit 
Committee, related to 2015 results in its role as prior years 
auditor.
Review internal audit function 
the company is intensely focused on risk management and 
monitors its activities on a real-time, fully automated basis 
using its robust risk management framework. Flow traders’ 
trading professionals, who closely monitor the trading 
system, are the company’s first line of defense. the risk and 
Mid-office, Compliance and Finance departments serve as 
other internal lines of defense. in addition, exchanges and 
prime brokers provide various risk controls, monitoring, and 
data that the company can use to reconcile its own records, 
while the regulators and other professional parties query 
the company from time to time in respect of, among others, 
processes and risk controls. the Management Board came 
to the conclusion that the company requires an internal 
audit function, which subsequently was approved by the 
audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. the internal 
audit function was installed during 2016. For more 
information, please refer to the section on the internal audit 
function in the chapter our Governance.
Remuneration and Appointment Committee
the remuneration and appointment Committee met five 
times in 2016. except for one meeting in which one of the 
committee members was absent, all meetings were fully 
attended. other attendees included the Management 
Board, the Global Head of HrM and recruitment and the 
Global Head of Legal and Compliance. during the meetings 
the remuneration and appointment Committee established 
its ways of working together, reviewed the company’s 
General remuneration policy and drafted proposals to the 
Supervisory Board for the remuneration practices to be 
pursued for the Management Board and staff of the 
company. it also drafted proposals for the remuneration of 
the individual members of the Management Board for 
adoption by the Supervisory Board. Further, the 
appointment of a new member of the Management Board 
(CFo) was prepared for adoption by the Supervisory Board, 
and for the further submission to the General Meeting for 
adoption. the size, composition and functioning of the 
Supervisory Board and Management Board was reviewed 
and findings reported to the Supervisory Board. other duties 
included the monitoring of developments of the dutch 
Corporate Governance Code and regulations in relation to 
remuneration policies and the preparation of the 
remuneration report.
Trading and Risk Committee
the trading and risk Committee met four times in 2016, with 
each meeting fully attended. the main focus in the 
meetings was the Management Board’s risk assessment. 
the Management Board (in part or in full), the Global Heads 
of trading and the Global Head of risk and Mid-office 
attended all meetings. the attendees discussed in detail the 
relevant risks the company is exposed to, the internal 
controls in place to address these risks, and the 
Management Board’s views on such risks. the trading and 
risk Committee was also briefed by the Global Head of 
trading on developments in the trading department, 
including growth areas and budget matters. additionally, the 
trading and risk Committee set about structuring itself in

discharge the Management Board for their 
management and the Supervisory Board for its 
supervision of the company in the financial year 
under review.
Remuneration report 
the remuneration of the Management Board consists of 
a relatively modest fixed base salary and a variable 
compensation in cash. the awarding of variable 
remuneration to the members of the Management Board – 
as well as to all employees – is entirely dependent on the 
company’s profit in any given year. in that sense, our 
remuneration policy works as a risk mitigating tool and 
a self-correcting mechanism. if there is no profit, no variable 
remuneration will be awarded. if there is profit, the variable 
remuneration awarded to all employees and the 
Management Board is capped at 40% of the company’s 
operating profits result over the performance year minus 
applicable adjustments (e.g. taxes, capital charges and 
extraordinary items). Historically, this has amounted to 
approximately 36% of our operating result. if the company 
incurs a loss, deferred variable remuneration is reduced or 
forfeited entirely. in accordance with the global 
remuneration model in place for all employees, the 
members of the Management Board are entitled to annual 
variable compensation based on performance in respect of 
individual criteria and the contribution to the success of the 
company as whole. these criteria reflect quantitative and 
qualitative criteria related to non-financial performance. 
variable remuneration, if awarded, is paid in cash in 
instalments and may be reduced or clawed back under 
circumstances described in the remuneration act, dutch 
corporate law and the dutch Corporate Governance Code.

Technology Committee
the technology Committee met three times in 2016, with 
each meeting fully attended. invitees of the meeting were 
one of the Co-Ceos, and the relevant Global Heads. 
the technology Committee discussed the company’s it 
budget for 2017, it-related investments and expenses, the 
main technology-related risks facing the company and the 
focus on recruiting new talent. recurring items were the 
state of the company’s hardware, software, innovation, 
cyber-security, and Hr-related topics. Hiring new 
technology talent remains a challenge, with many 
companies competing for the same people. to help address 
this challenge, the company expanded its in-house 
recruitment team. this paid off, with the technology 
department growing significantly in 2016.
Financial statements and dividend
the 2016 financial statements were prepared by the 
Management Board. they were discussed both with the 
audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, in attendance 
of ey. the financial statements were audited by ey, who 
issued an unqualified auditor’s report. reference is made to 
the auditor’s report on page 103 of the financial statements. 
the Supervisory Board approved the financial statements as 
audited by ey, including the company’s dividend proposal. 
We invite the General Meeting to:

adopt the financial statements for 2016;

adopt the dividend proposal as proposed by the 
Management Board and approved by the

MiFID II introduces new rules that will apply to 
market makers that use algorithmic trading, 
including high frequency trading strategies. Can you 
explain how this will impact Compliance within the 
company?
The underlying principles of MiFID II are not 
completely new. They should be the standard for 
everyone who applies algorithmic trading 
techniques. MiFID and, for example, ESMA 
guidelines apply to all fi rms operating in our 
industry, and prescribe standards on transparency, 
controls, governance and so on. To a large extent, 
adhering to these guidelines would already give 
you good coverage on the basics of MiFID II. So the 
consensus is already there, and we now have to 
connect all the dots to have the tools to be 100 
percent compliant by the 2018 introduction date. 
Can you list and elaborate on the top-5 MiFID II 
topics that will impact Flow Traders?
The main issues that affect us will be record 
keeping, pre-and post-trade transparency, trade 
publication, trade reporting, and change 
management. One of the operational outcomes of 
this is that all of the exchanges we trade on will 
have to implement MiFID II on their systems, which 
means there will also be an operational burden on 
the exchanges and their clients to implement this 
in time. The biggest challenge with MiFID II at the 
moment is that there is still a great deal of 
uncertainty, with many topics open to 
interpretation. To help resolve this we participate 
in MiFID II discussions with other market 
participants and FIA EPTA, the European Principal 
Traders Association and APT, the Association of 
Proprietary Traders. Whoever is interested in 
getting clarifi cation can discuss their issues in the 
group and FIA EPTA and APT can take the 
questions to the regulator.
What steps have Compliance taken to prepare for 
the introduction of MiFID II? 
We’ve been involved with discussions and 
consultations from the very beginning, which has 
enabled us to explain the impact potential 
regulations would have on our business and the 
business of our market peers. In this way we’ve 
been able to share knowledge with the regulators 
and help them better understand what it is we do, 
which leads to more effective legislation. As the 
legislation takes shape, it’s our job to analyse the 
impact it will have on the business. We then see 
where we have coverage and where we have gaps, 
before translating the new rules into usable 
information that can be implemented across the 
business.
How comfortable are you with the introduction of 
MiFID II?
I think that I feel fairly comfortable with the 
process so far. There are still some operational 
aspects that need to be fi nalised in the coming 
months, but it’s a work in progress. Across the 
business, focus groups working with other fi rms 
will ensure we move forward in tandem, which 
means there’ll be no nasty surprises the closer we 
get to the deadline. So market participants, from 
banks, brokers, liquidity providers such as Flow 
Traders, and exchanges right through to the 
national regulators are all involved. The entire 
market structure of Europe is being redefi ned. 
So if you take into account the uncertainty that is 
still there we have to look at how much time and 
effort is being put in by the industry to become 
MiFID II compliant. I think it’s fair to ask whether or 
not MiFID II is perhaps overshooting its original 
ambition, although we believe greater 
transparency will help the markets, which of 
course is a good thing.

Remuneration
We want to attract and retain the best talent 
available. We believe that awarding an attractive 
and competitive remuneration package is an 
important part of our proposition to candidates 
and employees. Therefore, we offer our 
employees a combination of fixed and variable 
pay. We share a single firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool and people are awarded a 
share of that pool based on their performance. 
No variable remuneration is awarded if there is no 
or insufficient profit or capital.  
Introduction
we not only create transparency in the financial markets,  
we also firmly believe in being transparent. our global 
remuneration model provides for a detailed and transparent 
awarding procedure with appropriate checks and balances 
and publication requirements. The company has discussed 
the company’s remuneration model with regulators, 
legislators, major shareholder representatives and 
shareholder representative bodies.
Key principles and policy
our global remuneration model reflects our key principles 
by practically implementing our general remuneration policy 
as approved by the General Meeting and published on our 
website (the General Remuneration Policy), the dutch act on 
Remuneration Policy of financial Undertakings (wet 
beloningsbeleid financiële ondernemingen, the 
Remuneration act), and related laws and regulations in 
a manner that is tailored to the size of our enterprise and the 
way it is organized, as well as the nature, scope and 
complexity of our business activities.
our global remuneration model implements the General 
Remuneration Policy approved by the General Meeting on 
19 May 2016, the Remuneration act and related laws and 
regulations in practice, in a manner that is tailored to the size 
of our company and the way it is organized. It takes into 
account the nature, scope and complexity of our business 
activities and is consistent with, and promotes, sound and 
effective risk management. It encourages alignment of the 
risks taken by employees and of the company itself, and 
does not encourage risk taking which is inconsistent with our 
risk profile. It is in line with our business strategy, objectives, 
values and interests and includes measures to avoid 
conflicts of interest. finally, it must not lead to the risk that 
third parties are treated improperly (although we do not 
provide any investment service or ancillary service to third 
parties). 
Our global remuneration model
we are committed to attracting and retaining the best talent 
available. our staff, including the members of the 
Management board, receive competitive remuneration 
packages. This includes a fixed gross salary and an award 
from the singular firm-wide variable remuneration pool. 
The remuneration pool is accrued throughout the year at 
40% of flow Traders’ operating result over the performance 
year minus applicable adjustments (e.g. taxes, capital 
charges and extraordinary items), reflecting company 
performance. historically this amounts to approximately 
36% of our operating result. The variable component of the 
total remuneration is dynamic, as it is a function of operating 
result: if there is no or insufficient profit or capital, there will 
be no variable remuneration. for example, if in any given 
year no profit is made, none of our employees will receive 
any variable remuneration. If the company incurs a loss, 
deferred variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited 
entirely. This policy also applies to members of the 
Management board.

we apply an annual performance cycle. at the beginning of 
each calendar year clear objectives are set depending on an 
employee’s role, which are in line with our objectives for the 
year and corporate key competencies: drive, ownership and 
teamwork. Performance is reviewed during mid-year and 
year-end staff appraisals. 
Individual variable remuneration payable from the collective 
bonus pool is dependent on company and business unit 
performance, individual performance and the individual’s 
contribution to the long-term success of the company as 
a whole, discouraging a culture of ‘star’ behavior and 
fostering collaboration and teamwork. flow Traders does 
not base variable remuneration on fi nancial results achieved 
individually. The supervisory board approves the awarding of 
variable remuneration.
If awarded, for most recipients variable remuneration is paid 
in cash in two or three annual instalments. The deferred 
variable component acts as a fi rst loss tranche to 
compensate any operating loss in the subsequent year, 
acting as a buffer before such loss would impact 
shareholder equity. This serves as an important incentive for 
risk-aware behavior, keeping in mind the long-term 
objectives of the company and alignment with our risk 
appetite. we deem the deferral period suffi cient given the 
company’s risk profi le and horizon. Variable remuneration 
components may become subject to reduction or claw back 
if it is determined that the relevant employee or member of 
the Management board did not meet adequate norms of 
competence and appropriate behavior or was responsible 
for behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of the 
company’s position, in accordance with applicable law.
we do not award guaranteed variable remuneration to 
employees unless the guaranteed variable component is 
awarded in relation to hiring new staff, limited to the fi rst 
year of employment, and only if we have a sound and strong 
capital base. we do not award severance payments if there 
is a serious imputable act or negligence by the employee in 
the fulfi lment of his or her function or where an employee 
resigns voluntarily (unless this is the consequence of 
a serious imputable act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar 
handelen of nalaten) by the company). employees did not 
receive any shares or loans from the company as part of 
their compensation package in 2016. we do not provide any 
other ancillary benefi ts for any employee. we have not 
reserved or accrued any amounts to cover pension claims or 
retirement claims.

Remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board
Introduction
This section constitutes the remuneration report prescribed 
by best practice provision II.2.12 of the dutch corporate 
Governance code. The remuneration of, and other 
agreements with, the members of the Management board 
are required to be determined by the supervisory board with 
due observance of the General Remuneration Policy and 
applicable laws and regulations. The supervisory board has 
assessed the remuneration of the Management board 
members based on their performance in 2016.
The remuneration of our co-ceos and cfo consists of 
a relatively modest fi xed base salary and a variable, partially 
deferred, remuneration in cash. our cfo, Marcel Jongmans, 
took offi ce on 1 october 2016. as set out in the convening 
notice for the extraordinary General Meeting held on 
26 september 2016 in respect of his appointment, 
Marcel Jongmans was compensated for benefi ts he forfeited 
by leaving his previous employer. he was entitled to 
a one-off payment of € 150,000 and a one-off minimum 
bonus for performance year 2016 which (i) was pro-rated to 
his tenure in 2016, and (ii) depended on the size of, and be 
paid from, the aggregate bonus pool accruing for 
performance year 2016. The table below shows the total 
remuneration awarded to the individual members of the 
Management board over 2016.

Variable remuneration
based on actual performance over 2016, all members of the 
Management board were awarded a total combined variable 
remuneration of €4,002,625. The variable remuneration 
awards to the members of the Management board are 
determined on the basis of the following principles:
 
◾
firstly, the maximum variable remuneration is set by 
the supervisory board within the limits of the firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool for a given year. as set out 
above, the pool historically amounts to approximately 
36% of operating result and is directly contingent upon 
positive operating results. financial performance 
indicators are therefore integrated into this self- 
correcting mechanism: the variable remuneration of 
the members of the Management board will be a direct 
reflection of actual realized company performance.
 
◾
secondly, within those limits the variable remuneration 
is determined annually on the basis of a management-
assessment performance framework. This framework 
translates flow Traders’ strategic business objectives 
into predetermined, assessable performance criteria 
that can be influenced by the Management board’s 
performance within a balanced Performance 
scorecard. This scorecard is composed of four 
non-financial focus areas, which aim to robustly assess 
the Management board member’s performance within 
flow Traders’ operating environment and stakeholder 
interests. These four areas comprise Growth, external 
Relationships, Internal Processes / excellence, and 
People and culture. each year, targets are set for the 
following performance elements, which are assessed 
annually in order to determine management’s 
performance and variable remuneration:
reduced or forfeited entirely. In addition to the reduction 
and claw back provisions of the Remuneration act, dutch 
law and the dutch corporate Governance code provide that 
the remuneration of the members of the Management 
board may be reduced or they may be obliged to repay (part 
of) their variable remuneration to the company if certain 
circumstances apply.
Pursuant to the dutch corporate Governance code and 
applicable laws and regulations, any variable remuneration 
component conditionally awarded to a member of the 
Adjustments to variable remuneration
Variable remuneration to members of the Management 
board, is paid in cash in two instalments for Marcel 
Jongmans and three annual instalments for the co-ceos 
and may be reduced or clawed back under circumstances 
described in the Remuneration act. as explained in the 
section above on our global remuneration model, the 
deferred variable component acts as a first loss tranche to 
compensate any operating loss in the subsequent year, 
before such loss would impact shareholder equity. If the 
company incurs a loss, deferred variable remuneration is

Limited severance payments
we do not award severance payments to members of the 
Management board that exceed 100% of their annual fixed 
remuneration, and do not award severance payments if 
there is a serious imputable act or negligence by the 
employee in the fulfilment of their functions, where they 
resign voluntarily (unless this is the consequence of a serious 
imputable act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar handelen of 
nalaten) or failure by the company), and we do not intend to 
award such payments in the future. In addition, relevant 
limitations apply under the Remuneration act.
Remuneration of the members of the 
Supervisory Board
The General Meeting determines the remuneration of the 
members of the supervisory board following a proposal by 
the supervisory board. The remuneration of the members of 
the supervisory board consists of a fixed base salary and 
cannot be dependent upon the company’s results. 
none of the members of the supervisory board may receive 
shares, options for shares or similar rights to acquire shares 
as part of his or her remuneration. none of the members of 
the supervisory board may hold shares, options for shares or 
similar securities other than as a long-term investment. 
The members of the supervisory board may also not hold 
such securities, other than in accordance with the rules on 
holding or transacting in the company’s securities. Members 
of the supervisory board may not accept personal loans or 
guarantees from the company, other than in the normal 
course of business and subject to the prior approval of the 
supervisory board.
because of the nature of our business activities and the fast 
paced industry in which we operate, the supervisory board 
tracks actual performance of the Management board 
members and eligibility for variable remuneration 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year while 
performing a single, one-off, assessment at the end of the 
year as set out in the best practice provisions. Quarterly 
discussions take place between the Management board 
members and the Remuneration and appointment 
committee for this purpose. In this manner the supervisory 
board regularly assesses the performance indicators and 
the potential resulting variable remuneration for the 
Management board members. 
as mentioned, compensation of the members of the 
Management board is limited to a relatively modest fixed 
remuneration component and a variable component 
dependent on operating result being realized. They did not 
receive share-based remuneration or other elaborate 
incentive schemes. This limits the number of scenarios to be 
meaningfully assessed as prescribed by the best 
practice provisions.
No shares, pensions, loans and other benefits
In 2016 the members of the Management board did not 
receive any shares and no loans were granted by the 
company to the members of the Management board as part 
of their compensation package. we have not reserved or 
accrued any amounts to cover pension claims or retirement 
claims. we do not provide any other ancillary benefits for 
any member of the Management board.
Management board in a previous financial year which would, 
in the opinion of the supervisory board, produce an unfair 
result due to extraordinary circumstances during the period 
in which the predetermined performance criteria have been 
or should have been applied, the supervisory board will 
have the power to adjust the value downwards or upwards. 
In addition, the supervisory board will have the authority 
under the dutch corporate Governance code and applicable 
dutch law, including the Remuneration act, to recover any 
variable remuneration awarded from a member of the 
Management board on the basis of incorrect financial or 
other data (claw back). In addition, variable remuneration 
components may become subject to claw back and malus 
pursuant to the Remuneration act and related regulations.
Pursuant to dutch law, the supervisory board may 
furthermore adjust the variable remuneration (to the extent 
that it is subject to reaching certain targets and the 
occurrence of certain events) to an appropriate level if 
payment of the variable remuneration were to be 
unacceptable according to requirements of reasonableness 
and fairness.
Analyses carried out in respect of variable remuneration
best practice provisions II.2.1 and II.2.2 of the dutch 
corporate Governance code provide that scenario analyses 
are to be conducted in order to analyze the possible 
outcomes of the variable remuneration components. 
The variable remuneration of the members of the 
Management board is contingent upon a future, unknown, 
metric: the accrued firm-wide variable remuneration pool 
which itself depends on the operating result for the given 
financial year.

the supervisory board acts in accordance with the interests 
of the company and takes the relevant interests of the

consisting of a Management Board and a 
Supervisory Board. The Management Board is

company: two people must sign off on significant business 
decisions. The Management board is charged with managing 
the company, subject to the limitations set out in the 
articles of association and the Management board by-laws. 
The Management board is guided by the interests of the 
company and its business, taking into consideration the 
interests of the company’s stakeholders, including our 
employees and our shareholders. before the Management 
board can approve any resolutions entailing a significant 
change in the identity or nature of the company or what we 
do, it must obtain the approval of the General Meeting. 
The Management board also has to obtain the approval of 
the supervisory board for a number of resolutions specified 
in the Management board by-laws.

as well as their ultimate controlling persons, is able to 
benefit from the exemption from the dutch mandatory 
offer requirement set out in section 5:71 sub 1 (i) of the 
dutch financial supervision act (Wet op het Financieel 
Toezicht). The shareholders’ agreement terminates for any 
party if such party’s aggregate shareholding in the company 
(be it direct or indirect) falls below 3% of the company’s 
outstanding share capital and in case of, among other things, 
the company becoming subject to insolvency procedures, 
liquidation, delisting, a merger or spin-off (with the company 
as disappearing entity).
No dedicated take-over protection structures
flow Traders does not employ any of the following 
dedicated take-over protection structures: preference 
shares, depositary receipts or call options issued to vehicles 
conducive to protecting the company’s interest or 
independence.
Internal audit
during 2016 flow Traders has set up an internal audit 
function (Internal audit) at Group level. at flow Traders, 
Internal audit is not a box ticking exercise. It strives to be 
seen as ‘the improvement department’ by providing 
tangible benefits to the company as a whole, looking around 
the corner, identifying the right risks and asking the right 
questions: what could go wrong and how can we prevent it 
from happening?
The Internal audit team consists of the independent Group 
Internal auditor, reporting directly to the Management 
board and audit committee, assisted by two team members 
and external advisors where required. The internal audit 
and Javak Investments b.V. together continue to, directly or 
indirectly, hold more than 5% of the company’s shares, 
avalon holding b.V. and Javak Investments b.V. shall be 
entitled to jointly designate one supervisory board member 
for appointment. The relationship agreement also governs 
the composition of the supervisory board committees. 
The agreement terminates in respect of each of the 
shareholders, if such party’s aggregate shareholding in the 
company (be it direct, indirect or together with a permitted 
transferee) falls below 5% of the company’s outstanding 
share capital. In case of, among other things, the company 
becoming subject to insolvency procedures, liquidation, 
delisting, a merger or a spin-off (with the company as 
disappearing entity), the agreement automatically 
terminates.
Under the shareholders’ agreement governed by dutch law, 
avalon holding b.V., Javak Investments b.V. and the summit 
entities have agreed on certain arrangements in respect of 
their shareholding in the company. These arrangements 
include an obligation for each of the parties to vote in favor 
of the appointment of any individual designated by any of 
them as a member of the supervisory board in accordance 
with the terms of the relationship agreement (as described 
above). furthermore, the parties agreed to reserve the right 
to consult with each other and coordinate the exercise of 
their voting rights attached to their respective shares in the 
company. The shareholders’ agreement also contains 
arrangements in respect of a party’s disposal or transfer of 
shares in the company, including tag-along and permitted 
transfer provisions. as long as the parties to the 
shareholders’ agreement adhere to provisions set out 
therein and control in aggregate 30% or more of the voting

combined entities advised by summit Partners (summit 
entities) entered into a relationship agreement and 
a shareholders’ agreement. according to the afM’s register 
of substantial holdings and gross short positions these 
parties together controlled 37.13% of our shares (data as of 
31 december 2016). as a result of a transaction announced 
on 15 february 2017 which was completed on 20 february

the relationship between the parties thereto, which also 
includes the company. The agreement grants each of these 
shareholders a specific right to nominate or designate one 
supervisory board member for appointment (and 
replacement). This right expires, in respect of each relevant 
party, if such party ceases to, directly or indirectly, hold

Compliance and integrity
flow Traders commits to being in compliance with all 
relevant laws and regulations that apply to it, anywhere, 
including in respect of anti-corruption laws. Integrity and 
transparency is central to the way we operate our business, 
from our Management board and supervisory board to all 
our staff, regardless of their role. The company encourages 
an open culture within its organization and expects its 
employees to comply with applicable laws, regulations and 
internal policies. each employee is responsible for ensuring 
an honest and ethical conduct of business within the 
company. Please refer to the chapter flow Traders and 
society for more details on our anti-bribery, anti-corruption 
and anti-money laundering policies, our code of conduct 
and our whistle-blower Policy.
Compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
The dutch corporate Governance code defines a company 
as a long-term form of collaboration between the principal 
corporate bodies of a company. for us, these corporate 
bodies include the Management board, the supervisory 
board and the General Meeting. The Management board 
values and considers the interests of the various 
stakeholders involved. according to the dutch corporate 
Governance code, good corporate governance results in 
effective decision-making in a manner which enhances 
shareholder value and enables a company to maintain 
a culture of integrity, transparency, and trust. 
we acknowledge the importance of good corporate 
governance and endeavor to comply in general with the 
provisions of the dutch corporate Governance code and 
comply fully with it, with the exception of the following 
provisions: 
of the approval process for business proposals to ensure 
a clear understanding of the tax consequences. we have 
good standing relationships with the tax authorities in each 
region. we pro-actively manage our relationship with the tax 
authorities with the aim of minimizing the risk of challenge, 
dispute or damage that could have an impact on our 
credibility. we concluded a horizontal supervision 
agreement with the dutch tax authorities (horizontaal 
toezicht) with a view to further strengthening our 
transparent and professional relationship with the tax 
authorities. Tax laws, rules and interpretations are 
continuously subject to a changing social view towards tax 
and we cannot be certain of continued benefit from certain 
favorable tax regimes like among others the fsI schemes in 
singapore and innovation box regime in the netherlands. 
The key stakeholders in the Tax control framework are 
well-established and include the supervisory board, 
Managing board, finance & Tax department and external 
auditors. with the aforementioned stakeholders involved in 
the company’s tax policy process, it is able to assess and 
weigh the tax decision process for its business and 
stakeholders. 
flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local tax legislation. we do not use tax 
haven jurisdictions1 for tax avoidance purposes and carry out 
our business through entities in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. with this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the company can operate its business in 
line with its belief that it is part of the corporate social 
responsibility duty to pay taxes where it operates. for more 
information on our tax position, please refer to note 12 of 
the financial statements.
1 As defined by the OECD.
function is an integral part of our reporting and audit cycle, 
aligns its efforts with the external auditor and reports 
during each audit committee meeting. 
The Internal audit Plan 2016-2017 focuses on risk and 
trading systems and controls, operational resilience, data 
handling, profit performance reports and payments 
processes. The internal audit function can also carry out 
specific evaluations at the request of the Management 
board or the audit committee. 
Principles of financial reporting and  
tax policy
flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of its 
financial reporting and its relations with tax authorities 
globally. with regard to financial reporting, conservative 
accounting principles are being applied and one-offs must 
occur infrequently and be clearly documented. 
flow Traders operates a transparent and straightforward tax 
policy as we believe that this is of importance for running 
a sustainable business and delivering long-term value to all 
of the company’s stakeholders. for every business decision, 
tax aspects are presented and weighed as part of the 
decision making process. The commercial needs will in no 
circumstances override compliance with (tax) laws and 
strives to be compliant with the spirit of the law. 
The company supports transparency initiatives such as the 
country-by-country reporting and base erosion and Profit 
shifting from the oecd. for further details regarding the 
company’s tax policy, we refer to the ‘Tax Principles’ 
published on the company’s website. The tax function within 
the company will therefore provide appropriate input as part

two-tier board structure (structuurregime) may adopt a 
resolution to cancel the binding nature of a nomination 
for the appointment of a member of the Management 
board or of the supervisory board and/or a resolution 
to remove a member of the Management board or of 
the supervisory board by an absolute majority of the 
votes cast. according to the dutch corporate 
Governance code, it may be provided that this majority 
should represent a given proportion of the issued 
capital, which proportion may not exceed one-third. 
If this proportion of the capital is not represented at the 
meeting, but an absolute majority of the votes cast is in 
favor of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of a 
nomination or to remove a board member, a new 
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may 
be passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
regardless of the proportion of the capital represented 
at the meeting. In deviation of this best practice 
provision, the company’s articles of association 
prescribe that the General Meeting may pass a 
resolution to cancel the binding nature of a nomination 
for the appointment of a member of the Management 
board or of the supervisory board and/or a resolution 
to remove a member of the Management board or of 
the supervisory board by an absolute majority of the 
votes cast, representing more than 50% of the 
company’s issued capital. In addition, the company’s 
articles of association provide that if this quorum is not 
present or represented at the meeting, such resolution 
cannot be adopted and in order for such a resolution to 
be adopted, a new meeting should be convened in 
which more than 50% of the company’s issued capital is 
represented and an absolute majority of the votes are 
cast in favor of such resolution.

members of the Management board of the company 
prior to its conversion and because they represent 
shareholders of the company. our supervisory board 
profile provides that, given the highly specialized and 
competitive nature of the company’s business 
activities, certain members of the supervisory board 
should preferably have a broad and in-depth 
knowledge of its business activities and the fast paced 
environment in which it operates.
 
◾
Independence committee members 
best practice provision III.5.1, provides that a maximum 
of one member of each committee may not be 
independent within the meaning of best practice 
provision III.2.1 above. Given the number of members of 
the supervisory board that are not independent, each 
of the supervisory board committees comprise of more 
than one non-independent supervisory board member. 
for further information see explanation on best 
practice provision II.2.1 above. olivier bisserier, as 
chairman of the audit committee, is a financial expert 
as set out in the dutch corporate Governance code. 
The chairman of the audit committee and the 
chairman of the Remuneration and appointment 
committee both qualify as independent under 
provisions of the dutch corporate Governance code. 
The Trading and Risk committee and Technology 
committee have been established to cater for the 
monitoring of and advising on specific business related 
topics. These committees are chaired by the founders 
and former Management board members of the 
company.

Analyses carried out in respect of variable 
 compensation 
best practice provisions II.2.1 and II.2.2 of the dutch 
corporate Governance code provide that scenario 
analyses are to be conducted in order to analyze the 
possible outcomes of the variable compensation 
components. The variable remuneration for the 
members of the Management board is contingent upon 
a future, unknown, metric: the accrued firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool which itself depends on 
operating result for the given financial year. because of 
the nature of our business activities and the fast paced 
industry in which we operate, the supervisory board 
tracks actual performance of the Management board 
members and eligibility for variable compensation 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year 
while performing a single, one-off assessment at the 
end of the year as set out in the best practice 
provisions. Quarterly discussions take place between 
the Management board members and the 
Remuneration and appointment committee for this 
purpose. In this manner the supervisory board regularly 
assesses the performance indicators and the potential 
resulting variable compensation for the Management 
board members.
 
◾
Independence Supervisory Board members 
best practice provision III.2.1, provides that all 
supervisory board members, with the exception of not 
more than one person, shall be independent within the 
meaning of best practice provision III.2.2. Jan van Kuijk, 
Roger hodenius and han sikkens were attracted for 
their role as supervisory board members because of 
their specific business-related expertise. They do not 
qualify as independent under the provisions of the

Corporate Governance Code 2017
on 8 december 2016, the dutch corporate governance 
committee published the final version of a revision of the 
dutch corporate Governance code. The new dutch 
corporate Governance code will apply to financial years 
starting on or after 1 January 2017. as such, all references in 
this report are based on and refer to the old code. The new 
dutch corporate Governance code is structured around 
a number of themes as opposed to the current dutch 
corporate Governance code which is based on a functional 
division of roles and responsibilities within a company.
flow Traders welcomes the updates to the dutch corporate 
Governance code and supports the emphasis of the new 
dutch corporate Governance code on topics such as long 
term value creation and the importance of culture. 
flow Traders already complies with the vast majority of the 
provisions of the new dutch corporate Governance code 
and will use the year 2017, to the extent required, to assess 
the need for a further alignment of its organizational 
structure and disclosures with a view to its compliance with 
the new dutch corporate Governance code or the 
explanation of any deviation from the new dutch corporate 
Governance code’s provisions.

vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its seat (statutaire zetel) 
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, having its registered office at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 1018 LL 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Trade Register of the Chamber of 
Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, afdeling Handelsregister) under number 34294936.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is a leading global technology-enabled liquidity provider 
that specializes in exchange traded products (ETPs). The Group’s goal is to be a leading 
ETP-focused liquidity provider.
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the annual period ended 31 December 
2016 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders N.V., its subsidiaries and associates. 
The annual financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company’s Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board on 16 March 2016 subject to adoption by the General Meeting 
of shareholders.
2. Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption.
3. Basis of preparation 
a) 
Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (‘IFRS-EU’). IFRS-EU provides several options in accounting principles. The Group’s 
accounting principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding the options available are set out in 
the section ‘Significant accounting policies’ below.
b) 
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except 
for the following items and unless otherwise indicated:
 
◾
financial assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with changes 
recognized in profit or loss; 
 
◾
available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses which are 
recognized in profit or loss.
The balance sheet per 31 December 2015 included a reclassification between ‘financial assets/
liabilities held for trading’ to ‘investments available for sale’ and ‘liabilities at fair value’. This 
reclassification relates to certain positions which classify as available for sale assets. As both 
positions off-set each other, the results on this positions are recognized directly in profit and 
loss.
c) 
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the Group’s 
functional currency. All financial information presented in euros has been rounded to the 
nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
d) 
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to form opinions and make 
estimates and assumptions that influence the reported values of assets and liabilities and of 
income and expenditure. The actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are constantly assessed. Revisions of estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. For more details, we refer you to 
the chapter on Fair values of financial instruments.
e) 
Principles for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows
The consolidated statement of cash flows is based on the indirect method.
The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, including trading activities, investment 
activities and financing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of

acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments other than in the course 
of operations, as well as acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property and 
equipment. Movements to the extent that those have not resulted in cash flows are eliminated. 
4. Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
a) 
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group entities.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from 
intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated 
against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee if it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date when control ceases. 
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.
Investments in associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or 
joint control, over its financial and operating activities. Control or significant influence follows 
from facts and circumstances, but there is a rebuttable presumption that significant influence 
when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized 
initially at cost. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the 
carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part thereof, is 
reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that 
the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair 
value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized 
in profit or loss.

d) 
Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are originated. 
All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) 
are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or 
issue.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
 
◾
loans and receivables; 
 
◾
investments held-to-maturity; 
 
◾
available for sale investments; and
 
◾
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and within the following category as:
 
◾held for trading;
 
◾designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan 
commitments, into the following categories:
 
◾
financial liabilities held for trading; and
 
◾
other financial liabilities.
Trading assets and liabilities
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group acquires or incurs 
principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of 
a portfolio that is managed together for short-term profit.
b) 
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of the Group at 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the foreign currency 
difference recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising on the translation of available for 
sale equity investments are recognized in other comprehensive income unless the instrument 
is impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at 
fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based 
on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisition, are translated into euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. 
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euro at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in 
the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of equity. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the 
cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to 
profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
c) 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three 
months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.

Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value 
in the statement of financial position, with transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. 
All changes in fair value are recognized as part of net trading income in profit or loss. 
Trading assets and liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except 
that non-derivative trading assets, other than those designated at fair value through profit or 
loss on initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as 
available for sale or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. 
Available for sale financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly 
 attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other 
than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available for sale debt 
instruments, are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value 
reserve in equity. When an investment is derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any directly 
 attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes 
a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of offset is agreed 
between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS-EU, for 
gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading 
activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at 
that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market 
for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the 
transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group 
determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the 
fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or 
liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then 
the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that 
difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument 
but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the 
transaction is closed out.
The Group valuates its daily trading positions based on theoretical prices whereby the price 
differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those theoretical prices can differ 
from quoted market prices. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department monitors whether all 
differences can be substantiated.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant items of 
property and equipment are as follows:
 
◾
hardware: 5 years;
 
◾
office fixtures: 5 years;
 
◾
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date 
and adjusted if appropriate. 
f) 
Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the estimated 
useful lives of each component. The estimated useful live of significant intangible assets 
is 5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognized and in subsequent years measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of equity-accounted investees is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-
accounted investee as a whole.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
g) 
Leased assets
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as financial leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount 
equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting 
policy applicable to that asset. 
Other leases are operating leases and are not recognized in the Group’s statement of financial 
position.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the Group on the basis 
of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price 
that would be received to sell a net long position or paid to transfer a net short position for 
a particular risk exposure. Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the 
reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e) 
Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. 
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as the difference 
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognized in 
profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over 
the estimated useful lives of each component. Leased assets under financial leases are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed 
reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU 
(group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no 
impairment loss had been recognized.
i) 
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or 
(profit-sharing) structures if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this 
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
j) 
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
h) 
Impairment 
Non-derivative financial assets
A financial asset not classified as at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each 
reporting date for indications of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective 
evidence of a loss event which impacts the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or delinquency by 
a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not 
consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in 
the payment status of borrowers or issuers, or economic conditions that correlate with defaults 
or the disappearance of an active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an 
equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective 
evidence of impairment.
Impairment losses on available for sale financial assets are recognized by reclassifying the 
losses accumulated in the fair value reserve from equity to profit or loss. The loss that is  
reclassified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of 
any principal repayment and amortization, and the current fair value, less of impairment loss 
recognized previously in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the 
recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are 
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is 
recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the 
impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. 
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based 
on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and management 
judgement. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause the Group to 
change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities or the collectability of 
tax assets. Such changes will impact tax expense in the period that such a change in estimate is 
made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis 
or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized  simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
5. Operating segments
The Group has the following regions in which it operates via its subsidiaries in Europe (the 
Netherlands, Romania), the Americas (the United States of America) and Asia (Singapore). 
The Group’s trading assets and liabilities attributable to each segment are reported to 
management on the basis of net liquidity. Consequently, the reported total assets in each 
segment are net of the segment’s financial liabilities held for trading and trading payables.
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognized as finance cost.
k) 
Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease as lease expenses.
l) 
Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial expenses 
related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and are therefore 
directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading income.
m) Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized 
in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items 
recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to 
tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any 
withholding tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
 
◾
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit 
or loss; 
 
◾
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in the foreseeable future; and
 
◾
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is 
permitted provided the new revenue standard, IFRS 15, is applied on the same date. Lessees 
must adopt IFRS 16 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. 
The Group does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 16, as the amount of the operational leases 
outstanding are limited and short term the impact is expected to be immaterial.
IAS 12 Income Taxes 
In January 2016, through issuing amendments to IAS 12, the IASB clarified the accounting 
treatment of deferred tax assets of debt instruments measured at fair value for accounting, 
but measured at cost for tax purposes. The amendment is effective from 1 January 2017. 
As there are no deferred tax assets driven by the measurement of debt instruments. 
The proposed amendment is therefore expected to be nil.
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows
In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows with the 
intention to improve disclosures of financing activities and help users to better understand the 
reporting entities’ liquidity positions. Under the new requirements, entities will need to disclose 
changes in their financial liabilities as a result of financing activities such as changes from cash 
flows and non-cash items (e.g., gains and losses due to foreign currency movements). 
The amendment is effective from 1 January 2017. The Group is currently evaluating the impact.
Other new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.
7. Fair values of financial instruments
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the 
following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in 
determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
6. New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for 
annual periods beginning after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements. Those that may be relevant to the Group are set out below. 
The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for 
financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge 
accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early 
application permitted. 
Given the nature of the Group’s operations and the fact that the trading portfolio is valued at 
fair value, the impact on the Group’s financial statements is immaterial.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when 
revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 
Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. 
IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, permitting 
early adoption. Given the nature of the Group’s operations the impact on the financial 
statements is expected to be nil.
IFRS 16 Leases 
The IASB issued the new standard for accounting for leases - IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. 
The new standard does not significantly change the accounting for leases for lessors. However, 
it does require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, with 
the corresponding right of use assets. Lessees must apply a single model for all recognized 
leases, but will have the option not to recognize ‘short-term’ leases and leases of ‘low-value’ 
assets. Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern for recognized leases will be similar to 
today’s financial lease accounting, with interest and depreciation expense recognized 
separately in the statement of profit or loss.

Valuation models 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, depending on the 
inputs used for making the measurements.
 
◾
Level 1: inputs that are quoted, unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical 
instruments;
 
◾
Level 2: inputs, other than within Level 1, that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valuated using: 
quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical 
or similar instruments in markets that are considered inactive; or other valuation 
techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable market data; 
 
◾
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the 
valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a significant effect on the 
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valuated based on 
quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or 
assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the 
price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly 
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date.
The Group uses widely recognized valuation techniques and models (including net present value 
models, BlackScholes option pricing models and comparisons with similar instruments for which 
market observable prices exist) for determining the fair value of common, simple financial 
instruments that use only observable market data and require little management judgement 
and estimation. Observable prices or model inputs (including risk-free and benchmark interest 
rates and credit spreads used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign 
currency exchange rates, equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and 
correlations) are usually available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-
traded derivatives and simple over-the-counter derivatives. Availability of observable market 
prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and thus 
reduces the uncertainty associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable 
market prices and inputs varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes 
based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in determining appropriate portfolio-level 
adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask 
spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. Similarly, 
when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, it takes into account any existing 
arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the 
counterparty).
Valuation framework
The Group has a control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This 
framework includes a Risk and Mid-Office department which is independent of the Trading 
department and reports directly to the Management Board. The Risk and Mid-Office department 
has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading and all significant fair 
value measurements. The daily reconciliation of the positions and prices between the prime 
brokers and the Trading department is most important.
The prime brokers of the Group provide electronic position statements on a daily basis, which are 
uploaded automatically into the Group’s databases. The Group and its prime brokers agreed when 
files will be available and methods for transmission and communication. All data is normalized by 
the Group so it can be used in multiple internal systems. The information is mainly used for daily 
independent reconciliation of positions and prices, resulting in profit and loss accounts.
The following reconciliations are executed on a daily basis:
 
◾
reconciliation of the positions - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles the positions 
of the Trading department with information provided by the prime brokers. All differences 
are reconciled and agreed by the Trading department of the Group and the prime brokers;
 
◾
reconciliation of prices - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles prices as provided 
by the Trading Department with those of the prime brokers and/or data from external data 
vendors. All differences are reconciled and the Risk and Mid-Office department makes 
sure that any required follow up action is taken, either by the prime broker or the Trading 
department. Therefore, all prices are checked with independent sources.
Results of these reconciliation processes are communicated and agreed with Heads of Trading, 
the Risk and Mid-Office department and the Management Board on a daily basis.

a) 
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The Group mainly trades on regulated and active markets. The financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading are carried at fair value, based whenever possible on quoted market prices, as 
published by exchanges, market data vendors and prime brokers. 
The valuation of trading positions, both the long and the short positions, is determined by 
referencing to last traded prices from similar instruments from the exchanges at the reporting 
date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are carried at fair value, 
based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted market prices. The theoretical prices 
reflect price adjustments primarily caused by the fact that the Group continuously prices its 
financial assets and liabilities based on all available information. This includes prices for 
identical and near-identical positions, as well as the prices for securities underlying the Group’s 
positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on which the financial asset or 
liability is traded closes. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department monitors whether all 
price adjustments can be substantiated with market inputs and checks the theoretical price 
independently. Consequently, such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to determine fair 
value. 
b) 
Available for sale investments
The fair value of available for sale investments is determined by reference to their quoted 
closing bid price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique 
and are classified as level 2.
c) 
Other receivables 
The carrying value of other receivables with a maturity of less than one year is assumed to 
approximate their fair values.

The Group’s consolidated effective tax rate for 2016 is 16%. The change in effective tax rate 
was caused mainly by the following factor: ◾ 
 
◾
Certain costs that were settled in 2015 were initially considered non-deductible for tax 
purposes, but have been approved by the tax authorities to be deductible, resulting a 
positive one-off benefit on the Group’s effective tax rate of approximately 4% in 2016, 
without this one-off the effective tax rate would have been around 20%.
No tax was recognized in other comprehensive income in 2016 and 2015.

Borrowings
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to facilitate the trading 
activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of financial instruments). The drawn 
amounts on these facilities continuously fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given 
moment.
The Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities with ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V. 
(ABN AMRO Clearing), totaling € 2,450 million. In addition, the Group entered into interest-
bearing credit facilities for portfolio margin financing with Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
(BAML). These facilities can be modified or terminated at any time. The facilities are exclusively 
for the financing of positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary course of the 
trading activities using ABN AMRO Clearing or BAML as prime broker, respectively. The facilities 
are collateralized by cash, as well as our trading accounts held with these financial institutions. 
In addition, the Group is required to post certain minimum capital with the respective prime 
broker as calculated by the prime broker. 
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin requirements 
(representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is variable and calculated on a daily 
basis depending on portfolio size and composition) in cash or securities as security for our 
positions held with the relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities the Group is required to comply with 
a net liquidation balance that exceeds the haircut calculated by the prime broker. The minimum 
net liquidation value is € 40 million. Both the net liquidation balance and haircut are variable 
and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio size and composition. The main 
covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to-loan size (variable and calculated on a daily 
basis, depending on portfolio composition). In addition, they require us to maintain a solvency 
ratio of at least 4%, calculated by adjusted shareholders equity divided by credit limit.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with financial 
statements and other information, including information on our trading activities and trading 
counterparties, and permission to inspect our books and records. Furthermore, they require us 
to maintain all relevant authorizations and memberships required in order to conduct our 
Part of the intangible assets were obtained under a financial lease. The net carrying amount of 
leased Intangible assets was € 360,000 at 31 December 2016 (2015: € 340,000). Please refer to 
note 24 for more information about the commitments related to those contracts.
Goodwill
In December 2010 the Group obtained control of TradeSense Solutions B.V. and its subsidiary 
Flow Traders Technologies SRL (formerly TradeSense Solutions SRL), a software development 
company with special focus on trading in electronic markets. The goodwill amounted to 
€ 502,000.

Ordinary shares
Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to dividends and are entitled to one vote 
per share at general meetings of the Company. 
Total authorized capital of the Company is € 10 million consisting of 100 million shares of which 
currently 46,534,500 shares are issued. The nominal value per share is € 0.10 each, and 
therefore the issued and paid up capital amounts to € 4,653,000.
Shares acquired by participants in 2015 as set out on page 22 are subject to a lock-up period. 
When a participant leaves the Company before the end of the lock-up period, the participant 
must offer any such unreleased shares to the Company at the lower of the price paid by the 
participant or the market price. During 2016, a third-party broker sold shares offered by leaving 
participants in the market during open periods, resulting in an increase of share premium of 
€ 1.6 million. Total share premium therefore amounted € 152.5 million
Currency translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation 
of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve comprises the fair value movements on all investments available for 
sale of the Group.
General distributions
Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the company’s Articles of Association, the Management Board, with 
the approval of the Supervisory Board, has decided that of the profit for 2016 (totaling  
€ 91.9 million), an amount of € 33.8 million shall be added to the reserves. The remaining 
amount of € 58.2 million is at the disposal of the General Meeting of Shareholders (General 
Meeting).
Dividends
It is proposed to the General Meeting that a total cash dividend of € 1.25 per share will be paid 
out to shareholders for the financial year 2016, subject to a 15% dividend withholding tax. 
An interim cash dividend of €0.55 per share was paid out on 7 September 2016. This means that 
the final cash dividend proposal to the General Meeting of 24 May 2017 is € 0.70 per share.
26. Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)
Description of the Stock Appreciation Rights
During 2009 and 2011 the Group granted 28,080 and 24,441 Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), 
respectively, to eligible senior employees that entitled them to a cash payment after 6 years of 
service after the grant date or earlier, subject to applicable vesting arrangements. In 2015, the 
Company cancelled and settled the SARs as part of the listing of its ordinary shares. 
The Company repurchased all SARs from each of the participants assuming 100% vesting. 
The calculation of the settlement amounts paid to the participants was based on the average 
of the opening price and the closing price of the shares of the first day of trading. Settlement of 
the SARs occurred fully in cash. After repurchase of the SARs, the Company terminated the 
SARs scheme and no further rights or obligations are currently outstanding vis-a-vis the 
participants. The schedule on the next page only shows the 2015 position.

The Group manages credit risk through its Risk and Mid-Office department that provide 
specific guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit risk. 
Policies include amongst others:
 
◾
limits for individual product types;
 
◾
limits per counterparty;
 
◾
limits on the duration of the exposure;
 
◾
limits for settlement types;
 
◾
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty exposures are 
monitored on a intra-day basis. 
During 2016, the Group observed no significant concentration of credit risks towards single 
 counterparties and geographically there was no concentration of credit risk. 
Based on the Group’s counterparty credit risk monitoring the Group believes that no 
impairment is necessary in respect of trading and other receivables.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial liabilities that:
 
◾
are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
 
◾
 are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that 
covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase 
agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. Similar financial instruments 
include derivatives, sales and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase 
agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending agreements. Financial instruments 
such as loans and deposits are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the 
statement of financial position. This is because they create a right to offset recognized 
amounts for the parties to the agreement that is enforceable only following an event of 
31. Financial risk management
Overview
The Group is amongst others exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
 
◾
credit risk;
 
◾
market risk;
 
◾
liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s 
management of capital.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the settlement of 
off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. These amounts 
significantly exceed expected loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes 
into account the likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:
CARRYING AMOUNT
2016
2015
Cash and cash equivalents

1,925
Trading receivables
1,127,374
1,161,238
Other receivables
12,307
9,160
Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are guaranteed by the 
central counterparty or clearing house related to that exchange. Members of these clearing 
houses are required to deposit substantial amounts of cash, bonds or equities as guarantee for 
any failure to settlement of trading.

default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties or following other 
predetermined events. In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on 
a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can receive and grant 
collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in respect of the following 
transactions:
 
◾
derivatives;
 
◾
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
 
◾
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in 
respect of derivatives (including swaps). Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms 
including, where appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities 
received/granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction, but 
have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each party the right to 
terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure to post collateral.

Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial instrument 
fluctuating because of changes in factors including but not limited to such as interest rates, 
volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and equity prices. The Risk and 
Mid-Office department monitors market risk exposure on a continuous basis (including 
intraday). Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated risk for the Group, limit 
breaches, if any, will trigger action from the Risk and Mid-Office department in order to reduce 
the risk. 
In addition to the Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily. The applicable haircut and margins are computed by the Group’s prime 
brokers. The Risk and Mid-Office department computes the haircut using internal models 
enabling intra-day monitoring. Limits are set on both capital- and credit usage.
Long and short trading positions include securities and derivatives such as: shares, American 
depositary receipts (‘ADRs’), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (‘FRAs’), 
exchange-traded products (‘ETP’). All traded financial instruments are liquid instruments. 
Therefore, the portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame and with limited 
costs.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize the risk for market movements and 
does not engage in long and/or short only positions. The direction of market movements, i.e. 
what the Group considers directional market risk, is not relevant for the Group because of this 
long/short trading strategy. Because of the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed. 
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and 
settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are captured in the risk 
and margin requirements which the Group has to post at its prime brokers and clearing firms. 
The consolidated margin and haircut requirements over 2016 is shown in the Capital 
management paragraph. The haircut set out in the graph below reflects the mandatory capital 
requirement of the prime brokers. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk 
close to zero remains as a result of inefficiencies in the models of the prime brokers. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the euro, but also 
United States dollars and Singapore dollars. 
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well as net results 
of these foreign operations during the year.
The Group manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency. 
The Group does not use financial instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net 
investments in foreign operations or net results of foreign operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial instruments. The Group 
is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches of arranged interest rates of assets 
and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These 
limits ensure that interest rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and 
hedging strategies used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. 
All financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair value on 
the balance sheet. The Group is engaged in high velocity liquidity provision and therefore all 
positions held on the balance sheet are short term and, in addition, are all listed on exchanges 
and therefore liquid and tradable.

As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility available to 
facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the balance sheet. In order to match the 
liquidity and short holding period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate 
payable, which is floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact 
that the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short positions and 
in the EFP of the future. 
Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as the Group’s 
investments in available for sale securities. In addition, for its option positions, the implied 
volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk factor. Other factors to consider are 
time and dividend expectations. 
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual positions per 
product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the size of the exposure, concen-
trations, pricing and valuation parameters and natural hedging between these long and short 
positions.
As the Group is active in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in 
underlying values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero. 
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and margins are computed 
by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis measures all positions, individual and 
correlated, and reflects the different risk components. The third party haircut calculation 
confirms the internal assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is 
exposed to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under Market risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

Liquidity and capital resources
Beside equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the prime brokers 
through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well as cash generated from our 
operating activities. As of 31 December 2016, the Group held € 2.7 million in cash and cash 
equivalents compared to € 1.9 million as of 31 December 2015. These balances are maintained 
primarily to support operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient 
short-term access to liquidity, and capital expenditures. 
The Group maintains a highly liquid balance sheet, with a large portion of its total assets 
consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable securities and short-term trading receivables 
(arising from securities transactions). 
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intra-day basis and maintains significant 
portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to facilitate trading. These facilities 
are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as well as all financial assets in accounts held at the 
respective prime brokers. The Group has no outstanding borrowings other than the portfolio 
financing facilities with prime brokers.
Capital management
The Management Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base well above the required 
margins in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Management Board monitors the return on its capital as well 
as the level of dividends to its shareholders.
The Group is prudentially supervised by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, DNB). 
In addition, as its Dutch trading subsidiary is a registered investment firm dealing on own 
account in its capacity of market maker, the Group is subject to the rules and regulations of the 
Dutch Financial Services Act (Wet op het Financieel Toezicht) and, as a member of various 
venues, the Group is also subject to rules and regulations of the exchanges. 
If a firm fails to maintain the required capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation or 
registration by the applicable regulatory agency, and suspension or expulsion by these 
regulators could ultimately lead to the Group’s liquidation. Additionally, these rules may have 
the effect of prohibiting a proprietary trading firm from distributing or withdrawing capital and 
requiring prior notice to and approval from DNB for certain capital withdrawals. 
The available capital in the trading companies is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that 
requirements are met at all times and sufficient capital is available to support the Group’s 
strategy.
During 2016, the Group’s capital was above the regulatory minimum requirements.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
Capital requirements 
The Group’s regulators and prime brokers require certain levels of capital, which are managed 
by the Group in order to maintain net liquidity (which represents the value of our trading 
positions, principally long and short positions in equity securities, plus cash and cash 
equivalents) in excess of our various capital requirements at all times.

Prime broker capital requirements 
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain certain minimum capital levels. Prime brokers 
use different internal systems to calculate required capital amounts (e.g., the so-called 
‘internal haircut model’ and the so-called ‘margin based approach model’, both intending to 
ensure sufficient levels of risk allowances) and have different limits structure, pre-funding 
possibilities and cut-off times for wiring capital. The aggregate capital that is required to 
maintain by the prime brokers is significantly in excess of the actual risk exposure, principally 
due to (i) the offsetting legs of a transaction sometimes being cleared through different prime 
brokers and therefore each leg requiring a margin to be posted separately and therefore no 
offsets are applicable across prime brokers, irrespective of the overall risk exposure to our 
business and (ii) margin requirements of its prime brokers being affected by the sophistication 
of their models (which might not correspond to our models) and the regulatory requirements 
applicable to them.
The following table sets forth our net liquidity, capital required to be posted by our prime 
brokers and our excess liquidity as of the dates indicated:

As shown in the graphs above under Market risks, during 2016 all prime broker minimum capital 
level requirements are met for all the trading subsidiaries.
Regulatory capital requirements
The Company and our subsidiary Flow Traders B.V. are subject to separate regulatory capital 
requirements in the Netherlands and our subsidiary Flow Traders U.S. LLC is subject to 
regulatory capital requirements in the United States. Flow Traders Asia Pte. Ltd. is exempt from 
regulatory capital requirements.

capital. Moreover, Flow Traders U.S. LLC is required to notify the SEC, FINRA and other 
regulators prior to repaying subordinated borrowings, paying dividends and making loans to its 
parent, affiliates or employees, or otherwise entering into transactions, which, if executed, 
would result in a reduction of 30% or more of its excess net capital (net capital less minimum 
requirement).

During 2016 we have allocated additional capital to US LLC as we started trading more capital 
inefficiency assets classes such as fixed income.
Singapore regulatory capital requirements 
The Singapore trading subsidiary is exempt from regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, its 
entire equity can be interpreted as excess regulatory capital. Such regulatory excess can be 
used for other purposes within the Group, including covering capital requirements (prime 
broker or regulatory) in other trading subsidiaries.
Subsequent events
No material subsequent events have occurred since 31 December 2016 that require recognition 
or disclosure in this year’s financial statements.
Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements could result in sanctions, including 
citations, fines, limits to our trading and revocation of a regulatory license.
Dutch regulatory capital requirements 
The regulatory capital requirement prescribed by the Dutch Central Bank in respect of Flow 
Traders B.V. and the Company is deemed to be satisfied if the regulatory capital of Flow Traders 
B.V. and the Company is at least equal to their last reviewed or audited equity by our external 
auditor. The following table sets forth regulatory capital, regulatory capital requirements and

U.S. regulatory capital requirements 
The SEC and FINRA impose rules on Flow Traders U.S. LLC, as a registered U.S. broker-dealer, 
that require notification when regulatory capital levels fall below certain pre-defined criteria. 
These rules also dictate the ratio of debt-to-equity in Flow Traders U.S. LLC’s regulatory capital 
composition and constrain its ability to expand its business under certain circumstances. These 
regulations also prohibit repaying subordinated borrowings, paying cash dividends, making 
loans to the firm’s parent, affiliates or employees, or otherwise entering into transactions which 
would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than 120% of its required minimum

Notes to the parent company financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euros, unless stated otherwise.
General
With reference to the income statement of the parent Company, the exemption pursuant to 
Section 402 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code was applied.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the determination  
of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and 
determination of the result for its parent Company financial statements, the Group applies the 
option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the 
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result 
(hereinafter referred to as principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent company 
financial statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS-EU financial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has significant influence, are 
measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated statements chapter 1 to 4 for 
a description of the Group’s IFRS-EU principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Group’s share in the results of these 
participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the transfer of assets and liabilities 
between (i) the Group and its participating interests on (ii) between participating interests 
themselves, are not recognized.

Report on the audit of the financial statements 2016 included in the

We have audited the financial statements 2016 of Flow Traders N.V., based in Amsterdam. 
The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements.
In our opinion:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
financial position of Flow Traders N.V. as at 31 December 2016, and of its result and its cash 
flows for 2016 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The consolidated financial statements comprise: 
 
◾
The consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016 
 
◾
The following statements for 2016: the consolidated statements of profit and loss, other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows

◾

◾

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsi-
bilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders N.V. in accordance with the Verordening inzake de 
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Profes-
sional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant 
independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the 
Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.  
MATERIALITY
Materiality
€ 5 million
Benchmark applied
5% of pre-tax income (rounded)
Explanation
We applied pre-tax income as this benchmark is an 
important metric for the financial performance of  
Flow Traders N.V.
We have also taken misstatements into account and/or possible misstatements that in our 
opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of € 250 thousand, which 
are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016 104
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.
Risk
Our audit approach
Fair value measurement of financial instruments (note 7 of the financial statements)
Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of 
financial instruments is based on internally 
determined theoretical prices, which are 
also used for quoting purposes. As such, 
valuation can be different than the closing 
prices at the various stock exchanges, for 
example due to market illiquidity and the 
opening hours of the stock exchanges.
The fair values recorded inherently are 
estimates and could be biased. Therefore, 
we have identified the valuation of 
financial instruments as a significant risk 
within our audit.
We obtained an understanding of the 
valuation process, including verifications 
done by the risk and middle office 
department. We performed sample testing 
on the valuation of individual positions by 
comparing prices and underlying 
information used for valuation to external 
sources. We evaluated the fair value 
hierarchy of financial instruments and 
developments therein since prior year. 
Furthermore, we inspected the financial 
statements for compliance and 
consistency with IFRS 7 on disclosure 
requirements for financial instruments.
Risk
Our audit approach
Revenue recognition (note 9 of the financial statements)
Revenue recognition is perceived as 
embedding a higher inherent risk for our 
financial statements’ audit. Furthermore, 
net trading income at Flow Traders is 
identified as a significant account and
may include unusual or complex revenue 
transactions. 
We inspected Flow Traders’ policy related 
to revenue recognition. We tested the 
design and existence on the trading, risk 
and middle Office and finance processes. 
We verified revenues and cash positions 
with external party statements. 
We performed substantive testing over 
significant, unusual and/or one-off 
transactions. Finally, we performed 
procedures in relation to period end 
cut-off testing.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders N.V. Amsterdam is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of 
this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Flow Traders N.V. 
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities located in Singapore and the 
United States, hence those locations where trading activities are being performed. We have: 
 
◾
Performed audit procedures ourselves at group entities Flow Traders N.V. and Flow Traders 
B.V.
 
◾
Used the work of other auditors when auditing entities Flow Traders Asia Pte. LTD and 
Flow Traders U.S. LLC
 
◾
Performed specific audit procedures at other group entities
By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional 
procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit 
evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signif-
icance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to 
the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters 
discussed.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016 105
Report on other information included in the annual report
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report 
contains other information that consists of:
 
◾
The management board’s report
 
◾
Other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
 
◾
Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements
 
◾
Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained 
through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the 
other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we 
comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch 
Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is less than the scope of those 
performed in our audit of the financial statements.
Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the 
management board’s report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and 
other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Risk
Our audit approach
Reliability and continuity of IT (section managing operational and IT risk)
With Flow Traders’ trading activities taking 
place through its proprietary technology 
platform and in a highly automated 
environment, Flow Traders is highly 
dependent on the reliability and continuity 
of its IT for executing its strategy. 
In combination with our legally required 
procedures as external auditor of Flow 
Traders, we have identified reliability and 
continuity of IT as key audit matter. 
We have obtained an understanding of the 
IT infrastructure. We evaluated the IT 
governance structure and IT monitoring 
controls. We walked through and tested 
the design and operating effectiveness of 
IT general controls and significant IT 
application controls relevant for the 
financial statements. Furthermore, we 
evaluated progress of various IT initiatives 
within Flow Traders and inspected IT 
testing performed by Flow Traders and/or 
external parties.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016 106
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on 
our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism 
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements 
and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.,: 
 
◾
Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control
 
◾Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
 
◾Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
 
◾Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to 
continue as a going concern
 
◾
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures
 
◾
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V. on 19 May 2016, as of 
the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor since that date.
Description of responsibilities for the financial statements
Responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing 
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting 
frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose 
events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in the financial statements. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. 
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means 
we may not have detected all material errors and fraud.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016 107
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, 
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and 
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities 
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information 
or specific items.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circum-
stances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

will prove to be correct. Given the risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Accordingly, other 
than as required by applicable law or the rules of the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise. Any forward-looking statements should not be regarded as 
a representation or warranty by us or any other person with respect to the achievement of the results 
set out in such statements or that the underlying assumptions used will in fact be the case. If any of 
these risks and uncertainties materialize, or if any of our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect,

“estimate”, “believe”, “intend”, “plan”, “predict”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “should”, “continue”, “expect” and 
similar expressions, but these expressions are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. 
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important 
factors that could cause circumstances or our actual results, performance or achievements to be 
materially different from any future circumstances, results, performance or achievements expressed or 
implied by such statements. Such factors include, among other things, reduced levels of overall trading 
volume and lower margins; dependence upon prime brokers, ETP issuers, trading counterparties, CCPs 
and custodians; losing access to an important exchange or other trading venue; occurrence of a systemic 
market event; incurrence of trading losses; failures or disruption of our trading platform or our or 
third-party technical infrastructure; risks associated with operational elements of our business and 
trading generally; ineffective risk management systems, processes and strategies; intense competition in 
our business; dependence on continued access to sources of liquidity; capacity constraints of computer 
and communications systems; dependence on third-party software, infrastructure or availability of 
certain software systems; damage to our reputation and the reputation of our industry; loss of key staff 
or failure to attract and retain other highly skilled professionals; changes to applicable regulatory 
requirements; compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including those specific to 
our industry; enhanced media and regulatory attention and its impact upon public perception of us or of 
companies in our industry; and other risks.
