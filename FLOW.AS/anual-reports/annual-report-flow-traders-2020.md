Message of the Management Board
The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated market impacts 
were the key developments in 2020. Our primary focus 
throughout the year was on safeguarding the health and 
wellbeing of our people and their families, while ensuring 
our business operations could continue securely as normal 
and without interruption. This involved launching our 
business continuity plan (BCP) in the ﬁ rst quarter, leading to 
the vast majority of employees working from home and the 
creation of back-up trading locations across our three 
regions. 
Our ability to adapt and respond to the pandemic has again 
demonstrated the resilience of our systems and 
infrastructure, the strength of the company culture with 
true global collaboration, and the ﬂ exibility of our people. 
We were able to operate continuously throughout the year, 
ensuring that investors had access to markets and could buy 
and sell without interruption. 
Market developments
The ETP ecosystem proved itself once again in 2020. 
Not only do ETPs offer investors transparent, competitively 
priced, and easy-to-access investment opportunities, 
but the ecosystem as a whole remained particularly robust 
in the face of extraordinary market circumstances. 
We maintained our position as the leading ETP liquidity 
provider across EMEA, our home market, where we are 
extremely well established. We continued to support the 
growing ﬁ xed income ETF market, and we enhanced our 
coverage of currencies, commodities and crypto trading. 
During 2020, Flow Traders became a top-3 market maker in 
spot metals on major FX ECNs.

From a technology perspective, we successfully launched 
a number of data programs, including in data analysis and 
creating a larger data lake, and enhanced our efﬁ ciency 
efforts through additional automation. This helped us 
decrease the average implementation time by 70%. 
In addition, we intensiﬁ ed our storage cost-efﬁ ciency by 
shifting to the cloud as a major storage front, and introduced 
even more rigorous cyber-security protocols as our people 
began home working. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to drive forward our existing 
growth strategy and will combine automation with data to 
help increase operational efﬁ ciency. We will also continue to 
invest in the stability and scalability of our platforms, while 
watching market developments closely. 
Financial overview
We had a record year with NTI of €933.4 million and 
demonstrated strong operational leverage with an EBITDA 
margin of 63% and EBITDA of €586.6 million. Ultimately, 
we recorded a Net Proﬁ t of €464.5 million with an EPS of 
€10.26. This, along with our strong capital position, allowed 
the company to make substantial capital returns to our 
shareholders with an interim FY20 dividend of €4 per share 
and ﬁ nal proposed dividend of €2.50.
Our response to COVID-19
We were able to provide uninterrupted liquidity and pricing 
to the ETP markets on a global basis during the pandemic. 
This involved activating our business continuity plan, aimed 
at ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and 
their families. Employees adapted extremely well to the 
changing working environment. We also hired selectively.
In the United States, we further solidiﬁ ed our regional 
position and grew the number of institutional counterparties 
we trade with. 
Our performance in the Asia-Paciﬁ c region strengthened as 
certain investments, such as those in Hong Kong, began to 
pay off. Structurally, we see growing adoption of request-
for-quote (RfQ) systems and a further shift towards 
electroniﬁ cation, which plays into Flow Traders’ core 
strengths.
Globally, we now trade with over 1,600 counterparties and 
provide liquidity in nearly 8,000 ETPs across around 180 
venues. 
Accelerating trends
The year’s events conﬁ rmed our strategic direction, as we 
operate on the edge of innovation, leading to an 
acceleration in technological and operational changes, 
unifying our efforts to implement new growth projects. 
As demonstrated in the fourth quarter, the investments we 
have made in growing our non-ETP market making activities 
are starting to pay off and are positively contributing to the 
top line.
Our global ETP footprint expanded to reﬂ ect the broader 
trends of the ETP ecosystem, such as the greater 
prominence of ﬁ xed income and ESG products. Our FX 
business now trades more than $5 billion daily through 
a growing number of platforms and institutional 
counterparties. We also expanded our ﬁ xed income 
structure in terms of interfaces and market data and 
increased market share across the board in ﬁ xed income 
ETFs.
“We believe we 
helped reassure the 
markets through our 
continuous presence, 
enabling investors and 
market participants 
to trade in all 
circumstances”

onboard new talent, and ﬁ nd ways to make people feel 
secure and fully integrated as they join the company. 
Naturally, we will provide investors with uninterrupted 
market access, and capitalize on the accelerating trend of 
automation / electroniﬁ cation and greater use of data, 
which developed swiftly in 2020. 
We will continue our growth strategy by expanding and 
deepening our global ETP footprint, as well enhancing 
trading in ﬁ xed income, currencies and crypto and there will 
be greater contributions from our non-ETP market making 
activities in 2021.
Finally, we want to thank our people for their adaptability, 
patience and hard work throughout the year. They are the 
engine that drives us forward. We would also like to 
recognize our shareholders and other stakeholders for their 
ongoing support and contribution.
Regards,
Dennis Dijkstra, Britta Achmann, Folkert Joling and 
Thomas Wolff.
We provided continuous liquidity and pricing, despite 
extraordinary and challenging market circumstances. 
We believe we helped reassure the markets through our 
continuous presence, enabling investors and market 
participants to trade in all circumstances.
Regulatory changes
The new European Union IFR/IFD regulations will come into 
force in June 2021. We concluded in 2020 that because the 
new regulations are more tailored to Flow Trader’s speciﬁ c 
risk proﬁ le, our capital requirements will be markedly lower. 
It is envisaged that this capital relief will be partially offset 
by growth in business activities.
New board member
At the beginning of the year our Management Board was 
strengthened with the addition of Britta Achmann as Chief 
Risk Ofﬁ cer, whose appointment was approved by 
shareholders in June. Despite joining shortly before the 
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Britta quickly 
integrated herself into the company. 
Britta’s initial impressions were on how robust the 
company’s risk management culture is, and how well we 
came through the COVID-19 crisis. Her primary focus area in 
2020 was on the operations team, which remains 
a signiﬁ cant growth area going forward.
Looking ahead
Our initial focus in 2021 will be on ensuring that our people 
remain safe and healthy. This will include maintaining home 
working for as long as necessary, and establishing safe 
travelling protocols when international travel resumes fully. 
At the same time, it’s important we continue to hire and

What we do
We are a ﬁ nancial technology company operating in the 
global ﬁ nancial markets, using our proprietary technology 
platform to provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices in 
thousands of ﬁ nancial products. Flow Traders ensures the 
provision of this liquidity to support the uninterrupted 
functioning of ﬁ nancial markets. Our core trading focus is on 
exchange-traded products (ETPs) and we do this globally, 
enabling investors to buy and sell ETPs efﬁ ciently by quoting 
bid and ask prices under virtually all market circumstances. 
Who we are
Flow Traders is a leading global ﬁ nancial technology-
enabled liquidity provider in ﬁ nancial products, historically 
specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), 
now expanding into other asset classes. Flow Traders 
ensures the provision of liquidity to support the 
uninterrupted functioning of ﬁ nancial markets. This allows 
investors to continue to buy or sell ETPs or other ﬁ nancial 
instruments under all market circumstances. 
We continuously grow our organization, ensuring that our 
trading desks in Europe, the Americas and Asia can provide 
liquidity across all major exchanges, globally, 24 hours a day. 
Founded in 2004, we continue to cultivate the 
entrepreneurial, innovative and team-oriented culture that 
has been with us since the beginning.
Our proﬁ le
We provide this liquidity via two main routes: “on screen” 
which is conducted on stock exchanges where Flow Traders 
is a registered market maker in ETPs and “off exchange” 
where we trade bilaterally with institutional counterparties, 
often through Request for Quote (RfQ) platforms such as 
those operated by Tradeweb and Bloomberg. More recently, 
we have commenced the diversiﬁ cation of our market 
making activities into other asset classes, such as Foreign 
Exchange (FX), commodities, cryptocurrencies and ﬁ xed 
income.

Products
Exchange-traded products (ETPs)
ETPs, the main products that we trade, are often compared 
to mutual funds largely because they are both baskets of 
shares, bonds, or commodities. However, that is where the 
similarity ends. Unlike most mutual funds, the majority of 
ETPs simply track an index without trying to outperform 
such indices. ETPs have open-ended fund structures rather 
than closed-end and, unlike mutual funds, can be 
continuously bought and sold on trading venues during 
trading hours and off-exchange at all times. 
ETPs provide investors with exposure to a wide variety of 
underlying assets, ranging from ETPs that replicate the 
composition of a particular equity index, to those that 
provide investors with exposure to assets in speciﬁ c sectors 
or countries, to commodities, or to currencies. ETPs also 
enable investors to create and manage diversiﬁ ed 
investment portfolios in an efﬁ cient manner, as well as 
enabling them to switch exposures at any given moment 
during trading days. There are broadly three main categories 
within ETPs in which we trade: 
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
This category is the most traded, when compared to ETCs 
and ETNs. ETFs derive their value from shares or bonds held 
in proportion to an index. For example, a Euro Stoxx 50 ETF 
would hold the same shares as the Euro Stoxx 50 index, 
in approximately the same proportions. Fixed-income ETFs 
derive their value from a portfolio of debt instruments. 
For example, bonds included in the Barclays US Treasury 1-3 
Year Term Index. ETFs are the most widespread among ETPs 
as measured by Assets under Management (AuM).

In this way, the issuance of ETPs through APs provides the 
issuers with access to a broad investor market without 
having to support a complex and costly trading 
infrastructure which would be non-core to their business. 
Redemption is the reverse of the creation process: the AP 
transfers ETPs to their issuer in exchange for the underlying 
assets (or a cash equivalent). The issuer then cancels the 
ETPs it received. This decreases the ETPs’ AuM. 
Secondary market
The secondary market is where ETP trading takes place 
between market participants, similar to the trading of 
ordinary shares, at market-determined prices. Secondary 
market participants include institutional and retail investors, 
liquidity providers and APs. Secondary markets include 
exchanges and other automated trading venues, as well as 
off-exchange trading between market participants such as 
large institutional investors.
Fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC)
Leveraging the scale and capabilities of our ETP proprietary 
technology-enable trading platform, Flow Traders has been 
able to also trade an increasing volume of the underlying 
asset classes in 2020 mainly in FICC.
Flow Traders started providing liquidity in FX as a separate 
asset class during 2018 and we have invested further in the 
business in order to drive growth in 2020. We provide 
liquidity in an increasing number of FX pairs on spot and 
futures in the EMEA and APAC markets to a fast-growing 
number of counterparties on an expanding number of 
platforms. In 2020, Flow Traders also became a top three 
market makers on major FX ECNs (Electronic 
Communications Networks) in spot metals.
The ETP ecosystem
The ETP ecosystem is made up of a number of participants 
who together make ETP investing and trading possible. 
These include investors, ETP issuers, exchanges and other 
trading venues and authorized participants, who can also act 
as liquidity providers, such as Flow Traders. The ETP 
ecosystem can be further divided into two markets: the 
primary market and the secondary market.
Primary market
Interaction in the primary market takes place between 
authorized participants (APs) and the issuers, who either 
issue or cancel ETPs. This is done in reaction to market 
demand and is called the creation and redemption process. 
APs can create ETPs with the issuer by transferring the 
underlying assets (or cash equivalent) to the issuer in return 
for a corresponding number of newly issued ETPs. 
This increases the ETPs’ Assets under Management (AuM). 
Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)
ETCs typically derive their value from a commodity index, 
such as the Bloomberg Commodity Index, although in some 
cases they derive it from just a single commodity, such as 
gold or oil, or a certain currency. For example, the SPDR 
Gold Shares ETC tracks the value of physical gold. ETCs may 
hold physical assets, but exposure can also be held through 
derivatives of the underlying commodity, in combination 
with cash.
Exchange-traded notes (ETNs)
ETNs are types of unsecured, unsubordinated debt 
securities issued by an underwriting bank. The returns of 
ETNs are based on the performance of the index being 
tracked. For example, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term 
Futures Index TR ETN would track the S&P 500 VIX 
Short-Term Futures volatility index.

this using pre-set hedging strategies, which, when possible, 
instantly reduce our market exposure, creating a market-
neutral position. 
Cutting edge proprietary technology 
platform
Developing software in-house 
As noted, we are a technology company operating in the 
ﬁ nancial industry. As such, technology lies at the heart of 
our business, enabling us to provide liquidity in a variety of 
market environments across the globe. We trade using 
proprietary and scalable software with the vast majority of 
our applications developed in-house. These include pricing 
and trading software, market data processing tools, 
pre-trade risk controls, and other risk and compliance tools. 
This is the main reason that our technology department 
makes up over 40 percent of our total staff and is our 
largest employee group.
One of our software platform’s core features is its modular 
design, which allows us to rapidly test and implement 
ongoing enhancements. This also means we can easily and 
cost-effectively expand our coverage of securities, asset 
classes, and geographical markets as we grow the business.
In 2020 our total technology expenses increased by 
16 percent versus 2019 as we invested further in the trading 
business. In 2020 our technology expenses represented 
40 percent of our total ﬁ xed expenses. In 2020, the number 
of technology FTEs grew to 221 from 204, in order to 
support the execution of our growth strategy.
Liquidity Provider
Leading liquidity provider
Flow Traders has two main roles in the ﬁ nancial ecosystem. 
The ﬁ rst is as a liquidity provider. In this role, we help 
maintain and improve the overall transparency and 
efﬁ ciency of the ecosystem, by quoting bid and ask prices 
for ﬁ nancial products like ETPs, FX and other products on 
trading venues, as well as off-exchange to institutional 
investors, which market participants can trade against. 
By providing liquidity we make it easier for investors to buy 
and sell ﬁ nancial products at a price that should reﬂ ect the 
(relation with the) current price of the underlying asset, 
and contribute to lower trading costs.
 
Another role we play in the ETP landscape is as an 
Authorized Participant (AP). We have AP-agreements in 
place with all the major ETP issuers. These agreements link 
the primary and the secondary ETP market and allow us to 
either create or redeem the ETPs and optimize our role as 
a leading liquidity provider in ETPs.
Pricing
Pricing ETPs accurately 
Being able to accurately price the ETPs that we provide 
liquidity in is vital to the success of our business. Get it 
wrong, and we risk not winning the trade or losing money 
due to bad prices. Our experience in establishing the pricing 
relationship between the ETPs and the underlying assets in 
a variety of market conditions means we can offer 
competitive bid and ask prices, while still covering our 
trading costs and locking in transaction proﬁ t. We achieve 
In commodities in general, Flow Traders has always been 
active in the ETP market as well as the underlying asset 
classes. Moreover, we hold physical storage as collateral 
with our prime brokers if physical delivery is demanded by 
counterparties.
In Fixed Income, 2020 saw continued ETP market growth. 
Flow Traders has a strong position in this market, particularly 
in EMEA and in the US. During 2020, we further optimized 
our trading proposition in Fixed Income ETPs by also 
deepening our access to, and trading, the associated 
underlying instruments.
Flow Traders also trades cryptocurrency, which we consider 
to be a key part of our FICC proposition, which is a small but 
growing part of our overall business. Flow Traders is the 
number one market maker in cryptocurrency ETPs being 
active on 15 exchanges globally, providing 24/7 liquidity. 
We are also a leading spot OTC liquidity provider. We have 
seen that there has been a continued adoption of this asset 
class by institutional investors with subsequent inﬂ ows in 
cryptocurrency ETPs and ETNs. 
Flow Traders expects that this diversiﬁ cation will lead to 
a larger contribution of underlying asset classes to the total 
value traded. It will also improve our ETP trading capabilities 
and improve our ability to grow NTI structurally. In 2020, 
there were positive NTI contributions from non-ETP trading 
activities as returns from investments in trading 
diversiﬁ cation became evident. Ultimately, Flow Traders’ 
goal is to become a one-stop shop liquidity platform in 
ﬁ nancial markets globally.

Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, 
may deem relevant. Our intentions in relation to dividends 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control.
The Management Board, subject to the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, may decide to make allocations to 
reserves and therefore decides how much of the proﬁ t will 
be allocated to reserves. The proﬁ ts remaining shall be at 
the disposal of the General Meeting. 
Reserves and dividend proposal for the ﬁ nancial 
year 2020
Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the company’s Articles of 
Association, the Management Board, with the approval of 
the Supervisory Board, has decided that of the proﬁ t for 
2020 (totaling €464.5 million), an amount of €172.2 million 
shall be added to the reserves. The remaining amount of 
€292.3 million is at the disposal of the General Meeting.
It is proposed to the General Meeting that a total cash 
dividend of €6.50 per share will be paid out to shareholders 
for the ﬁ nancial year 2020, subject to a 15 percent dividend 
withholding tax (dividendbelasting). An interim cash 
dividend of €4.00 per share was paid out on 21 August 2020. 
This means that the ﬁ nal cash dividend proposal to the 
General Meeting is €2.50 per share. Subject to approval by 
the General Meeting on 23 April 2021, shares will trade 
ex-dividend on 27 April 2021. Payment of the ﬁ nal dividend 
is anticipated to be made on 30 April 2021. Please also refer

Dividend policy and dividend proposal 
Dividend policy
Flow Traders intends to pay dividends annually in two 
instalments, with a target aggregate dividend pay-out ratio 
of at least 50 percent of the company’s net proﬁ ts realized 
during the ﬁ nancial year. The Management Board may 
decide, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, that the 
proﬁ ts realized during a ﬁ nancial year will fully or partially 
be appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. 
A distribution of (interim) dividends is subject to applicable 
rules and regulations, the Articles of Association of the 
company, the By-Laws of the Management Board, and the 
By-Laws of the Supervisory Board.
It is anticipated that our interim dividends will be declared 
and paid following the publication of our results for the ﬁ rst 
half of each year. However, there can be no assurance that in 
any given year a dividend will be proposed or declared.
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and 
timing thereof will depend on a number of factors, including 
legal and regulatory requirements, future proﬁ ts, ﬁ nancial 
conditions, general economic and business conditions, 
future prospects and such other factors as the Management

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Our strategy 
We will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing to grow 
our business and diversify into other asset classes. 
This should result in increasing our Net Trading Income (NTI), 
while maintaining our desired risk proﬁ le, controlling costs, 
and securing and attracting the right talent. Increasing our 
NTI involves increasing the product of volume and the net 
margin we capture per trade, where volume is the value of 
products we trade and the net margin is the margin we 
capture per trade after the corresponding exposure has 
been hedged. Our risk proﬁ le is characterized by having no 
directional opinion on the market. In other words, our results 
do not depend on the direction of market prices. 
By expanding our presence as a liquidity provider in both the 
ETPs and underlying asset classes, Flow Traders can 
maximize the growth of its NTI. 
By growing our presence in the global ﬁ nancial market as 
a liquidity provider, we build a foundation to support our 
long-term growth trend. By growing our presence in 
underlying asset classes, we expect to improve our 
performance in the future, including during those periods 
where the trading activity in the market may slow down. 
This is aligned with our ESG ambition and mission. Growing 
our presence in the ﬁ nancial markets through expanding 
and deepening our ETP trading footprint as well as 
improving pricing and access to ﬁ xed income, commodity 
and FX liquidity will only make markets more efﬁ cient and 
reduce trading costs for investors globally. It will also enable 
the ﬁ nancing of the shift towards a sustainable world 
economy. Moreover, in order to drive forward our growth 
Our ambition and strategy 
Our strategic ambition
Our ambition is to become a one-stop shop liquidity 
platform in ﬁ nancial markets globally.
Our market and environment
We operate in a highly dynamic world, which is characterized 
by mega trends such as globalization and technological 
development which only accelerates the pace of change. 
This only intensiﬁ es the competition in our markets, 
for example by through the increasing electroniﬁ cation of 
trading enabled by technology. Moreover, our markets are 
characterized by ever increasing regulation. This typically 
creates greater transparency and a more level playing ﬁ eld 
within our markets, which plays to our strength as 
a technology-enabled liquidity provider. Yet the markets’ 
core functions remains the same: transferring risk between 
various market participants. This is where we add value. 
Accordingly, our focus will continue to be on providing 
liquidity in more and more products in the ﬁ nancial markets 
with still a focus on ETPs.
Our business principles
Our business principles are being ﬂ exible, agile and focused 
on continuous improvements. To be successful, 
we recognize that we need to perform well across all areas 
of the business. Achieving this involves diligently studying 
the markets and our responses to them, and using our 
resources where they have the greatest impact. 
The outcome of this process deﬁ nes whether or not we have 
a competitive edge.
We create value in a number of ﬁ nancial and 
non-ﬁ nancial ways for a variety of stakeholders. 
Supported by our proprietary technology 
platform, we provide liquidity in ﬁ nancial 
products that helps contribute to more efﬁ cient 
markets by lowering overall trading costs, 
delivering greater execution quality and market 
transparency. For our employees, we provide a 
compelling and constantly evolving work 
environment that enables them to develop to 
their full potential. We take an active interest in 
the societies in which we operate, contributing to 
local learning initiatives and charities. And we 
care for our investors by focusing on growing 
proﬁ tably and providing dividend returns. 
Our value creation model shows how we create 
value and the impact our business has on our 
stakeholders.

AuM grew from €5,616 billion at the end of 2019 to €6,422 
billion by the end of 2020. This growth is expected to 
continue, as investors continue to invest in low-cost, 
transparent and easy-to-trade passive investment 
strategies. This contributes to the long-term value creation 
of Flow Traders’ strategy.
We believe there are a number of reasons for this trend to 
continue, including beyond 2021: one is that investors are 
attracted to the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables 
them to follow clearly how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid and 
available at low-cost and can be bought and sold easily 
during market hours. A third reason is that ETPs can be 
ETPs we buy or sell, and the prices we pay or receive for the 
underlying or related ﬁ nancial instruments to mitigate our 
risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager and do 
not have our own Assets under Management (AuM). We also 
do not develop or make products, do not provide any 
services and do not have (consumer) clients. Our value chain 
comprises, among others, of our institutional 
counterparties, prime brokers and regulators. 
The ETP market
The popularity of ETPs has continued to grow in recent 
years. According to asset manager BlackRock, global ETP 
agenda we rely on the talent and integrity of all colleagues 
at Flow Traders in line with our focus on business ethics and 
creating sustainable employment.
Markets and trends
Our business
In 2020 we had access to more than 180 trading venues in 
40 countries around the world. We provide liquidity in over 
7,900 ETP listings on- and off-exchange, which is around 
65 percent of all ETPs globally.
Off-exchange, we provide liquidity in ETPs on a request-
for-quote basis to more than 1,600 institutional 
counterparties across the globe, including banks, asset 
managers, pension funds, insurance companies, family 
ofﬁ ces, hedge funds, and others and this number is 
increasing on an almost daily basis. 
In addition to ETPs we provide liquidity in similar instruments 
whose value is correspondingly affected by a change in the 
value of underlying or related assets, such as futures or 
bonds. 
During 2020, we continued to implement our diversiﬁ cation 
initiatives into other asset classes and provided liquidity as 
a market maker including in FX, ﬁ xed income, commodities 
and cryptocurrency.
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider we 
generally do not have a directional opinion on the market. 
In other words, our results do not depend on the direction of 
market prices. Our NTI is realized through the small price 
differences that are realized between buying and selling 
related or correlating assets. Whether that is between the

as market makers. This investment underlines our long-term 
commitment to the US equities ecosystem as we seek to 
grow our business and presence further. 
The EMEA ETP market had a total ETP value traded of €2.0 
trillion in 2020. Our total ETP value traded from our Europe 
ofﬁ ces was €767.3 billion in 2020. We remained the number 
one liquidity provider in ETPs in EMEA and managed to grow 
our on- and off-exchange presence further. 
composed of ﬁ nancial instruments from almost any asset 
class, sector or location, providing investors access to 
markets that would normally be difﬁ cult to reach.
Review of 2020 
Global ETP markets grew by 14 percent in 2020 measured in 
AuM, driven again by the popularity of equity and ﬁ xed 
income ETPs. Annual global inﬂ ows of ETP AuM were €617 
billion in 2020 (2019: €499 billion – source BlackRock Global 
ETP Landscape December 2020). Overall trading activity in 
2020 increased signiﬁ cantly given elevated volatility levels 
as the markets reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Global coverage
Following Flow Traders’ recent expansion, we trade globally 
from ﬁ ve ofﬁ ces: in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, London, 
New York and Singapore. In addition, we announced the 
opening of a branch ofﬁ ce in Milan in November which is 
consistent with Flow Traders’ growth strategy to deepen its 
global footprint and it will enable Flow Traders to increase 
our proximity to institutional counterparties. In 2020, 
Flow Traders ETP value traded once again surpassed the €1 
trillion mark. The largest ETP market is still in the United 
States, where total ETP value traded (on-exchange and 
off-exchange) was €29.5 trillion in 2020. Our New York 
ofﬁ ce’s total ETP value traded was €671.8 billion in 2020, 
markedly higher than in 2019 and, for the third year in a row, 
a record year for Flow Traders US since inception. 
With institutional trading gaining further momentum in 
2020, Flow Traders US continued to grow and deepen its 
overall presence in this important market. In May, 
Flow Traders made a strategic investment in Members 
Exchange (MEMX). MEMX was founded in 2019 as a new US 
equities exchange and other members of the investor group 
include leading banks, retail brokers, asset managers as well 
In APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with large 
differences in trading volumes, trading costs, regulation and 
maturity across the ﬁ nancial markets. Volumes traded in the 
APAC region remained dominated by the top-10 most traded 
ETP products, as those 10 determine roughly 55 percent to 
65 percent of the total market volumes. The total ETP value 
traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) was €3.3 trillion in 
2020, including China, while the total ETP value traded at 
our APAC ofﬁ ces was €76.2 billion. Flow Traders had

In Asia we continue to increase our participation in the 
markets where we are already active, and expand into new 
markets. At the same time, we remain focused on markets 
that are potentially opening up, such as China, by capitalizing 
on our experience and increasing our business development 
capacities. We have also been increasing our footprint and 
visibility in the region, supporting our institutional trading 
and reafﬁ rming our role in the regional ETP ecosystem.
In general, we believe we can accelerate growth in all 
regions in the coming years, as the pace of electroniﬁ cation 
of trading intensiﬁ es across ﬁ nancial markets and we 
increasingly leverage on our technology and trading 
knowledge to progress the trading of other asset classes. 
In terms of the ongoing discussions on regulation, 
we continue to anticipate changes that further support 
a level playing ﬁ eld.
 
◾
long-term shifts driven by regulators looking to 
increase ﬁ nancial stability and transparency.
To take advantage of this expected growth, we aim to 
expand our presence further in all areas of ETP trading in all 
regions.
In Europe we have cemented our position as the leading 
liquidity provider by continuing to grow our presence on 
different venues and grow the number of counterparties. 
We have established a connection with virtually all ETP 
issuers active in Europe and we continued to grow our 
institutional counterparty-base substantially in 2020. MiFID 
II developments continued to have a beneﬁ cial impact on 
our counterparty base, as investors increased their focus on 
best execution, regardless of research access. With the 
expansion of our ofﬁ ces into London and Milan and the 
launch of liquidity provision in other asset classes, we have 
the building blocks in place to further increase our presence 
in Europe in 2021.
In the Americas, our ETP value traded continued to grow 
substantially in 2020, but remains relatively limited 
compared to the overall market size. We believe there is 
signiﬁ cant growth potential in Fixed Income ETFs, 
developed market equity ETFs and institutional trading. 
Institutional trading continued to gain mass in 2020 and is 
expected to grow further in 2021. We will continue to 
expand the number of products traded, the number of 
venues we trade on and the number of counterparties we 
are connected to in the US.
a successful year in 2020 in APAC in terms of trading 
volumes, conﬁ rming the contribution of speciﬁ c recent 
investments made in the region. A particular highlight in 
APAC in 2020 was the appointment by the HKEX of Flow 
Traders as the lead Tier 1 liquidity provider for the MSCI Asia 
and Emerging Market index futures and options suite.
ETP market remains high growth market
We still see signiﬁ cant opportunities for growth in the ETP 
market, driven by the widely expected expansion of this 
industry in the near future. This is due to a number of 
changes within the asset management industry, including: 
 
◾
the continuing shift to global electronic trading, which 
cuts costs and maximizes efﬁ ciency and transparency;
 
◾
a shift in asset growth from active strategies to more 
cost-effective, passive strategies;
 
◾
increasing ETP adoption globally among institutions, 
intermediaries and retail investors;

Our performance
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
ETP market experienced increased levels of 
market activity as well as heightened volatility 
throughout 2020. This was particularly evident in 
March and April with truly exceptional market 
circumstances in terms of ETP value traded and 
extremely elevated volatility levels. In 2020, our 
NTI of €933 million (2019: €216 million) reﬂ ected 
these market circumstances. 
Financial overview 
Net Trading Income
2020 saw signiﬁ cantly heightened levels of overall market 
activity compared to 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic spread 
globally. Volatility peaked in mid-March to early-April as the 
markets absorbed the potential impact of the pandemic 
with the VIX index reaching the 85 point mark in mid-March. 
Following these exceptional market circumstances, markets 
did proceed to normalize for the remainder of 2020, 
although the VIX index remained elevated compared to the 
levels seen in 2019. Given the impact of the pandemic, 
the global economy as well as the equity and bond markets 
received considerable support from governments and 
central banks. For example, the Federal Reserve System 
purchased ﬁ xed income ETPs throughout the course of 
2020.
Given this market backdrop and our leading global ETP 
trading footprint, Flow Traders total value traded in 2020 
grew to €5.2 trillion (2019: €4.0 trillion), of which €1.5 trillion 
(2019: €1.0 trillion) was traded in ETPs (on-exchange and 
off-exchange). The rest was traded in related ﬁ nancial 
products to facilitate competitive pricing in ETPs as well 
trading in other asset classes, such as FX. Meanwhile, 
ETP market value traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) 
also increased markedly during the same period to €34.9 
trillion (2019: €23.6 trillion).
The market environment experienced in 2020 along with 
Flow Traders’ own pricing, hedging and risk management 
capabilities translated into Net Trading Income (NTI) of €933 
million (2019: €216 million) - a record year for Flow Traders 
by some distance. We saw clear outperformance in all 
regions and across all asset classes as the levels of market 
activity were broad based in nature. Europe, our home 
market, contributed the most to our NTI which reﬂ ects that 
region’s high level of ﬂ ow visibility and counterparty and 
product coverage. There was also signiﬁ cant contributions 
from the US and APAC. During 2020, we were able to 
successfully leverage the recent investments made in the 
US and in ﬁ xed income.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, Flow Traders reported NTI of 
€130 million which reﬂ ected higher activity levels as 
markets reacted to the US elections and strategic 
reallocations by investors.
Market volatility
In 2020 market volatility increased markedly from the levels 
witnessed in 2019. The main volatility took place in March 
and April as the pandemic spread globally with average VIX 
levels of 58 and 42 respectively for those months. For the 
remainder of 2020, markets normalized although volatility 
levels remained above those seen in 2019.
Operational expenses
On the cost side, we maintained a ﬁ rm discipline on costs 
with ﬁ xed operating expenses amounting to €118.6 million in 
2020 (2019: €99.8 million), which is within the guided ﬁ xed 
cost growth rate of maximum 10 percent for 2020 
(excluding €11.4 million of one-off expenses). The main 
drivers of the increase in ﬁ xed expenses were technology 
investments to support diversiﬁ cation initiatives and

investors & counterparties which also includes prime 
brokers and the exchanges and (3) Communities. 
With regards to people, we successfully activated the 
business continuity plan with the primary focus being the 
health and well-being of our employees and their families. 
Employees have adapted well to the changing working 
environment. We have split teams and have activated 
back-up trading locations in Amsterdam, New York and 
Hong Kong. We have also continued to hire selectively and 
have paid all salaries without recourse to government 
support programs.
From an issuers, investors and counterparties perspective, 
we continuously provided liquidity and pricing despite some 
extraordinary and challenging market circumstances 
experienced at times during 2020. Indeed these market 
participants were reassured by our continuous presence 
when markets were under pressure which has enabled them 
to trade in all circumstances and when liquidity is most 
sought after. Market infrastructure, as well as our own, 
held up throughout this period and Flow Traders 
experienced no outages. Lastly, we committed to paying our 
FY19 and FY20 dividends.
In these unprecedented times, we feel that it is more 
important than ever to continue to contribute to society’s 
health and well-being globally. To continue giving to our 
communities, we established the Flow Traders Foundation in 
April 2020 and have put in place its initial funding which 
includes a €8.5 million of donation from Flow Traders. 
In addition, we have accelerated and increased employees’ 
annual charitable contributions which amounted to 
€2.5 million in 2020.
our shareholders, which represents a 63 percent dividend 
pay-out ratio.
As at 31 December 2020, our regulatory capital 
requirements under CRR were €218 million. As Flow Traders’ 
regulatory capital stood at €439 million, this resulted in an 
excess capital position of €220 million.
Growth
We continued to grow our team, strategies and 
infrastructure in 2020. We increased our institutional 
counterparty base globally to over 1,600 as well as being 
connected to over 180 trading venues. To facilitate this 
growth, we continued to grow the business during the year 
across all regions, resulting in an increase in the number of 
FTEs to 554 by year-end (2019: 513).
Our Response to COVID-19
First and foremost, Flow Traders has been able to 
continuously provide liquidity and pricing to the ETP markets 
on a global basis during the pandemic. Our overall response 
has focused on three main areas - (1) People (2) Issuers, 
efﬁ ciency improvements as well as new hires. 
FTEs increased by 8 percent to 554. There were also €11.4 
million of additional one-off expenses in 2020 relating to 
the continued activation of the business continuity plan 
(€3.0 million) as well as a €8.5 million of donations to the 
Flow Traders Foundation. Variable employee expenses have 
increased to €228.1 million (2019: €37.7 million) which 
reﬂ ects the improved overall ﬁ nancial performance of the 
business during the year. 
Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
demonstrated strong operational leverage with an EBITDA 
margin of 63% in 2020 (2019: 36%) and EBITDA of €586.6 
million (2019: €78.9 million).  
Capital base
During the year we continued to maintain a strong, stable 
capital base, comfortably exceeding both our regulatory 
and prime broker capital requirements. We paid out a €4.00 
interim dividend in August 2020 and propose to pay €2.50 as 
a ﬁ nal dividend over 2020. Over the course of 2020 we 
therefore aim to return a total of €6.50 through dividends to

Our ESG focus areas
 
◾
Business integrity
Being able to act with honesty and being consistent in 
whatever it is you are doing based on the particular 
moral value or belief compass you have. For Flow 
Traders this implies conducting business within 
a framework of laws and regulations, high ethical 
standards, respecting human rights and own policies 
and procedures. See page 29
 
◾
Liquidity in ﬁ nancial markets
Providing liquidity to global ﬁ nancial markets to 
promote fair, transparent and stable markets. 
Flow Traders ensures the provision of liquidity to 
support the uninterrupted functioning of ﬁ nancial 
markets. The provision of this liquidity allows investors 
to continue to buy or sell ETPs or other ﬁ nancial 
instruments under all market circumstances. 
See pages 29-30
 
◾
Good corporate governance
Pursuing the highest standards of good corporate 
governance to make sure we take actions that have 
a beneﬁ cial effect on all our stakeholders. Corporate 
governance is the system of rules, practices, 
and processes by which a ﬁ rm is directed and 
controlled and essentially involves balancing the 
interests of a company’s many stakeholders, such as 
shareholders, senior management executives, 
customers, suppliers, ﬁ nanciers, the government, 
and the community. See page 30
 
◾
Diversity and inclusion
Pursuing a diverse and inclusive business. Diversity is 
deﬁ ned as the range of human differences, including 
but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, gender 
identity, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical 
ability or attributes, religious or ethical values system, 
national origin, and political beliefs. Inclusion is deﬁ ned 
as involvement and empowerment, where the inherent 
worth and dignity of all people are recognized. For Flow 
Traders it implies being a truly equal opportunity 
employer, by recruiting, retaining and promoting people 
based on merit, and merit alone. See page 30
 
◾
Sustainable employment
Creating a context that contributes to sustainable 
employment, which refers to the extent to which 
workers are able and willing to remain working for Flow 
Traders. Flow Traders creates such a context by offering 
high-quality jobs, developing talent in-house, 
maintaining a substantial employee shareholder base, 
offering variable remuneration which allows employees 
to share in the success of Flow Traders and creating and 
maintaining high-quality jobs in the places where we 
conduct business. See pages 31-35
 
◾
Fair taxation
Pursuing the principle that tax should follow the 
business. Consequently Flow Traders pays taxes where 
proﬁ ts are earned in accordance with local tax 
legislation. We aim to comply with domestic and 
international tax laws and also the standards set by the 
OECD Guidelines. Flow Traders is aware that its 
business, including our approach to tax, has an impact 
on society. See pages 35-37
 
◾
Societal commitments and charities
Supporting charitable initiatives and engaging in 
community giving, not only ﬁ nancially but also by 
offering access to our knowledge and experience. 
A key part of this support will be through the Flow 
Traders Foundation which was established in 2020.
See page 37
 
◾
Stakeholder engagement
Engaging with stakeholders that may be affected by 
decisions and giving stakeholders the opportunity to 
inﬂ uence decision making processes through 
extensive stakeholder dialogue. See page 37
 
◾
Carbon emissions, material use and waste
Reducing the amount of carbon we emit through 
energy consumption and travel as well as reducing the 
amount of materials we use and waste at our ofﬁ ces 
which consists of stationary products and general 
household waste. Flow Traders does this e.g. 
by sourcing sustainably, video conferencing, buying 
green energy, limiting the amount of food wasted 
during lunches and separating waste. See page 38

Flow Traders ESG ambition is to ensure to smooth 
functioning of markets which will assist in ﬁ nancing the 
transition towards a sustainable society by:
 
◾
Investing in our trading capabilities to ensure that 
sustainable investment products can be traded easily 
and efﬁ ciently;
 
◾
Promoting the drive for fair and transparent markets, 
in continuous collaboration with the ﬁ nancial and 
investment community;
 
◾
Operating with high ethical standards at all times and 
compliance with laws and regulations and respecting 
human rights;
 
◾
Promoting sustainable tangible practices within our 
company and towards our communities, by respecting 
and developing our people and by supporting our 
ecosystem.
Stakeholder expectations and materiality 
analysis
As a ﬁ rst step towards the creation of our ESG strategy, 
we performed in late 2020, a materiality analysis to identify 
the ESG related issues that should be our main areas of 
focus. Based on internal and external developments we 
determined a shortlist of relevant topics. To determine the 
priority of the relevant topics we ﬁ rst launched 
a stakeholder consultation process to identify the ESG 
related issues that various stakeholders believe should be 
our main areas of focus, through a survey. Flow Traders has 
had the feedback from a wide selection of stakeholders, 
including shareholders, counterparties and issuers and 
employees. These stakeholders were selected because Flow 
Traders directly inﬂ uences their interests. Flow Traders’ 
stakeholders recognize that we play a role in ESG from 
Shared value
Flow Traders was founded more than 15 years ago, and in 
that time we have developed an innovative and 
entrepreneurial spirit that enables us to grow and explore 
new markets. We recognize that with this growth come 
responsibilities that go beyond our core business, and that 
our activities inﬂ uence the society in which we live and 
operate. 
At the same time, society has a very real impact on our 
business and operations. Both the Management Board and 
the Supervisory Board pay close attention to a wide variety 
of developments and trends that could pose either a risk or 
an opportunity and in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic as well 
as Brexit were such events. Another is the opportunity that 
comes with the shift to digitalization, which is helping make 
ﬁ nancial products and services more widely available to 
investors across society.
For us Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is about 
creating shared value. To better help manage our impact 
and our need to create shared value, we have divided our 
ESG focus across nine main focus areas. We have also 
connected these 9 ESG focus areas with three corresponding 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that 
we believe are particularly relevant for Flow Traders. 
Below we outline our priorities within each of these ESG 
focus areas, and explain our extended efforts to positively 
impact the world around us. At the end of this chapter we 
provide more information on our SDGs. 
Flow Traders ESG mission and ambition
The world is facing signiﬁ cant challenges in ensuring 
a sustainable future for our people and our planet. 
Many national and international initiatives are addressing 
these challenges. Every organization will have to play its 
own role in the transition to a sustainable society, depending 
on its impact and its opportunities.
The ﬁ nance sector can be an important contributor to the 
global sustainability agenda and can promote sustainable 
ﬁ nance, by incorporating environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) factors into investment decision-making, 
and by supporting the allocation of capital to sustainable 
initiatives.
Flow Traders has a critical and important role to play in the 
global ﬁ nancial ecosystem and ensures that ﬁ nancial 
markets function in an orderly manner. We serve the real 
economy by allowing investors, including pension funds and 
retail investors, to manage their risks by being able to trade 
at all times. Moreover, market makers such as ourselves, 
have made it much cheaper and more efﬁ cient to trade than 
in previous decades, which beneﬁ ts everyone. In this key 
role Flow Traders has a responsibility to contribute to the 
ﬁ nancial stability and the sustainable agenda in the 
countries in which we operates (see Flow Traders’ value 
creation model). As a key market participant, at the core of 
the ﬁ nancial ecosystem, Flow Traders will support the 
acceleration of the transition towards sustainable growth 
and ﬁ nance, notably by providing liquidity in the ever 
growing suite of ESG ETFs.

2. 
Liquidity in financial markets
As a liquidity provider we are active on global ﬁ nancial 
markets and we contribute to transparency in the pricing 
process, enabling market participants to invest at fair prices 
and lower costs. We enable thousands of exchange-traded 
products (ETPs) and other ﬁ nancial products to be traded 
across the world’s markets, by continuously quoting bid and 
ask prices. As an innovative segment of global ﬁ nancial 
markets, ETPs have introduced efﬁ ciencies and cut 
investment costs substantially for a wide range of investors, 
from pension funds to retail investors. Increased liquidity, 
higher execution quality, and lower overall trading costs are 
just some of the beneﬁ ts that liquidity providers, such as 
Flow Traders, offer through these innovative ﬁ nancial 
products compared to more traditional investment 
products. In 2020 we saw an increase in the amount of ESG 
ETFs and ETPs, including ESG products focused on clean/
alternative energy investments. As a leading liquidity 
provider in ETPs globally, Flow Traders naturally trades 
ESG-related products with its counterparties. For example, 
in 2020 we traded €17.3 billion off-exchange in more than 
400 different ESG and SRI ETPs.
Our role is to enable trading in widely diversiﬁ ed investment 
products to anyone at any time, allowing end-investors to 
invest with lower costs and thus produce potentially higher 
returns. As a result of the efforts of liquidity providers such 
as ourselves, over the years trading costs have dropped 
dramatically and access to transparent and inexpensive 
investment products for anyone has never been more open 
or efﬁ cient. This beneﬁ ts institutional investors, individual 
investors and, ultimately, society at large by creating a more 
open and accessible ﬁ nancial market.
Activities relating to ESG priorities
1. 
Business integrity
At Flow Trader, business integrity means conducting 
business within a framework of laws and regulations, to high 
ethical standards, and in accordance with our own policies 
and procedures. We also have a great respect for human 
rights in every jurisdiction where we operate. An example of 
our business integrity can be seen in the fact we have zero 
tolerance towards bribery and corruption and we actively 
ensure that no such behavior occurs. No cases of bribery or 
corruption were reported in 2020. Continuous training of 
staff as well as robust risk and compliance controls 
contribute to the business integrity of Flow Traders.
numerous standpoints: Flow Traders as a participant in the 
ﬁ nancial markets ecosystem, Flow Traders as a business 
providing services and as a corporate actor. In each of these 
roles, Flow Traders has different responsibilities. An internal 
consultation was held with internal management to 
prioritize the issues with which Flow Traders can have the 
most economic, environmental and societal impact. 
The outcomes of the stakeholder and management 
prioritization is presented in the materiality matrix below 
which was validated by both the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board and helped us determine our ESG 
priorities. On the basis of the materiality matrix Flow Traders 
has identiﬁ ed 9 key issues, of which ﬁ ve are considered 
highly material.

We are committed to being a truly equal opportunity 
employer, by recruiting, retaining and promoting people 
based on merit, and merit alone. This also holds for our 
Management Board and we were delighted to welcome 
Britta Achmann as Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer and member of the 
Management Board in 2020. For any future Management 
Board and Supervisory Board appointments, due regard will 
of course be made towards our Equal Opportunities Policy.
We also believe in open communication and encourage 
collaboration across the company. Everyone within the 
company has unrestricted, direct access to senior 
management and are regularly informed and consulted 
about key developments. People are encouraged to speak 
their minds to help make Flow Traders a better place to 
work. Information travels freely and is not restricted unless 
we need to protect overriding interests, such as those 
concerning regulations, commercial sensitivities or to 
protect our intellectual property.
We are a sponsor of Women in ETFs and have co-organized 
inspirational women events for the Amsterdam Chapter of 
Women in ETFs. 
5. 
Sustainable employment
Since the day we were founded, our goal has been to foster 
a culture that encourages innovation, entrepreneurialism 
and risk-awareness, while focusing on drive, teamwork and 
ownership. By developing talent in-house and maintaining 
a committed and substantial employee shareholder base, 
we have strengthened internal bonds and helped create 
a loyal, forward-looking team. We are proud that we create 
and maintain high-quality jobs, which result in a stable and 
trusting working environment that beneﬁ ts our people, 
Flow Traders remains focused on long-term value creation, 
culture and risk management while balancing the interests 
of our many stakeholders, such as shareholders, senior 
management executives, counterparties, suppliers, 
investors, employees, regulators and the community. 
When making decisions, both boards carefully weighs the 
interest of all these stakeholders in relation to our company 
objectives and ESG priorities. Please refer to the chapter 
‘Governance’ for further information.
4. 
Diversity and inclusion
Flow Traders is a multinational company with ofﬁ ces across 
the globe. This naturally creates an environment where 
people of diverse cultures and backgrounds collaborate and 
drive our organization forward, excel every day, and perform 
at the highest level possible. We believe that a diverse 
workforce, which has open communication channels and the 
freedom to collaborate and introduce best practices, helps 
create a richer variety of ideas and can better develop 
solutions to the challenges we face. 
We have a long-standing policy of recruiting and retaining 
the best talent available and aim to provide an inclusive 
working environment regardless of the gender, ethnicity, 
faith or sexual orientation of our employees. We are 
committed to providing equal employment opportunities to 
all qualiﬁ ed job applicants. As a result, we employ people 
from 53 nationalities across our ofﬁ ces. The composition of 
our workforce tracks the outﬂ ow of the education system in 
the various roles we offer. We strongly encourage women to 
apply for any function within the ﬁ rm, particularly when they 
have a background in ﬁ elds that traditionally have a higher 
proportion of male employees. This is supported by our 
Equal Opportunity Policy (please refer to the chapter Our 
governance for further information). 
This role was never more important than during the 
exceptional and extraordinary market circumstances 
evident in late March and early April when Flow Traders was 
able to continuously provide liquidity and pricing to the ETP 
markets on a global basis. End-investors, issuers and 
counterparties have been reassured by our continuous 
presence when markets were under pressure which has 
enabled them to trade in all circumstances and when 
liquidity is most sought after.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager and do 
not have our own Assets under Management (AuM). We also 
do not develop or make products, do not provide any 
services and do not have (consumer) clients. Our value chain 
comprises, among others, of our institutional 
counterparties, prime brokers and regulators.
3. 
Good corporate governance
We operate a two-tier governance structure, consisting of 
a Management Board and a Supervisory Board. 
The Management Board is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the company, formulating strategies and 
policies, and setting and achieving our objectives. 
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the 
Management Board. Each board is accountable to the 
General Meeting for the performance of its duties.
Our governance is reﬂ ected in our internal rules and 
regulations, including our Articles of Association, 
Management Board By-Laws, Supervisory Board By-Laws, 
the Terms of Reference of our Supervisory Board 
committees and our Code of Conduct. These, together with 
our policies, can be found on our website.

tournaments in Amsterdam, Australia and New York, chess 
tournaments in Amsterdam, and trading competitions in 
select universities in Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong 
and Singapore.
As a technology enabled ﬁ rm, we facilitate opportunities for 
young talent in technology. In 2020 we continued to invest 
in the Graduate Software Development program, which will 
enhance the experience of new graduates joining the 
company in 2021. The program was designed for ambitious, 
skilled and creative graduates who like to be challenged 
every day and who strive to make visible contributions to the 
further growth of our business. Successful applicants join 
the company’s development teams for one year to work on 
a variety of projects. One of the goals is to improve the 
proprietary technology platform that enables Flow Traders 
to trade on exchanges worldwide. The projects cover 
multiple areas of our technology landscape. After 
completing their project, participants present their results to 
a jury, led by the Global Head of Technology. Throughout the 
program, graduates receive continuous support from 
dedicated mentors, not only in the ﬁ eld of technology, 
but also in the area of personal development.
Graduate Software Developers are typically recruited 
straight from university, having Computer Science or 
Engineering-related educational backgrounds. All graduates 
share a strong interest in either C++ or Java, which is why 
a coding test is an important part of the selection procedure. 
To experience development at Flow Traders ﬁ rst hand, 
we invite an exclusive group of students to our technology 
event CODE@FLOW in our Amsterdam ofﬁ ce. The two-day 
challenge gives participants an opportunity to engage in 
high-tech discussions and technical cases with our 
our business, and society. This is reﬂ ected in a low 
absenteeism rate of 0.90% globally seen in 2020.
Our ofﬁ ces are all growing, and we look to hire as many 
qualiﬁ ed applicants as we can ﬁ nd. However, our selection 
standards remain high – our candidates need to go through 
a number of tests and interviews, with less than 1 percent of 
applicants for trading positions ultimately receiving a job 
offer. To ﬁ nd people with the unique skill sets needed for 
a global liquidity provider we recruit across the globe, 
advertising and searching across multiple platforms. 
We also visit campuses in India, Hong Kong, Australia, 
Singapore, the US, and across Europe, meeting talents in 
career fairs and workshops. This year, due to the pandemic 
and the resulting restraints, we have moved the bulk of our 
recruitment efforts online. We still recruit for all disciplines 
and look for the best caliber available, regardless of their 
gender, age, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. To take an 
unbiased decision, in our recruitment process for certain 
events, certain data, including names and gender, is blacked 
out.
Graduate traders are typically recruited straight from 
university. Although our traders have a varied educational 
background, they share a strong numerical aptitude, which is 
why a numerical test is an important part of the selection 
procedure. To experience the world of trading ﬁ rst hand, 
we invite a select group of students to our Business Courses 
in our Amsterdam and New York ofﬁ ces. The two-day event 
is packed with interesting and challenging trading exercises 
and simulations and includes quantitative and technical 
cases to mirror the evolving nature of the role. In a similar 
fashion, we host the Flow Traders Arbitrage Challenge case 
competition in Singapore and Hong Kong. We also host 
numerous informal events such as the annual poker 
“ To continue giving 
to our communities 
in a more structured 
manner, in April 
2020 we established 
the Flow Traders 
Foundation”

We are a fast growing company, which creates good jobs 
across a variety of departments. In 2020 we welcomed over 
138 new hires, resulting in a 8 percent increase in the number 
of employees year-on-year. Our new colleagues join us from 
all parts of the world. To make sure they feel at home 
quickly we offer full relocation support for everyone moving 
to our ofﬁ ces from abroad. We help with ﬁ nding a home, 
applying for a visa and getting to know the local culture. 
We also offer our international employees based in 
Amsterdam the opportunity to attend Dutch language 
classes. This year speciﬁ cally, we had to onboard a large part 
of our new hires online, as we were limiting presence in the 
ofﬁ ces by having the majority of our staff working from 
home for a prolonged period of time, to help reduce the 
spread of COVID-19.
specialists in software development and trading, followed 
by a competitive hackathon.
In 2020 we continued hosting, participating in, 
and sponsoring a variety of events, ranging from in-house 
days to a special event for women who are curious about 
a career in the trading industry to various meet ups. With the 
opening of our new London branch in 2018, we have 
structurally increased our presence at the relevant 
universities in the UK and held multiple recruitment 
campaigns. 
All our ofﬁ ces are designed to provide a pleasant and 
ergonomically sound place to work. They are ﬂ ooded with 
light, have attractive, well laid out interiors and 
ergonomically-optimized furniture. In addition, to give our 
people the opportunity to perform at their best, we offer 
healthy breakfast and lunch options, have our own bar in 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong, New York and Singapore, 
and organize great company trips and parties. 
In Amsterdam, we also have our own in-house gym facilities 
and an in-house barber in New York. We not only use our 
newly-designed bars for after work gatherings, but also for 
recruiting events and quarterly staff updates. We believe 
these beneﬁ ts are important to maintain a healthy and 
happy workforce and to stimulate bonding and connections 
beyond employees’ direct circle of colleagues, helping to 
encourage teamwork across the whole company. This year, 
these workplace related beneﬁ ts could not be enjoyed to 
the fullest as a large portion of our staff was working from 
home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, 
we invested in people’s home ofﬁ ce environments by 
granting a budget for buying equipment and offering other 
support measures to staff.

expanded the available offerings, with mainly online training 
session formats. 
Many of our managers are ‘home-grown’, having developed 
into their positions after a number of years working with the 
company. They set an example and act as an inspiration for 
new hires, illustrating the career paths open to them. And to 
complement self-growth, we also like to give our employees 
the chance to transfer between our ofﬁ ces and experience 
life and work elsewhere. 
We believe in sharing our proﬁ ts with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and ofﬁ ce are 
entitled to receive variable compensation relative to their 
contribution to the ﬁ rm as a whole. We are transparent 
about how we pay our people and how much we pay them, 
including management. We have a Remuneration Policy that 
permits variable pay only when a proﬁ t is made. We are 
constantly looking for ways to improve our remuneration 
We invest in our people. For example, we provide them with 
a range of excellent training programs, beneﬁ tting them and 
the company. 
Our new hires in trading and technology start with an 
intensive introduction program, bringing them up to speed 
with our way of working and training them in the speciﬁ c 
skills they need to do their job well. All junior traders – 
including those hired for our Asian and the US ofﬁ ces – begin 
their global training program at our ofﬁ ces in Amsterdam. 
And all new employees receive an introduction to Flow 
Traders through the Flow Academy, including online and 
on-site training that provides programs in a wide variety of 
subjects, including culture, technology, regulatory 
developments, trading for non-traders, and the 
Whistleblower Policy, including anti-corruption. Through 
Flow Academy we offer everyone varied training 
opportunities, aimed at improving function-speciﬁ c skills or 
for their own personal development. In 2020, we further

Fair taxation
We are committed to being good corporate citizens, bringing 
positive value to the communities we operate in. We pay 
taxes where they are due and subscribe to fair taxation in 
terms of corporate income tax. We note that taxes are not 
limited to corporate income tax but also include VAT, wages 
tax, social securities, dividend withholding tax, stamp duties 
and other transaction taxes. In 2020 we incurred total 
corporate income taxes of €107 million (2019: €12 million) 
which was 19% of our taxable income. We believe it is vital to 
operate a fair, transparent and straightforward tax policy, 
which is required when running a sustainable business and 
delivering long-term value to all our stakeholders. 
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of its 
ﬁ nancial reporting and its relations with tax authorities 
globally. With regard to ﬁ nancial reporting, conservative 
accounting principles are being applied and one-offs must

principles. And because variable remuneration is, to a large 
extent, deferred, it remains at risk of forfeiture if we sustain 
a loss. We believe this is the strongest incentive for 
sustainable, risk-aware behavior for all our staff. In addition, 
we promote employee shareholding through rewarding 
a signiﬁ cant part of variable remuneration in shares. 
This aligns the interests of the company with those of our 
employees by creating ‘skin in the game’. 
Shares held by employees and 
Management Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, thus aligning 
the company’s long-term success to their personal ﬁ nancial 
circumstances. Since IPO , we have utilized a number of 
share schemes. Around the time of the IPO, our CEO and 
a signiﬁ cant number of current and former employees 
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow Traders 
Cash Incentive Plan (FC IP) and Flow Traders Loyalty 
Incentive Plan (FL IP) were introduced for employees (not 
the Management Board). The FC IP was replaced in 2020 by 
a new share plan for employees which provides the award up 
to 50% of variable remuneration in shares (or share-like 
instruments). 
On 31 December 2020, out of 564 employees, 429 
employees are active participants of various employee share 
plans.
In 2015 a group of employees bought shares in Flow Traders. 
These shares are subject to a six-year lock-up period. 
25 percent of these shares have been released on 1 June 
2018, 1 June 2019 and 1 June 2020. The last 25 percent of the 
shares will be released on 1 June 2021.

occur infrequently and be clearly documented. In the 
current rapid changing tax landscape and the associated 
various (new) tax reporting requirements, Flow Traders as 
a technology enabled liquidity provider strives to automate 
tax ﬁ ling processes as much as possible. Flow Traders is 
a strong believer that by automating tax processes it 
improves the compliance quality and the insight of the 
company’s tax position.
The dialogue we have with stakeholders includes discussions 
on our ﬁ nancial reporting and tax policy and, as with all 
stakeholder input, is considered during our decision-making 
process. However, so far we have not seen a desire among 
stakeholders for a change to our tax policy. We support 
transparency initiatives, such as country-by-country 
reporting and Base Erosion and Proﬁ t Shifting from the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD), and frequently assess the impact of such initiatives. 
We also closely monitor the reporting thresholds under the 
country-by-country reporting rules, to ensure that we meet 
our reporting obligations when we fall under the scope of 
this rule. Where necessary or relevant, we take the 
appropriate actions to adopt these initiatives in our tax 
control framework. Further details on our tax policy can be 
found under Tax Principles on our website. The tax principles 
also serve as KPIs throughout our performance 
measurement. The tax function within the company will 
therefore provide appropriate input as part of the approval 
process for business proposals to ensure a clear 
understanding of the tax consequences. 
We have good standing relationships with the tax authorities 
in each region in which we operate. We proactively manage 
our relationship with the tax authorities with the aim of

minimizing the risk of challenge, dispute or damage that 
could have an impact on our credibility. We concluded 
a horizontal supervision agreement with the Dutch Tax 
Authority (horizontaal toezicht) with a view to further 
strengthening our transparent and professional relationship 
with the tax authorities. Tax laws, rules and interpretations 
are continuously subject to a changing social view towards 
tax and we cannot be certain of continued beneﬁ t from 
certain tax regimes, such as the FSI Schemes in Singapore 
and innovation box regime in the Netherlands. Given the 
complexity of the continuously changing tax legislation, 
and the fact that this may create uncertainty for Flow 
Traders, we obtain independent external tax advice through 
reputable tax ﬁ rms or, when appropriate, approval is 
obtained from tax authorities on speciﬁ c material or 
complex tax matters.
The key participants in the Tax Control Framework are well 
established and include the Supervisory Board, 
Management Board, Finance department, Tax department, 
internal auditors and external auditors. They are able to 
assess and weigh the risks associated with the tax decision 
process for our business and stakeholders. Under Flow 
Traders Tax Control Framework, signiﬁ cant tax positions, 
including the tax strategy, are always shared with and 
subject to the approval of the Management Board. 
Flow Traders pays taxes where proﬁ ts are earned in 
accordance with local tax legislation. We do not use tax 
haven jurisdictions for tax avoidance purposes and carry out 
our business through entities in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the company can operate its business in 
line with its belief that it is part of the corporate social

Stakeholder engagement
We enter the public dialogue with full transparency whether 
that is with shareholders, investors, regulators or any other 
body that has an interest in our company.
Our contributions to the regulatory dialogue are typically 
made public and we are always willing to discuss what we do, 
and how that impacts the world around us. We have 
extensive dialogue with interest groups, including those 
focusing on transparency, institutional and retail 
shareholder interests, academia and students, local 
governments, regulators and anyone else who has an 
interest in what we do, and how we do it. We commit to being 
approachable and fully transparent with the goal to promote 
fairness, transparency and the orderly functioning of the 
ﬁ nancial markets.
Management engages with shareholders and prospective 
investors throughout the year and had 194 such meetings in 
2020 either one-on-one or at a conference. Notably, 
the Supervisory Board also engaged with shareholders, 
proxy agencies and governance bodies in 2020 regarding the 
remuneration policy for the Management Board, ESG and 
corporate governance developments. This stakeholder 
dialogue helps to shape Flow Traders’ strategy as well as 
signiﬁ cant corporate governance topics.
charity for a €50 donation to be made. Ultimately, 
210 selections were made and donations were made to 
charities including The Ocean Cleanup, Free a girl, 
Flow Traders Foundation, the International Red Cross and 
Caritas.
To continue giving to our communities in a more structured 
manner, in 2020 we established the Flow Traders Foundation 
(the Foundation), and Sjoerd Rietberg, former Co-CEO of 
Flow Traders, has agreed to serve as the ﬁ rst chairman of 
the board of the Foundation. The other members of the 
board comprise Flow Traders’ two founders, Jan van Kuijk 
(treasurer) and Roger Hodenius (secretary). Flow Traders 
itself donated €8.5 million to the Foundation in 2020. 
In addition, Flow Traders’ two founders as well as members 
of the Management Board, employees and former 
employees have committed to provide further funding of 
€2.5 million personally. 
This funding allowed the Foundation to commence fulﬁ lling 
its aim of promoting and funding health and well-being 
charities globally. At the Flow Traders Foundation, there will 
be a pursuit of making things better by tackling problems 
through supporting highly transparent and cost-effective 
causes that improve people’s lives. The ﬁ rst focus of the 
Foundation will be the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal 1 - No Poverty. 
Some of the charitable organizations already supported by 
the Foundation from the Amsterdam ofﬁ ce include:
 
◾
Emergency Support for Moria (UNHCR)
 
◾
Clothing store for less fortunate people - Kledingbank 
Zaanstad
 
◾
Care Farm - Stichting Van Ravenswaaijstede

responsibility duty to pay taxes where it operates. In addition 
to corporate income taxes, Flow Traders pays many other 
taxes, including but not limited to, payroll taxes and social 
security contributions on the wages of its employees, value 
added taxes and property taxes. All these taxes are 
a signiﬁ cant basis of funding governmental public services. 
It is our social responsibility to contribute through taxes in 
the regions we operate in. For more information on our tax 
position, please refer to note 11 of the ﬁ nancial statements.

Societal commitments and charities
At Flow Traders, we believe it is important for us to back 
initiatives that contribute to society. We’ve done so for many 
years – through the ﬁ rm and through our colleagues’ 
personal efforts. We support a number of charities, not only 
ﬁ nancially but also by offering access to our knowledge and 
experience. Our people are enthusiastic about supporting 
charitable initiatives, which has always been part of our 
working culture. We do this by supporting Flow Traders 
employees in fundraising activities by giving time or access 
to our network.
In the extraordinary times experienced for most of 2020, 
we feel it is more important than ever to look for additional 
ways to contribute to society. We have also accelerated and 
increased the annual charitable contributions made by 
employees, with €2.5 million donated to a select number of 
charitable organizations worldwide at the onset of the 
pandemic - including Erasmus MC, Vereniging van 
Voedselbanken Nederland, VentilatorPAL, The Courage 
Fund, The Community Chest and Mount Sinai Health System.

Flow Traders’ primary GHG emissions arise from energy use 
in its ofﬁ ces and data centers, from staff travel, 
and indirectly from its supply chain (Scope 3). Flow Traders 
has a direct grasp only on Scope 1 and 2, which represent 
only 66% of the complete GHG emissions. For scope 3, 
we will need to initiate a dialogue with our entire value chain 
(upstream and downstream) to act on the bulk of these 
emissions.
In addition, for several years, Flow Traders has taken care to 
reduce its consumption of paper and water in its ofﬁ ces and 
data centers as well as reduce its waste to minimize its 
ecological footprint. We have stopped using single-use 
water bottles and provided employees with reusable water 
bottles. This has limited the plastic waste within the 
company signiﬁ cantly. When refurbishing our ofﬁ ces, 
we sought to use more environmentally friendly solutions 
for lighting and water consumption. We also offer a full 
lunch to all our employees, healthy and free of charge. 
We work to limit our food waste as much as possible by 
responsible purchasing of ingredients and making sure 
leftovers are consumed the next day.
Our culture and values
We have always believed that creating a strong and 
successful business requires a set of shared values that 
everyone can rally around. Values that help shape how 
everyone behaves, feels and develops at work. We live by 
our values every day - they are at the core of what we do:
 
◾
We make investing cheaper, fairer and more efﬁ cient 
for end-investors
 
◾
We support markets with liquidity provision under all 
circumstances
Flow Traders reports its scope 1 & 2 emissions via the 
operational control approach. Scope 2 represents 
market-based emissions from electricity. For more 
information, please refer to our Carbon footprint report, 
which can be requested from Investor Relations. 
Flow Traders’ carbon footprint is equivalent to 960.0 tons 
CO2eq that may be split as following:
 
◾
scope 1 = 55.5 tons CO2eq representing 6% 
 
◾
of Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint, which are 
direct emissions from buildings;
 
◾
scope 2 = 577.2 tons CO2eq representing 60% 
 
◾
of Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint, which 
comprises electricity consumption from buildings;
 
◾
scope 3 = 327.3 tons CO2eq representing 34% of 
Flow Traders’ global carbon footprint, which is currently 
calculated through business ﬂ ights and the use of 
servers.

Carbon emissions, material use and waste
Flow Traders considers its overall direct impact on the 
environment to be low. Due to the nature of our business, 
Flow Traders has a relatively light carbon footprint. 
We promote public transport use by having conveniently 
located ofﬁ ces and by not offering lease cars. Where 
possible we use video-conferencing to limit travel. 
Nevertheless, conscious of the challenges linked to climate 
change, the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
to manage natural resources prudently and sparingly, 
Flow Traders has sought to integrate environmental issues 
into its activities and strategy. In this context, Flow Traders 
has carried out an analysis of its carbon footprint in 2020 for 
the ﬁ rst time. As a result, this report contains signiﬁ cantly 
more data than our earlier reports. This footprint will serve 
as the baseline. Flow Traders will focus in the coming years 
on reducing its carbon footprint, and will deﬁ ne clear targets 
in the course of 2021. In the meantime, during 2020 Flow 
Traders became carbon neutral, committing to offsetting 
our entire carbon footprint. By measuring, mitigating and 
offsetting our remaining carbon footprint, we aim to do our 
part in tackling global climate change, while supporting 
sustainable development in local communities.

sneakers are common. We believe that what someone says

contributions of our team-members are crucial to the 
success of the company. We believe that two people know 
more than one, and that people can have great ideas even in 
areas different to their core expertise. Which is why we 
welcome and encourage everyone to share their opinions. 
Anyone with a good idea, in their own area of expertise or 
another, is encouraged to share. This is part of the open, 
informal and diverse culture that makes us who we truly are.
Nurturing our culture
Maintaining, preserving and nurturing our culture is 
extremely important to everyone across the organization. 
This is done by the Management Board through the 
organization of ﬁ rm-wide events and company outings as 
well regular all-staff updates. Colleagues themselves also 
reinforce the strength of our culture by organizing their own 
events, competitions and charitable endeavors.

Two examples which are worth highlighting:
 
◾
Various colleagues gave up their valuable spare time to 
assist with the establishment and implementation of 
the Flow Traders Foundation as well as its ongoing 
operation.
 
◾
Core group of trading staff camped in the main 
Amsterdam ofﬁ ce for a short period at the onset of the 
extraordinary market conditions in late March to 
maintain the Remunerate provision of liquidity to the 
markets. This ensured that a bio-secure environment 
was created while the business continuity plan was fully 
activated.
Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations (UN) has identiﬁ ed 17 SDGs that are 
designed to help bring peace and prosperity for people and 
the planet as we work collectively towards the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development. In 2020 we performed 
a materiality analysis to identify our ESG priorities. Based on 
these ESG priorities we analyzed the SDGs on subtarget 
level, to identify the three SDGs we (can) have an impact on. 
In 2021 we will be developing our ESG strategy to steer 
towards more positive impact on these SDGs.

building better futures for forcibly 
displaced communities. We work to 
ensure that everybody has the right 
to ﬁ nd safe refuge, having ﬂ ed 
violence, persecution, or war at 
home.
The ofﬁ ce of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was 
created in 1950, during the aftermath of 
the Second World War, to help millions of 
Europeans who had ﬂ ed or lost their 
homes. We had three years to complete 
our work and then disband. 
Today, over 70 years later, our organization 
is still hard at work, protecting and 
assisting refugees around the world. 
More than 79.5 million individuals are 
forcibly displaced worldwide. Children 
below 18 years of age constitute a little less 
than half of the refugee population. We are 
facing multiple crises on multiple 
continents and are providing vital 
assistance to refugees, asylum-seekers, 
internally displaced and stateless people, 
many of whom have nobody left to turn to.
UNHCR works hard to protect and assist 
refugees with lifesaving support, but our 
ultimate goal is to ﬁ nd lasting solutions 
that allow them to rebuild their lives. 
As refugee situations are becoming more 
and more protracted and complex, 
creating sustainable solutions to empower 
refugees such as through education and 
livelihood are key.

UNHCR partners with governments and the 
private sector to ensure quality education 
for more refugee children and young 
people from host communities globally. 
Our education programmes improve the 
quality of teaching and learning and ensure 
safe learning environments for children. 
We also promote awareness and advocacy 
on the importance of education and 
strengthen capacity and partnerships with 
ministries of education and others to 
enable more refugee children to attend 
school.
Support from the private sector is of vital 
importance to UNHCR’s mission to support 
people forced to ﬂ ee globally. Companies, 
foundations, and individuals help maximize 
our impact and improve our capacity to 
truly make a difference for refugees 
worldwide.

Rebuilding lives of refugees 
through education
Sustainable Development Goal 4 aims to 
deliver “inclusive and quality education for 
all and to promote lifelong learning”. 
Of the 20.4 million refugees under 
UNHCR’s care, 8.1 million are of school age. 
Their access to education is limited, with 
3.9 million unable to attend school. 
Education is a basic human right and helps 
refugee children to rebuild their lives after 
being forced to ﬂ ee their home. It protects 
refugee children and youth from forced 
recruitment into armed groups, child 
labour, sexual exploitation, and child 
marriage. Education also empowers 
refugees, as it gives them the knowledge 
and skills to live productive, fulﬁ lling, and 
independent lives. Education enacts 
long-lasting change, as it paves the way for 
employment, builds self-reliance and 
alleviates refugees from poverty for life.

The available capital in the trading companies is monitored 
on a daily basis to ensure that requirements are met at all 
times and sufﬁ cient capital is available to support the 
Group’s strategy.
Capital requirements
The Group needs to comply with capital requirements from 
its prime brokers, as well as regulatory capital requirements. 
Capital is being managed by the Group in order to maintain 
net liquidity (which represents the value of our trading 
positions, principally long and short positions in equity 
securities, plus cash and cash equivalents) in excess of our 
various capital requirements at all times, while 
simultaneously exceed the regulatory capital requirements.
Prime broker capital requirements
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain certain 
minimum capital levels. Prime brokers use various internal 
systems to calculate required capital amounts (e.g., the 
‘internal haircut model’ and the ‘margin based approach 
model’, both intending to ensure sufﬁ cient levels of risk 
allowances) and have different limits structure, pre-funding 
possibilities and cut-off times for wiring capital. 
The aggregate capital that the prime brokers require is 
signiﬁ cantly higher than their risk exposure. For example, 
we may clear two legs of one transaction through two 
different prime brokers. Even when the transaction is fully 
hedged (the risk is fully offset), each prime broker will still 
require capital for such position as if the risk is not being 
offset. The prime brokers cannot establish that the other 
prime broker has an offsetting position so they will charge 
a full capital requirement. This increases the capital they 
require us to maintain beyond what would be necessary. 
In addition, margin requirements of prime brokers are 
conclusions, the Group’s ﬁ nancial position as at 31 December 
2020 and the strong free cash ﬂ ow of the Group, the Group’s 
ability to access capital markets and the principal risks 
facing the Group are taken into consideration. 
A commentary on the Group’s cash ﬂ ows, ﬁ nancial position 
and liquidity for the year ended 31 December 2020 is set out 
on pages 104 to 144. The Group’s capital position is strong 
and therefore the Management Board believes that Flow

Capital management
The Management Board’s policy is to maintain a strong 
capital base well above the required margins in order to 
maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁ dence and to 
sustain future development of the business. 
The Management Board monitors the return on capital as 
well as the level of dividends to shareholders while 
complying with prime broker and regulatory capital 
requirements.
Outlook
Our aim is to continue to look for ways to strengthen our 
ESG focus and associated disclosure. With this in mind, 
we will seek to develop a full ESG and sustainability strategy. 
This will include alignment with GRI as well as setting targets 
and associated KPIs. We will also develop and adopt speciﬁ c 
policies, including human rights policy, environmental policy 
and supply chain policy.
Going concern
Flow Traders, having made appropriate enquiries, consider 
that adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, 
therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the 2020 ﬁ nancial statements. In reaching these

All available capital is CET1, the quality highest capital, 
reﬂ ecting equity and retained earnings. In addition, as set 
out in the chapter Remuneration, part of our variable 
remuneration is fully discretionary and deferred over 
multiple instalments. If the company faces operational 
losses these variable compensation elements are reduced 
or forfeited entirely to cover for such loss. Although this is 
an important additional capital buffer, this is not reﬂ ected in 
the regulatory capital calculations above. 
Our Pillar III disclosures pursuant to CRR can be requested 
through our website www.ﬂ owtraders.com around the time

Starting 31 March 2018 the company meets the regulatory 
requirements of the EU Capital Requirement Regulation 
(CRR), which prescribes capital and reporting requirements. 
These regulatory capital requirements are supervised by the 
Dutch Central Bank in respect of Flow Traders B.V. and the 
company. The regulatory capital requirement consists of the 
requirements calculated under CRR, reﬂ ecting an 8 percent 
charge over risk weighted assets, and a Capital Conservation 
buffer of 2.5 percent, totaling 10.5 percent during 2020.

In control statement
The Management Board is responsible for designing and 
maintaining an adequate system for risk management and 
internal control. In order to facilitate this, the Risk and 
Mid-Ofﬁ ce department assessed the controls in this process 
and reported its ﬁ ndings to the Management Board. These 
ﬁ ndings have been evaluated by the Management Board 
and by the Supervisory Board. For a more elaborate 
explanation of our efforts in this regard, please refer to the 
chapter Our governance.
On the basis of the above, and in accordance with best 
practice provision 1.4.3 of the Corporate Governance Code, 
and with due observance of the limitations stated below, 
we conﬁ rm that to the best of our knowledge:
 
◾
The annual report provides sufﬁ cient insights into any 
failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk 
management and control systems (see chapter Our 
governance);
 
◾
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁ nancial and tax reporting does not 
contain any material inaccuracies (see chapter Our 
governance);
 
◾
Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justiﬁ ed that the ﬁ nancial reporting is 
prepared on a going concern basis (see chapters Value 
creation and strategy, Our performance and Financial 
statements); and
 
◾
The report states those material risks and uncertainties 
that are relevant to the expectation of the company’s 
continuity for the period of twelve months after the 
preparation of the report (see chapters Value creation 
and strategy, Our performance, Our governance and 
Financial statements).
Management and control
Our global capital position is managed on a daily and 
intra-day level by the Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department. 
The Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department checks our positions 
and capital posted at every prime broker for correctness and 
compares these numbers with the relevant prime broker or 
regulatory requirements. Separately, the Finance 
department prepares a rolling 15-month forecast for our 
capital positions, every month. 
As part of our regulatory capital management cycle, the Risk 
and Mid-Ofﬁ ce departments daily prepares a report that 
shows all the group’s positions and capital versus the CRR 
capital requirements. At the end of every quarter the 
company and Flow Traders B.V. report their capital 
requirements and corresponding coverage to the Dutch 
Central Bank. 
A ﬁ nal part of the internal risk management and capital 
cycle is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP). The ICAAP comprises a review of prevalent 
risks, the capital management processes, the risk 
management framework and an assessment of capital 
adequacy and reports this to the Dutch Central Bank 
annually. The Dutch Central Bank assesses the capital 
adequacy based on this report.

(Vice-Chairman), Olivier Bisserier, Rudolf Ferscha, Roger 
Hodenius and Han Sikkens. Han Sikkens chose not to opt for 
reappointment, his mandate ended at the end of the AGM, 
held on 24 June 2020. For more information, please refer to 
the chapter Report of the Supervisory Board and the 
Supervisory Board Rotation schedule as published on our 
website. 
 
Appointing and dismissing Supervisory Board members 
Supervisory Board members are appointed for a term of 
a maximum of four years and may be reappointed for 
a second term of a maximum of four years. After having 
served two terms, a Supervisory Board member may then be 
reappointed for a term of maximum two years, which may 
be extended by at most two years. The Supervisory Board 
Proﬁ le and the Equal Opportunity Policy will be taken into 
account at each (re)appointment. 
When a member of the Supervisory Board is to be 
appointed, suspended or removed, the Supervisory Board 
makes a non-binding nomination or proposal. Following 
a nomination by the Supervisory Board, the General Meeting 
may appoint a Supervisory Board member by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast, representing more than one third 
of the issued capital of the company. Appointment of 
a different candidate than the one proposed by the 
Supervisory Board requires an absolute majority of the votes 
cast at the General Meeting, representing at least 50 percent 
of the issued capital of the company. If votes within the 
Supervisory Board meeting tie on the proposed nomination, 
account. Decisions are thus made in a balanced manner. 
The Supervisory Board is alert to indications of misconduct 
or irregularities. It supervises the Management Board when 
appropriate follow-up actions are taken. In case of a conﬂ ict 
of interest, the Supervisory Board is responsible for the 
decision-making on how to handle conﬂ icts of interest. 
The functioning of the Supervisory Board as a whole and the 
functioning of its members individually is evaluated at least 
once a year. A succession plan for the Supervisory Board is in 
place, with the Supervisory Board Proﬁ le and the Equal 
Opportunity Policy taken into account. We also have

The Chair of the Audit Committee, Olivier Bisserier, 
has extensive experience of preparing and auditing ﬁ nancial 
statements from his time at PwC.
Remuneration & Appointment Committee
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee drafts 
proposals for the company’s remuneration policy. 
At Flow Traders, the remuneration and selection and 
appointment committees have been merged into one. 
It proposes the remuneration of the individual members 
of the Management Board to the Supervisory Board, 
and reviews the proposal of the Management Board of the 
annual remuneration and variable compensations of all 
employees. It is also responsible for carrying out annual 
assessments of the individual members of the Supervisory 
Board and the Management Board and the composition 
and size of the respective Boards. Where necessary, 
the Remuneration & Appointment Committee drafts 
proposals for (re)appointments, drafts selection criteria 
and appointment procedures for the Supervisory Board 
and Management Board. The committee draws up a plan 
for the succession of Management Board and Supervisory 
Board members. It also supervises the Management Board 
regarding the selection criteria and appointment procedures 
for senior management. The Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee takes note of the individual Management Board 
members’ view regarding the amount and structure of their 
own remuneration.
The Management Board sets values contributing to the 
long-term value creation. The Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee discusses these values, focusing 
on the strategy and business model, the environment and 
the existing culture within the company.

Supervisory Board. They each report their ﬁ ndings to the 
Supervisory Board, which is ultimately responsible for all 
decision-making. Terms of Reference apply for each 
committee and the relevant Management Board members 
and relevant others having a standing invitation for each 
committee meeting. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee discusses the annual, half-yearly and 
quarterly results and supervises the provision of the 
company’s ﬁ nancial information. It also advises the 
Supervisory Board on the nomination of the external 
auditor, who is appointed by the General Meeting. The Audit 
Committee is in regular contact with the Internal Audit 
Function and the external auditor, monitors the auditor’s 
independence and discusses the audit plans and 
recommendations of the internal and external auditor. 
In addition to advising the Management Board on ﬁ nancing, 
tax policy and tax risk framework, the Audit Committee is 
also responsible for supervising relevant (tax) legislation 
and regulations and the Code of Conduct. The design and 
operation of the internal risk management and control 
systems are discussed in the Risk Committee in more detail, 
as well as in the Audit Committee. 
In addition to the Management Board members, the Global 
Head of Finance, the (Interim) Global Head of Internal Audit 
and relevant others were invited to Audit Committee 
meetings. 
The Audit Committee is not chaired by the Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board or a former member of the Management 
Board. More than half of its members is independent.

of the Supervisory Board must be approved by the Dutch 
Central Bank (DNB). The DNB needs to be notiﬁ ed in writing 
in case of reappointments of members of the Supervisory 
Board.
Following a proposal by the Supervisory Board the General 
Meeting may suspend or remove members of the 
Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast.

Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee is responsible for 
providing advice to the Management Board on the 
company’s development, performance and sustainability of 
its trading strategies. It is also responsible for reviewing the 
company’s technology budget, supervising the operation of 
the company’s security systems, and assessing the state of 
the company’s technology in terms of competitiveness and 
functionality at least once a year. The committee supervises 
the Management Board on the operations of the company’s 
security systems and related risks. It maintains regular 
contact with our trading and technology departments. 
The Management Board members and relevant others may, 
from time to time, be invited to the Trading & Technology 
Committee meetings.
adequate resources and appropriate access to information, 
bearing in mind that it should be able to function sufﬁ ciently 
independently from Management. The Risk Committee also 
undertakes preparatory work for the Supervisory Board’s 
decision-making regarding the supervision of the integrity 
and quality of the effectiveness of the company’s internal 
risk management and control systems. Subsequently, 
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal 
risk management and control systems are discussed with 
the Management Board, and reported to the Supervisory 
Board.
The committee maintains regular contact with the 
company’s Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce departments. In addition to 
the Management Board members, relevant others may, 
from time to time, be invited to attend the Risk Committee 
meetings. 
Depending on the topics discussed, the Management Board 
members, relevant Global Heads or relevant others are 
present at the Remuneration & Appointment Committee 
meetings.
Compliant with the Corporate Governance Code provision 
2.3.4, the Remuneration & Appointment Committee is not 
chaired by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or 
a former member of the Management Board. 
Risk Committee
The duties of the Risk Committee include supervising and 
monitoring the operation of our internal risk management 
and control systems, and advising the Management Board 
on these operations. It reviews the company’s risk 
assessment processes and control systems, at least 
annually. The committee also monitors the manner in which 
the company’s risk management function is provided with 
Dilemmas
We face a variety of dilemmas in our various roles as an entrepreneur, employer and listed 
company. In addition to applying internal rules and regulations, such as the Code of Conduct 
and the Whistleblower Policy, we try to assess and resolve any dilemmas by applying common 
sense, remaining aware of our role within society. However, some dilemmas are ongoing and 
require constant attention. One of the dilemmas we currently face is:
Maintaining our exceptional culture
Our internal culture is one of our most cherished strengths. Our entrepreneurial, innovative 
and team-oriented culture supports an open environment where everyone can be themselves, 
conﬁ dent in the knowledge they can express their thoughts and ideas openly. Our dilemma is 
how to maintain this environment as the company grows. As we employ more people and 
expand geographically, it can become more challenging to maintain the ‘family spirit’ and 
ensure everyone feels connected on the same level. This has been brought into further focus 
with the advent of increased levels of working from home following the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic. We have taken speciﬁ c steps to ease some of the stresses caused by working from 
home as well as ensuring colleagues still feel connected to the broader company (by 
organizing online events etc.). We continue to carry out surveys to better understand how 
employees feel about Flow Traders, and whether they recognize and can relate to the culture, 
and discuss the importance of culture at the top levels of the organization.
Quoting every product vs being selective
Seeking to provide quotes on every product would theoretically provide greater opportunity 
to generate NTI. However, the dilemma exists as this needs to be balanced with the costs and 
effort required to achieve such coverage from a technology, trading and pricing and hedging 
perspective. Trading and regulatory capital would also be another key consideration given 
some products by their nature consume more capital than others.

Our risk management
Flow Traders’ Risk Management Framework 
(RMF) forms the foundation of our approach to 
managing risks. The RMF is documented in Flow 
Traders’ Risk Management Policy and is reviewed 
annually by our Management Board.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify and 
document potential risks which are inherent to trading in an 
automated environment. In the very dynamic environment 
of automated trading we designed our RMF in such a way 
that it is robust, efﬁ cient and transparent. In the ﬁ gure 
below we summarize our stakeholders to which we are 
obliged to deliver such a framework.
The RMF helps us to ensure sufﬁ cient internal control and 
(internal) capital through a consistent, continuous and 
careful method for addressing, managing and prioritizing 
our key risks in the context of our enterprise-wide strategic 
objectives.

Risk category
Context
STRATEGIC RISKS
Business and Strategic 
risk
This concerns risk related to our strategy, business model and market conditions. Market activity risk is 
part of this risk as our NTI and proﬁ tability are primarily a function of the level of trading activity, or 
trading volumes, in the ﬁ nancial instruments in which we trade.
Compliance and 
regulatory risk
Compliance risk is the threat posed to a company’s earnings or capital as a result of violation or 
non-conformance with laws, regulations, or prescribed practices. It also concerns the risk of changing 
laws and regulations (regulatory risk).
In addition, it includes the risk that the integrity of the organization or its operations is jeopardized as a 
result of unethical behavior of the organization, its staff members or management.
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or 
products. Concentration risk also includes supplier dependency risks.
Legal risk
The legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from a claim, failure to adhere to legally binding agreements and 
requirements, or failure to adequately legally protect assets of the ﬁ rm.
Reputation risk
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
IT risk
The IT risk concerns the risk of loss resulting from inadequate information technology and processing in 
terms of availability, manageability, integrity, controllability and continuity, insufﬁ cient protection, or 
inadequate IT strategy and policy or inadequate use.
IT security risk
This concerns risks relating to access management, cybersecurity and data integrity risks.
Operational risk
The operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people or 
from external events. The main driver of operational risk is human error.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that there is not sufﬁ cient trading capital or regulatory capital available. 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market prices; in particular, changes in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in trading in or issuing a ﬁ nancial 
instrument defaulting on an obligation.
Enterprise Risk Management
We aim for a good balance between our business activities, 
return on capital and related risks. Flow Traders’ Risk 
Management adopts its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
approach to ensure that our risk appetite and proﬁ le are 
integrated in our day-to-day operations and strategic, 
tactical and operational objective setting and decision 
making. 
Our ERM activities follow the annual cycle. Every year our 
Management Board sets its business targets following the 
strategic goals. Based on the targets and objectives, 
the Management Board formulates its risk appetite. 
The targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to the 
various departments within the company and are used to 
derive our strategic risks. 
We implement our Risk Management cycle to ensure that 
the residual risk proﬁ le is (and remains) in line with the set 
risk appetite. To achieve this, we perform risk (self-) 
assessments (RSA) to identify and assess current and newly 
arisen risks. Following the RSAs, the Management Board 
decides on the appropriate risk response.
Risk categories
We identify three general risk categories - Strategic risks, 
Operational risks and Financial risks - each with their own 
speciﬁ c risks areas:

Category Deﬁ nition
Risk Appetite
CREDIT RISK
Strategic Risk
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of Flow 
Trader’s business plan, from strategic changes in 
the business environment, and/or from adverse 
strategic business decisions.
Flow Traders is prepared to take risk in a responsible 
way which: (i) takes our stakeholders’ interests into 
account and (ii) is consistent with our business 
objectives. We hold ourselves, as well as our 
employees, responsible for acting with honesty, 
integrity and respect, including complying with our 
Code of Conduct, applicable laws and regulations 
everywhere we do business.
Financial Risk
Risk relating to positions in our Trading Book, 
including risks primarily related to Market Risk, 
Liquidity Risk and Credit Risk.
The ﬁ rm manages Financial risk carefully by applying 
a strict set of criteria in its dealings with 
counterparties, issuers and other relevant ﬁ nancial 
institutions. In addition we manage our ﬁ nancial 
positions through sound risk management principles.
Operational Risk
The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people and systems or from 
external events. This deﬁ nition includes legal risk, 
but excludes strategic and reputational risk.
Flow Traders is inevitably exposed to Operational 
Risk, as a result of conducting its business operations 
at operational, tactical and strategic levels. The ﬁ rm 
does not aim to completely eliminate this risk as this 
would signiﬁ cantly impair its ability to achieve its 
business objectives.

Risk Management Governance 
The effectiveness of risk management is unavoidably linked 
to commitment and integrity. It is therefore crucial that the 
Management Board, global and local department heads, 
and all Flow Traders employees are aware of the company’s 
risk exposure and their own responsibilities, as well as the 
responsibilities of Flow Traders as a whole.
Our risk management is embedded in the organization in line 
with the three lines of defense model.
The ﬁ rst line of defense is formed by Trading, Technology 
and Operations. These departments are crucial for the core 
processes within Flow Traders and are responsible for 
incorporating preventive and detective controls in the day to 
day trading and IT processes and for the continuous 
monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and trading controls.
The second line of defense is responsible for oversight and 
monitoring regarding risks, rules and requirements. 
Risk Management, Compliance and Finance manage risks 
through a combination of preventive and detective controls. 
Together they are responsible for the continuous risk 
management of Flow Traders.
The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’ Internal 
Audit Function (IAF). They assess the design and operation 
of our internal risk management and control systems. 
The IAF carries out its audit work in accordance with the 
Group Internal Audit Charter, as approved and implemented 
in March 2018.

Every year the Management Board sets its business targets 
following the strategic goals. The strategic goals are 
generally formulated in November/December. 
The Supervisory Board, together with the Management 
Board, approves the strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Supervisory Board is involved in the 
strategy setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are then 
translated into annual companywide, departmental and 
individual goals and discussed in an annual meeting with the 
Management Board and all Managing Directors.
Based on the targets and objectives, the Management Board 
formulates the risk appetite of the company.
The targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to the 
various departments within Flow Traders and are used to 
derive the company’s strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management cycle is implemented to 
ensure that the net risk proﬁ le is and stays in line with the 
set risk appetite. To do so, we perform Risk Self 
Assessments to identify and assess current and newly arisen 
risks. Following the Risk Self Assessments, department 
heads in cooperation with the Management Board will 
decide on the appropriate risk response. The effects of the 
chosen risk responses will be monitored and every year the 
actual net risk proﬁ le will be mapped versus the appetite.
Risk reporting
We have a standing risk committee that continuously 
assesses the risks we face in our business, comprised of our 
Global Head of Risk and the Management Board. Aside from 
ongoing ad-hoc communication, there is a recurring meeting 
set up in which they discuss all risk assessments and risk 
proposals related to position limits, strategies, procedures,

products and continuous monitoring, aim to minimize this 
risk. Our trading philosophy is that we hedge our positions as 
perfectly as possible and therefore minimize exposures.
Market activity risk (business risk)
Our NTI and proﬁ tability are primarily a function of the level 
of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the ﬁ nancial 
instruments in which we trade, and the bid-ask spreads 
(which largely determine the proﬁ t on the trade, or margins, 
we capture). Trading volumes in securities, derivatives and 
other ﬁ nancial instruments on exchanges and in other 
trading venues worldwide are directly affected by factors 
beyond our control, including economic and political 
Supervisory Board, as all members of the Supervisory Board 
are members of the Risk Committee. For more information, 
please refer to the chapter Report of the Supervisory Board.
Key risks
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from unfavorable 
market movements, such as prices, when positions in 
ﬁ nancial instruments are held. The value of a ﬁ nancial 
instrument may ﬂ uctuate because of changes in factors 
such as equity prices, currency rates, future dividend 
expectations, interest rates and volatilities. Our hedging 
strategies, in combination with the use of straightforward 
capital requirements and other requirements of prime 
brokers and market developments. Any major changes to 
our risk systems, strategies and limit setting must 
subsequently be approved by the Management Board. 
In addition to the standing risk committee, the company has 
a Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. All members of 
the Supervisory Board are members of this Risk Committee. 
The Management Board informs the Risk Committee of the 
Supervisory Board about the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems. This includes the 
reasonable assurance that the aforementioned systems do 
not contain any material inaccuracies. In addition, the tasks 
of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board includes 
supervision and monitoring, as well as advising the 
Management Board on the operation of the company’s 
internal risk management and control systems. The Risk 
Committee is also responsible for providing advice to the 
Management Board on the company’s development, 
performance, and sustainability of its trading strategies, 
as well as reviewing the risk of the company. It maintains 
regular contact with the company’s Trading and Risk and 
Operations departments. For more information on the 
responsibilities of our Risk Committee, please see the 
chapter Our governance.
Following a review of the company’s risk assessment 
processes, the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems has been identiﬁ ed as 
a priority and as a joint responsibility of the Supervisory

Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. This means that

systems and the data that is being exchanged is subject to 
prior conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are ﬂ agged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, 
we continuously review to ensure it adequately captures 
relevant scenarios. This year with the COVID-19 global 
pandemic we made substantial changes to our back up site 
management. 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we 
commence trading on new platforms, including platforms 
designated for trading digital assets. While many of such 
platforms remain unregulated, many have strongly 
improved their own onboarding procedures and 
counterparty identiﬁ cation procedures. While we believe our 
own procedures are strong and trading on such platforms is 
quite limited, the unregulated status of such platforms and 
their location in emerging economies makes them inherently 
less institutionalized and supervised than regulated 
platforms in developed economies.
Regulatory risk
While we do not have clients and do not provide investment 
services or ancillary services to third parties, our markets 
and nearly all aspects of our business are heavily regulated. 
Where applicable, entities forming part of our group have 
obtained the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses. 
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in four 
international jurisdictions and in addition we have opened 
a branch ofﬁ ce in London in 2018 and a branch ofﬁ ce in 
Milan in November 2020. As a group we currently trade on 
more than 180 venues worldwide. In addition, we operate on 
various venues through brokers. As we have to comply with 
subjected to a review of its code, testing in an environment 
that is separate from our production environment, validation 
in limited production (processing a strictly limited number of 
trades) on one trading desk in respect of trading a single 
ﬁ nancial instrument, followed by more extensive testing 
across multiple desks and/or trading multiple ﬁ nancial 
instruments. Each step, and progressive steps, 
is documented. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control undisrupted 
trading activities in real time. Multilayer monitoring is 
employed to avoid errors, but when these occur the relevant 
teams are notiﬁ ed via multiple notiﬁ cation channels. We rely 
on multiple third party service providers for business and 
market data. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with our 
proprietary technology platform, analyzing real-time pricing 
data, and is designed to ensure that our order activity is 
conducted within strict pre-determined trading and position 
limits. For example, our pre-trade risk controls are designed 
to prevent the trading engines from sending quotes which 
deviate from our pre-deﬁ ned risk parameters, such as price 
and volume limits set by the Risk Management department, 
which keeps our ordering, trading and positions well within 
tolerance levels. Our monitoring tools reconcile trades, 
prices and positions against those of our exchanges and 
prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration tests 
by external experts. We have a comprehensive IT security 
system that is designed to protect us from attacks both 
from inside and outside the platform. Where we have 
a technical interface with institutions like our prime brokers 
and exchanges, the integrity of the connection between the 
conditions, broad trends in business and ﬁ nance, regulatory 
requirements, actions by central banks, and changes in the 
markets in which such transactions occur.
To cope with periods of little market activity, we diversify in 
products and markets traded. This is to safeguard that we 
are not too dependent on the levels of market activity in 
one asset class or product category. 
Operational risk
Operational risk is deﬁ ned as the risk of loss arising from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or 
external events. Operational risk management is an integral 
part of Flow Traders’ management information and control 
systems. As our operational risks are concentrated in 
technology events at exchanges and clearing members, 
our investment in technology is important to mitigate those 
associated risks. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, 
high-performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new hardware 
and software. Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement improvements in 
both hardware and software on an ongoing basis. Controlled 
releases of hardware and software enhancements provide 
for minimal disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or updates 
of our trading software) is being developed is strictly 
separated from the environment in which such trading 
software operates in production. Access to the source code 
is strictly controlled and limited. Prior to releasing our 
trading software, or an update into the production 
environment, any element of our trading software is

Environmental risk
While Flow Traders considers its overall impact on the 
environment to be low, we have nonetheless identiﬁ ed 
certain environmental risks to our business:
 
◾
Physical environmental risks such as earthquakes, 
forest ﬁ res and ﬂ oods could negatively impact our 
physical infrastructure. This is particularly relevant to 
our server locations which are distributed globally. 
Climate change will likely lead an increase in extreme 
weather events in the future. We mitigate this risk by 
having a widely distributed server infrastructure high 
degree of system redundancy. In addition, recent forest 
ﬁ res in South East Asia have led to the closure of our 
Singapore ofﬁ ce. This was mitigated by activities 
transferring to other ofﬁ ce locations.
 
◾
Regulation may affect Flow Traders ﬁ nancially by 
putting a price on CO2 and other greenhouse gas 
emissions, In addition, CO2 pricing may have an impact 
on how seek to offset our carbon footprint in the 
coming years.
Notwithstanding the above, we see opportunities relating to 
the environment and in mitigating climate change in that 
a relentless focus on energy efﬁ ciency and reducing waste 
can reduce our ﬁ xed operational expenses. This in turn 
makes our business more resilient and sustainable from 
a risk management perspective.
External risk
Given the highly interconnected nature of the ﬁ nancial 
markets ecosystem we are a part of, we recognize that 
should any of the risks referenced within this section 
materialize, there could be a negative impact on various 
external third parties. Speciﬁ cally, market and operational 
risk events could negatively impact key parties within our 
nature of our business, we are regularly subject to routine 
(and sometimes more targeted) inquiries and audits from 
regulators and trading venues. It is difﬁ cult to predict or 
manage the outcome of such inquiries, although we aim to 
be as transparent and cooperative as possible given the 
circumstances.
We continuously invest in good professional relationships 
with trading venues, regulators and other relevant parties. 
Flow Traders is a founding member of the FIA European 
Principal Traders Association (FIA EPTA), a member of the 
FIA Principal Traders Group (FIA PTG) in the US and 
a member of FIA Asia. These are industry groups that consist 
of leading principal trading ﬁ rms. We are also a member of 
the Dutch Association of Proprietary Traders (APT), 
operating as an industry body of Netherlands-based 
liquidity providers. As part of these important groups, 
we continue to promote, foremost, the principle that all 
markets and market participants should be adequately and 
transparently regulated. Within these groups we contribute 
to discussions regarding current and new regulations 
including IFR/IFD, MiFID II, Brexit, post trading matters, 
market structure and market regulations. We will continue 
to contribute to these discussions and will persist in 
maximizing transparency in respect of our industry, 
its beneﬁ ts for all market participants and fair, orderly and 
transparent ﬁ nancial markets.

members and the Supervisory Board members can be found

our home regulations, local regulations and trading rules of 
all venues on which we trade, our regulatory landscape is 
vast. Legislators and regulators worldwide strengthen their 
supervision within our environment, demanding 
a professional and well-structured compliance organization.
Our Compliance department assists management and 
operations at group and local level by identifying, advising 
on, reviewing and reporting on regulations. It also seeks to 
maintain a compliant business environment through training 
and monitoring in order to ensure and enhance the group’s 
conformance with its regulatory obligations. 
The Compliance, Risk and Operations departments have 
promulgated and implemented risk controls, internal rules 
and regulations that were developed following regulatory 
requirements, guidelines from market authorities, industry 
best practices and our own best practices. Laws and 
regulations, including tax laws, are subject to change or can 
be interpreted differently in practice over time. 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements could adversely affect our 
reputation, proﬁ tability and prospects. This may also be the 
case for differences in interpretation or lack of timely or 
complete implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include ﬁ nes, penalties, disgorgements and 
censures, suspension or expulsion from trading venues or 
the revocation or limitation of licenses. We aim to minimize 
such risks by focusing considerable management attention, 
employing highly-qualiﬁ ed compliance and risk 
professionals, deploying training, monitoring and reporting 
systems, and continuously evaluating and implementing 
current and upcoming regulation on our operations. 
Notwithstanding such efforts, given the highly regulated

This diverse composition entails constructive dialogues and 
shared responsibility, resulting in an effective and efﬁ cient 
Supervisory Board. Our Equal Opportunity Policy can be 
found on our website: www.ﬂ owtraders.com. 
General Meeting, shares and shareholders 
Flow Traders highly encourages shareholder participation in 
the decision-making of the General Meeting. It is of great 
importance to the company that its shareholders have an 
actual say in the Annual General Meeting (AGM), and the 
company therefore encourages an open dialogue. 
Flow Traders ensures that the General Meeting is adequately 
provided with information.
Agenda items of the AGM that need to be handled as 
separate agenda items on the basis of the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Dutch Civil Code or the Articles of 
Association will be handled as such. 
Flow Traders holds an AGM within six months following the 
end of the ﬁ nancial year. The agenda for this meeting 
includes the adoption of the annual accounts, the content of 
the annual report covering the previous year’s ﬁ nancial 
business, the policy of the company on additions to reserves 
and on distributions of proﬁ ts, any proposal to distribute 
proﬁ ts, (re)appointment of the external auditor, substantial 
changes in the governance structure of the company and in 
the compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, 
material changes to the Articles of Association, ﬁ lling 
vacancies on the Management Board and/or Supervisory 
Board, proposals placed on the agenda by the Management 
Board, and the release from liability of the members of the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board for their 
value chain; namely counterparties and prime brokers. There 
could be a risk to our counterparties’ ability to trade with us 
or settlement trades effectively on a timely basis. Moreover, 
the various prime brokers we work closely with could also be 
exposed to risk.
Diversity
The Supervisory Board has drawn up and adopted an Equal 
Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy). In this policy we explain 
our objective to treat everyone equally during the hiring 
process and throughout their careers at Flow Traders. We are 
committed to being a truly equal opportunity employer, 
by recruiting, retaining and promoting people based on 
merit, and merit alone. We are a ﬁ rm believer in the beneﬁ ts 
of a diverse workplace and we do not make any concessions 
to quality. Our objective is to provide equal employment 
opportunities to all qualiﬁ ed job applicants and equal career 
perspectives for all of our employees, provided they 
perform highly. When positions become available, 
we actively encourage all candidates to apply and ensure 
that the selection and retention processes are truly equal 
for all applicants and employees. We aim to provide an 
inclusive work environment for all employees. This also 
holds for our Management Board and Supervisory Board. 
When it comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, we adhere to the same principles of 
equal opportunity as set out above. With the appointment 
of Britta Achmann as Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer and Management 
Board member, Flow Traders fully demonstrated its 
adherence to the Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy). 
Our current Supervisory Board, as a result of the Equal 
Opportunity Policy, is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
education, nationality, and professional backgrounds.

circumstances as a result of the pandemic, holding 
a physical AGM was not feasible this year and votes could 
not be cast in person. 
Amendment to the Articles of Association
The General Meeting may pass a resolution to amend the 
Articles of Association or to wind up the company with an 
absolute majority of the votes cast. This can only be done if 
the Management Board has proposed to amend the Articles 
of Association or wind up the company. Such proposal has to 
be approved by the Supervisory Board.
When a proposal to amend the Articles of Association or to 
wind up the company is made to the General Meeting, 
the intention to propose such resolution must be stated in 
the relevant notice convening the General Meeting. If it 
concerns an amendment to the Articles of Association, 
a copy of the proposal in which the proposed amendment is 
quoted verbatim must at the same time be deposited at the 
company’s ofﬁ ce and this copy shall be made available for 
inspection by the shareholders until the end of the General 
Meeting.
Issue of shares
Shares are issued by a decision of the Management Board. 
This decision must be approved by the Supervisory Board. 
During the 2020 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Management Board, subject to the 
Supervisory Board’s approval, to issue ordinary shares or to 
grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares up to and 
including 24 December 2021 for up to ten percent of the 
total number of shares issued at the time of the General 
Meeting for any purposes. Any issuance exceeding this limit 
needs approval by the General Meeting.
Risk Ofﬁ cer, granting the authority to issue shares and the 
authority to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights (see 
below for more detail), granting the authority to acquire own 
shares and the authority to cancel own shares (see below) 
and reappointing EY as our external auditor. A positive 
advisory vote was cast on the remuneration report over the 
year 2019. The General Meeting and the Management Board 
discussed the results, dividend policy and governance 
structure of the company. The General Meeting voted 
against the Remuneration Policy for the members of the 
Management Board. 
Extraordinary General Meetings will be held if the 
Management Board or the Supervisory Board is requested to 
that effect in writing by one or more holders of shares (or 
holders of rights in rem (beperkte rechten) who also hold 
the voting rights in relation to those shares) individually or 
jointly representing ten percent or more of the issued share 
capital, specifying the details to be discussed. 
The company held no Extraordinary General Meeting in 
2020. Our next AGM is scheduled to be held on 23 April 2021. 
More information will become available on our website in 
due course.
Voting rights
Each share carries one vote at the AGM. Subject to certain 
exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles of 
Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed 
by an absolute majority of votes cast. Votes can be cast at 
the AGM either in person or by proxy. These proxies can be 
granted electronically or in writing to the company or to 
independent third parties, such as a civil-law notary. 
Following the Temporary Act COVID-19 (Tijdelijke Wet 
COVID-19) coming into effect and the unprecedented 
performance during the previous ﬁ nancial year. 
In accordance with the Shareholders Rights Directive, 
the remuneration report and, every four years, 
the remuneration policy is on the agenda for the AGM.
General Meetings can be held as often as the Management 
Board or the Supervisory Board deem necessary. A General 
Meeting is also convened in case of a decision entailing 
a signiﬁ cant change in the identity or character of the 
company or its business. 
One or more shareholders representing at least the 
statutory threshold of three percent of the voting rights may 
request that the Management Board places items on the 
agenda of a General Meeting. The Management Board must 
honor such a request provided that the request is received in 
writing at least 60 days before the date of such a meeting. 
Each shareholder is entitled – either in person or via proxy – 
to attend the AGM and to vote during the AGM. The AGM is 
the perfect place for shareholders and the Management 
Board and Supervisory Board to interact. At an AGM, 
shareholders can ask questions directly to the Management 
Board and/or the Supervisory Board. Our Management 
Board and Supervisory Board strongly encourage 
shareholders to interact. 
In 2020, the AGM was held virtually due to the COVID-19 
measures. During this AGM held on 24 June 2020, 
shareholders voted, inter alia, in favor of adopting the 2019 
annual accounts, determining the total dividend at €0.90 per 
share, on the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board, 
discharging members of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board from liability, the appointment of Britta 
Achmann as member of the Management Board and Chief

by the General Meeting over the course of 2018, 2019 and 
2020. 
At the 2021 AGM the Management Board will propose to the 
General Meeting to (i) renew its authorization to repurchase 
shares in the company, and (ii) cancel shares in the share 
capital of the Company held or repurchased by the Company 
under the aforementioned authorization to repurchase 
shares in the Company.
Cancelation of shares
Shares may be canceled by the company by a decision of the 
Management Board. This decision must be approved by the 
Supervisory Board. During the 2020 AGM, our shareholders 
voted for the authorization of the Management Board to, 
subject to the Supervisory Board’s approval, cancel shares in 
the share capital of the company. The number of shares that 
can be canceled, shall be determined by the Management 
Board, but may not exceed ten percent of the issued share 
capital at 25 June 2020, i.e. up to 4,653,450 shares can be 
canceled. The cancelation may be executed in one or more 
parts. 
Major shareholders
The following shareholders ﬁ led their interests in the capital 
of the company exceeding 3% to be included in the AFM’s 
register of substantial holdings and gross short positions as 
published on the website www.afm.nl (data as published on 
31 December 2020). A shareholder must ﬁ le or update its 
holdings if its interest exceeds, or drops below, 3%, 5%, 10%, 
15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. 
Based on the publications in two of the public AFM 
Registers: the Register on substantial holdings and gross 
short positions; and the Register on notiﬁ cations by directors 
and members of the supervisory board, the table below 
Repurchase and purchase of shares
Shares may be repurchased by the company by a decision of 
the Management Board. This decision must be approved by 
the Supervisory Board. During the 2020 AGM, our 
shareholders renewed the authority of the Management 
Board to, subject to the Supervisory Board’s approval, 
acquire shares in the capital of the company, either through 
purchase on a stock exchange or otherwise. The authority 
applies up to and including 24 December 2021, under the 
following conditions: the repurchase (i) may constitute up to 
ten percent of the total number of shares issued at the time 
of the General Meeting; (ii) provided that the company will 
not hold more shares in stock than ten percent of the issued 
share capital; and (iii) at a price (excluding expenses) not less 
than the nominal value of the shares and not higher than the 
opening price on Euronext Amsterdam on the day of 
repurchase plus ten percent. Any repurchases exceeding 
these limits need approval by the General Meeting. 
Flow Traders announced two share repurchase plans in 
2020. A €20 million share buyback was launched on 
7 February 2020 and was completed on 5 May 2020. 
On 12 November 2020, Flow Traders’ commenced the 
repurchase of shares for a total aggregate consideration of 
up to €30 million for a period of up to 12 months, 
in connection with its employee incentive plans. 
In order to align our employees’ interests with those of our 
shareholders, the company awards 100 shares in the 
company to most employees with a tenure of over two 
years. To thank the employees for their exceptional 
commitment during these unprecedented times, employees 
were awarded an additional number of shares, the number 
of shares varying between 50 and 250 per employee, 
depending on their tenure within the company. The company 
purchased part of such shares under the authority granted 
In addition, the General Meeting renewed the authority of 
the Management Board, subject to the Supervisory Board’s 
approval, to restrict or exclude applicable pre-emptive 
rights when issuing ordinary shares or granting rights to 
subscribe for ordinary shares up to and including 
24 December 2021. 
At our next AGM, scheduled to be held on 23 April 2021, 
the Management Board intends to request that the General 
Meeting renews its authorization to issue shares for up to 
ten percent of the total number of shares issued at the time 
of the AGM for any purposes.

the company becoming subject to insolvency procedures, 
liquidation, delisting, a merger or spin-off (with the company 
as disappearing entity).
No dedicated take-over protection structures
Flow Traders does not employ any of the following 
dedicated take-over protection structures: preference 
shares, depositary receipts or call options issued to vehicles 
conducive to protecting the company’s interest or 
independence.
Compliance and transparency
Focus on anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
Flow Traders is a strong proponent of effective, efﬁ cient and 
equal regulation and contributes to the regulatory dialogue 
in our key jurisdictions as we want markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
We commit to complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations that apply to us, wherever we operate, including 
in respect of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering laws. Integrity and transparency is central to the 
way we run our business, from our Management Board and 
Supervisory Board to all our staff, regardless of their role. 
The company encourages an open culture within its 
organization and expects its employees to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations and internal policies. 
Each employee is responsible for ensuring an honest and 
ethical conduct of business within the company. We have 
issued a Code of Conduct, which forms part of our 
employment documentation. This Code of Conduct can be

replacement). This right expires, in respect of each relevant 
party, if such party ceases to, directly or indirectly, 
hold more than ﬁ ve percent of the shares in the company 
provided that and for as long as, in aggregate, Avalon 
Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. together continue 
to, directly or indirectly, hold more than ﬁ ve percent of the 
company’s shares, Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak 
Investments B.V. shall be entitled to jointly designate one 
Supervisory Board member for appointment. 
The relationship agreement also governs the composition of 
the Supervisory Board committees. The agreement 
terminates in respect of each of the shareholders, if such 
party’s aggregate shareholding in the company (be it direct, 
indirect or together with a permitted transferee) falls below 
ﬁ ve percent of the company’s outstanding share capital. 
In case of, among other things, the company becoming 
subject to insolvency procedures, liquidation, delisting, 
a merger or a spin-off (with the company as disappearing 
entity), the agreement automatically terminates.
Under the shareholders’ agreement governed by Dutch law, 
Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. have agreed 
on certain arrangements in respect of their shareholding in 
the company. These arrangements include an obligation for 
each of the parties to vote in favor of the appointment of 
any individual designated by any of them as a member of the 
Supervisory Board in accordance with the terms of the 
relationship agreement (as described above). Furthermore, 
the parties agreed to reserve the right to consult with each 
other and coordinate the exercise of their voting rights 
attached to their respective shares in the company. 
The shareholders’ agreement terminates for any party if 
such party’s aggregate shareholding in the company (be it 
direct or indirect) falls below three percent of the company’s 
shows the most accurate formation. For further details on 
individual shareholdings please refer to the AFM’s registers.

contractors, approved by the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. Employees are free to raise issues and 
have the responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, 
or any reasonable suspicions. During 2018, all employees 
were required to participate in an online course on the 
Whistleblower Policy, as part of the Flow Academy. As of 
2019, every new hire received this course, and every new hire 
will receive this course going forward, to create awareness 
and guidance on how to deal with misconducts and incidents 
described in Flow Traders whistleblower policy.
 
Circumstances may arise that cause an employee to feel 
insecure or unsafe to the extent that they may not want to 
use the usual reporting lines. The company provides 
employees with a safe way of reporting suspected 
misconducts within its organization and offers adequate 
protection. The Whistleblower Policy has wide applications, 
including in respect of topics such as fraud, market abuse, 
corruption, anti-money laundering, theft, bribery, 
dishonoring Flow Traders Global tax policy and any other 
structural misconduct that threatens the integrity and 
proper business conduct of Flow Traders. The Whistleblower 
Policy provides whistleblowers with anonymity, 
conﬁ dentiality, and the company will not impose sanctions 
on disclosure (or affect an employee’s legal position) when 
the employee reports a suspected misconduct in good faith, 
unless the employee is involved in the issue that is being 
reported. We respect a non-retaliation policy when 
a suspected misconduct is reported. Flow Traders’ 
Whistleblower Policy can be found on our website 
www.ﬂ owtraders.com.
any recipient, and no gifts nor favors of any substantial 
value may be given to authorities. Facilitation payments are 
not permitted. We provide clear and recurring guidance in 
that respect. As part of our constant monitoring, 
all expenses and gifts relating to external parties are 
checked by senior managers and employees have to state 
what the purpose of an expense was and who the recipient 
was.
We have zero tolerance towards bribery and corruption and 
we actively ensure that no such behavior occurs. No cases of 
bribery or corruption were reported in 2020.
Whistleblowers
In addition to our very strong culture of openness, 
transparency and participation, we also have an elaborate 
Whistleblower Policy in place for all staff and relevant 
We have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering (AML) policies in place that apply to all our staff. 
We expect our counterparties, business partners, 
intermediaries, contractors and subcontractors to adhere to 
the same standards. We believe that the risk of bribery or 
corruption is very limited as we do not hold or manage client 
money or assets. We trade ﬁ nancial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain production 
facilities or source raw materials. Nevertheless, staff 
receives training in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and AML 
practices, as the Management Board underlines the 
importance of these trainings.
Key to our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy is that 
ofﬁ cials or counterparties may never be placed in an 
uncomfortable position. No gifts nor favors may lead (or

equal employment opportunities to all qualiﬁ ed job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all 
employees, provided they perform highly. 
When positions become available, Flow Traders actively 
encourages all candidates to apply and ensure that the 
selection and retention processes are truly equal for all 
applicants and employees. This also holds for the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it 
comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, Flow Traders adheres to the same 
principle of equal opportunity as set out above. 
As a result, our current Supervisory Board is diverse in 
terms of, inter alia, age, education, nationality, 
and professional backgrounds. 
 
◾
Independence of Supervisory Board members
Best practice provision 2.1.7 provides that any one of the 
criteria referred to in best practice provision 2.1.8 (i.-v.) 
should be applicable to at most one Supervisory Board 
member and that the total number of Supervisory 
Board members to whom the criteria referred to in best 
practice provision 2.1.8 are applicable, should account 
for less than half of the total number of Supervisory 
Board Members. Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius, 
as founders of the company, were attracted to their 
role as Supervisory Board members because of their 
speciﬁ c business-related expertise. They do not qualify 
as independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they are former members of the 
Management Board of the company prior to its 
conversion and because they represent shareholders of 
the company owning an interest of over ten percent. 
Deviation from this provision is likely to continue until 
Roger Hodenius and Jan van Kuijk cease to be members 
of the Supervisory Board.
corporate bodies include the Management Board, 
the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting. 
The Management Board values and considers the interests 
of the various stakeholders involved. Good corporate 
governance results in effective decision-making in a manner 
which enhances shareholder value and enables a company 
to maintain a culture of integrity, transparency, and trust. 
The company has a long standing focus on a long-term 
value creation strategy, culture and risk. We acknowledge 
the importance of good corporate governance and endeavor 
to comply in general with the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code and comply fully with it, with the 
exception of the following provisions: 
 
◾
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
Best practice provision 2.1.5 provides that the 
Supervisory Board should draw up a diversity policy for 
the composition of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. The policy should address the 
concrete targets relating to diversity. Flow Traders 
deviates from best practice provision 2.1.5 as no 
concrete targets are set on diversity within the 
company. However, the Supervisory Board has drawn up 
and adopted an Equal Opportunity Policy addressing 
the diversity aspects of the composition of the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. We believe 
that this policy also attains the purpose of best practice 
provision 2.1.5. In our view, the policy contributes to 
good governance, as it reﬂ ects our objective to treat 
everyone equally during the hiring process and 
throughout their careers at Flow Traders. Flow Traders is 
committed to being a truly equal opportunity employer, 
by recruiting, retaining and promoting people based on 
merit, and merit alone. The company is a ﬁ rm believer in 
the beneﬁ ts of a diverse workplace and does not make 
any concessions to quality. The objective is to provide 
Internal audit
The Internal Audit Function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and objective 
assurance, advice, and insight. An efﬁ cient and effective 
Internal Audit Function contributes to strong internal 
controls and to a robust corporate governance structure, 
which can address signiﬁ cant risks. The scope of internal 
audit work includes the examination and evaluation of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of Flow Traders’ risk 
management, control and governance processes. Audit work 
includes also assessments of the quality of performance in 
carrying out assigned responsibilities to achieve Flow 
Traders’ stated goals and objectives. 
Our Group Internal Audit Charter deﬁ nes the Internal Audit 
Function’s purpose, authority, responsibility and position 
within Flow Traders. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance provided by 
the Institute of Internal Auditors. 
The Internal Audit Function is an integral part of our 
reporting cycle. The Internal Audit Function reports to the 
Audit Committee and to the CEO. It aligns its efforts with the 
external auditor and reports its audit results to the 
Management Board, the essence of its audit results to the 
Audit Committee and informs the external auditor. 
The Management Board assesses the way in which the 
Internal Audit Function fulﬁ ls its responsibility annually and 
takes the opinion of the Audit Committee into account.
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
The Corporate Governance Code deﬁ nes a company as 
a long-term form of collaboration between the principal 
corporate bodies of a company. For Flow Traders, these

If this proportion of the capital is not represented at the 
meeting, but an absolute majority of the votes cast is in 
favor of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of 
a nomination or to remove a board member, a new 
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may 
be passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
regardless of the proportion of the capital represented 
at the meeting. 
In deviation of this best practice provision, 
the company’s Articles of Association provide that the 
General Meeting may pass a resolution to cancel the 
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of 
a member of the Management Board or of the 
Supervisory Board and/or a resolution to remove 
a member of the Management Board or of the 
Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes 
cast, representing more than 50 percent of the 
company’s issued capital. In addition, the company’s 
Articles of Association provide that if this quorum is not 
present or represented at the meeting, such resolution 
cannot be adopted and in order for such a resolution to 
be adopted, a new meeting should be convened in 
which more than 50 percent of the company’s issued 
capital is represented and an absolute majority of the 
votes are cast in favor of such resolution.
the nature of our business activities and the fast paced 
industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable compensation 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a ﬁ nancial year 
while performing a single, one-off assessment at the 
end of the year as set out in the best practice 
provisions. Semi-annual discussions take place 
between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee for this 
purpose. In this manner, the Supervisory Board 
regularly assesses the performance indicators and the 
potential resulting variable compensation for the 
Management Board members. Targets are set for each 
individual Management Board member and the 
Management Board as a whole. Signiﬁ cant 
underperformance or overperformance in respect of 
these targets can result in reductions or increases of 
the proﬁ t share that is awarded to a Management Board 
member. 
 
◾
Quorum
Best practice provision 4.3.3 provides that the General 
Meeting of a company that is not subject to the 
statutory large company regime (structuurregime) may 
adopt a resolution to cancel the binding nature of 
a nomination for the appointment of a member of the 
Management Board or of the Supervisory Board and/or 
a resolution to remove a member of the Management 
Board or of the Supervisory Board by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast. According to the Corporate 
Governance Code, it may be provided that this majority 
should represent a given proportion of the issued 
capital, which proportion may not exceed one-third. 
 
◾
Independence of committee members
As Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent Supervisory Board members as set out 
above, this also affects two Supervisory Board 
committees of which they are members. Best practice 
provision 2.3.4 provides that more than half of the 
members of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee should be 
independent. Both Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius are 
members of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, implying that half (and not more than half) 
of its members are independent. Deviation from this 
provision is likely to continue until Roger Hodenius and 
Jan van Kuijk cease to be members of the Supervisory 
Board. 
 
◾
Analyses carried out in respect of variable 
compensation
Best practice provision 3.2.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code provides that the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee should submit a proposal to 
the Supervisory Board concerning the remuneration of 
individual members of the Management Board. 
The proposal is drawn up in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy that has been established and will, 
in any event, cover the remuneration structure, 
the amount of the ﬁ xed and variable remuneration 
components, the performance criteria used, 
the scenario analyses that are carried out and the pay 
ratios within the company and its afﬁ liated enterprises. 
We do not fully comply with the scenario analyses that 
are carried out as the variable remuneration for the 
members of the Management Board is contingent upon 
a future, unknown, metric: the accrued ﬁ rm-wide 
variable remuneration pool which itself depends on 
operating result for the given ﬁ nancial year. Because of

The global volume of exchange-traded 
products (ETPs) continues to rise, and at 
Flow Traders one element of this is the 
off-exchange trades we carry out with 
institutional investors across Europe, the 
United States and Asia.
In 2020, our 29-strong team of institu-
tional traders connected and traded with 
over 1,500 counterparties globally, and we 
expect this number to increase further in 
2021. Ron Heydenrijk, European Head of 
Sales and External Relations, Bill Stush, 
Head of Institutional Trading (US), and 
Viktor Östebo, Head of Institutional Trading 
(APAC), discuss the importance of institu-
tional trading for the company and their 
expectations for 2021.
What does Flow Traders offer institutional 
counterparties?
Bill: “Basically, the best execution 
available. We provide institutional 
counterparties with extremely broad ETF 
coverage, deep liquidity, competitive 
pricing, a global offering, and our response 
time is best-in-class.”
Ron: “Our global reach really is vital. 
Today’s investors are not regionally biased 
or limited—they want to invest wherever 
and whenever they want. With teams 
trading in Asia, Europe and the United 
States, we can provide institutional 
counterparties with seamless, round-the-
clock trading.”
Can you highlight some notable trends 
you’re observing among institutional 
counterparties?
Viktor: “Globally, we’re seeing a strong rise 
in the use of Request for Quote (RfQ) 
platforms, which enable counterparties to 
seek and respond to a quote electronically. 
This is great for investors, because the 
platforms place liquidity providers in 
competition with each other, while giving 
investors the option to trade on the best 
provided quote or not trade at that price at 
all. This means counterparties really get 
offered the sharpest price.”

Name: Ron Heydenrijk
Position: European Head of Sales and External Relations
Background: Ron joined Flow Traders from ABN AMRO to lead 
Institutional Trading in the EMEA markets, and manages our 
dealings with counterparties as well as issuers. 
Name: Bill Stush
Position: Head of Institutional Trading (US)
Background: Bill heads up Flow Traders’ Institutional Trading 
in the United States, with a focus on securing new 
counterparties while maintaining connections with existing 
ones.
Name: Viktor Östebo
Position: Head of Institutional Trading (APAC)
Background: Viktor leads our Institutional Trading in the 
Asia-Paciﬁ c region, with the aim of attracting new 
counterparties while continuing relationships with existing 
counterparties.
The COVID-19 pandemic has obviously been the key subject in 
2020. What impact did it have on the Institutional Trading 
business?
Viktor: “It was different to what we might have expected. 
This is very much a people’s business, and we are used to 
travelling to meet (potential) counterparties for face-to-
face discussions. Traveling, however, stopped almost 
completely, yet we still had very positive discussions 
virtually with potential counterparties on transparency, 
accuracy, efﬁ ciency, costs, reliability and response time: 
these issues were very important in 2020.”
Bill: “It was a surprisingly productive year. Our team 
responded tremendously well, working together, and we 
have managed to acquire new users in a shorter turnaround 
time than normal. I found that counterparties and potential 
counterparties were reaching out to me as much as I was to 
them, looking for advice or a chat.” 
Ron: “Onboarding went signiﬁ cantly better than we had 
anticipated at the start of the pandemic. We are seeing 
a market change, with ETFs truly coming of age, as investors 
recognize their reliability and the ease of investing. And this 
is having a knock-on effect for Institutional Trading, with 
more counterparties attracted to the products we offer and 
the strength of our service.” 
What are the main trends we’re seeing regionally, and what 
are your 2021 focus areas?
Viktor: “We’re seeing a strong shift to electroniﬁ cation via 
RfQ platforms like Bloomberg RfQE and Tradeweb in the 
Asia-Paciﬁ c region, and we expect that to continue. 
In terms of our overall Institutional Trading focus in 2021, in 
some ways we’re becoming a ‘traditional’ ﬁ rm. By that I 
mean that we are now trading with a huge variety of institu-
tional counterparties, including central banks. And this is 
down to our long-term principles of communicating openly 
with the market, being great at what we do, and being 
patient. I think we can say that the company has really 
arrived.” 
Ron: “In Europe, we already have strong market penetration 
in ETFs. We are connected to most of the counterparties 
that are trading, and so going forward it’s basically about 
increasing the number of products, in multiple asset 
classes, that we trade with our existing counterparties, 
while growing the number of counterparties we’re 
connected to. And we will also be looking to utilizing our 
data richness to increase transparency towards counter-
parties and ETF issuers.” 
Bill: “We want to head into 2021 with a full menu of 
offerings and the ability to provide counterparties with 
what they want. To achieve that, we’ll remain focused on 
being agile, reliable, and providing competitive quotes upon 
request.”
Finally, a question for Ron: having joined a few months ago, 
what are your initial views?
Ron: “I joined during the pandemic, so it was a very strange 
moment to arrive in a new job. I spent the ﬁ rst month 
working from home, and have yet to meet my team 
members in person. Only a limited number of staff are 
allowed in the ofﬁ ce, mask wearing is compulsory, and 
everyone is focused on staying healthy. Yet what’s 
absolutely clear is the tremendous energy and drive here in 
the ﬁ rm. People are extremely positive, optimistic and 
upbeat about what they’re doing, and that is very 
refreshing.”

Message of the Supervisory Board
Message of the Chairman
The Supervisory Board’s primary focus in 2020 was on 
advising and supporting the Management Board as they 
navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring the 
company continued to work towards its long-term value 
creation strategy.
Impact of COVID-19
The pandemic had a profound impact on Flow Traders in 
2020. The Supervisory Board worked with the Management 
Board as the company launched its business continuity plan, 
which helped ensure investors were provided with 
uninterrupted market coverage and access to liquidity. 
In March, the markets experienced exceptional volatility. 
While this created a particularly busy period for everyone in 
the company, they handled the situation professionally and 
skillfully. The Supervisory Board was proud of the efforts 
made by our people, many of whom were working from new 
locations or from home. 
The Supervisory Board in 2020
During 2020 the Supervisory Board held one face-to-face 
meeting only, with the rest taking place via video 
conferencing. This worked smoothly. 
Throughout the year, the Supervisory Board discussed a wide 
range of topics, from the company’s response to the 
pandemic, the ﬁ nancial results, technology investments to 
support diversiﬁ cation initiatives, additional control 
procedures and cybersecurity, and strategic initiatives. 
The Supervisory Board also increased its contact with 
shareholders’ representatives, ensuring that they were kept 
abreast of company developments. 
The Supervisory Board focused on developments within the 
regulatory environment, including the introduction and 
implementation of the EU Shareholder Rights Directive II, 
and the new European Union IFR/IFD regulations, which will 
come into force in June 2021.

Looking ahead
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2021, the Supervisory 
Board will continue to follow the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the company and the broader market, while 
planning for post-pandemic developments. Other key focus 
areas will be the further development of the company’s FX 
business, and expansion into other asset classes or 
territories. Finally, the Supervisory Board will continue to 
help develop Flow Traders’ ESG story and propositions. 
The Supervisory Board ﬁ rmly believes that Flow Traders has 
a strong ESG proposition, particularly when considered in 
light of the highly material ESG priorities. The provision of 
liquidity to the ﬁ nancial markets has been a key focus of the 
Supervisory Board for many years and has underpinned the 
diversiﬁ cation strategy. The Supervisory Board has also 
fostered a robust governance culture to ensure the 
company operates with utmost business integrity. 
The recent re-emphasis of the company’s culture by the 
Supervisory Board is an essential component of ensuring the 
offering of sustainable employment. This will be done by 
ensuring the company’s public ESG disclosure is 
continuously improved as well as monitoring the expansion 
and development Flow Traders’ capabilities in trading ESG 
related products.
The Supervisory Board would like to thank everyone within 
the company for their exceptional efforts and ﬂ exibility 
throughout 2020. 
Regards, 
Eric Drok
Chairman of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board also held meetings through its four 
committees: The Audit committee, Remuneration and 
Appointment committee, Trading and Technology 
committee, and the Risk committee.
During the year the Supervisory Board discussed steps the 
company is taking to strengthen its environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) criteria. These include clarifying the 
company’s purpose, mission and goals, and enhancing its 
stakeholder dialogue. The Supervisory Board believes that 
improved ESG propositions will improve the company’s 
relationship with stakeholders and lead to greater 
transparency. 
Another important discussion topic was succession planning. 
This year the company welcomed Britta Achmann as 
a member of the Management Board and Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer. 
And Han Sikkens chose not to stand for reappointment as 
member of the Supervisory Board at the 2020 AGM, having 
been a Supervisory Board member since 2015. 
The Supervisory Board would like to thank Han for his 
signiﬁ cant and highly valuable contribution over the years. 
The Supervisory Board also carried out a self-assessment in 
2020. From this, it arrived at three key conclusions. First, 
given the importance of the company’s culture to its identity 
and success, going forward, a separate chapter on culture 
should be included in the Annual Report. Second, 
the Supervisory Board should spend more time, and have 
more in-depth discussions, on strategy developments, 
including M&A strategy. And third, the Supervisory Board will 
increase the frequency of its regulatory and governance 
related training.

Supervisory Board 
discussed steps the 
company is taking 
to strengthen its 
environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) 
criteria”

Supervisory Board report
Meetings of the Supervisory Board 
In 2020 the Supervisory Board members met 14 times to 
hold formal Supervisory Board meetings and met several 
times without holding a formal meeting. Examples of 
meetings without holding a formal meeting include 
a preparation session for the AGM, education and strategy 
days and the self-assessment day. During these meetings 
a number of topics, including the following, were discussed:
 
◾
The company’s strategy including the business 
continuity plan
The Management Board focuses on the long-term 
value creation of the company and has involved the 
Supervisory Board in translating this long-term value 
creation into the company’s strategy. The Supervisory 
Board regularly discusses the strategy, 
the implementation of the strategy, and any associated 
risks. During the year, starting in March 2020, 
the Supervisory Board and the Management Board 
together discussed the business continuity plan, 
following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Additional meetings were held to closely monitor the 
roll-out of the business continuity plan and to keep the 
members of the Supervisory Board updated to the 
rapidly changing environment. In August 2020, 
the Management Board and Supervisory Board 
comprehensively discussed the company’s strategy and 
related long-term value creation. This strategy session, 
amongst other sessions, was held virtually, making sure 
to limit travel movements of the participants as much 
as possible. The Supervisory Board agreed on ﬁ nancial 
and non-ﬁ nancial KPIs of the Management Board, 
these KPIs are further explained in the chapter Our 
governance.
 
◾
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the company’s risk assessment processes 
and the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems remain a priority and 
joint responsibility of the Supervisory Board and all 
committees. The assessment comprises an overview of 
all relevant risks the company is exposed to, 
the internal controls in place to address these risks, 
and the Management Board’s views on such risks. 
 
◾
Succession planning and diversity
The term of Han Sikkens, as Supervisory Board member, 
expired in 2020. Han chose not to opt for 
reappointment during the 2020 AGM. The term of one 
Supervisory Board member will expire in 2021, hence 
succession planning of the Supervisory Board formed 
an important topic of discussion during the Supervisory 
Board and Remuneration & Appointment Committee 
meetings. Following the transition from three 
Management Board members to four Management 
Board members during 2020, the succession planning 
of the Management Board was also discussed. 
When discussing succession planning, the company’s 
Equal Opportunity Policy is always taken into account.
 
◾
Culture and core values
Culture has always and continues to form a very 
important role within Flow Traders, especially with most 
employees working from home during 2020 as a result 
of COVID-19. Culture and the company’s core values 
have been regularly discussed during the Remuneration 
& Appointment Committee meetings and the 
Supervisory Board meetings. The Whistleblower Policy 
and the company’s Code of Conduct and the awareness 
of employees thereof have been discussed on several 
occasions during the year.
 
◾
New legislation and regulation
The Supervisory Board was regularly updated and 
discussed upcoming regulation and implementation of 
new regulation. This includes the revision of the 
European capital and remuneration requirements set 
out in the EU Investment Firm Regulation and EU 
Investment Firm Directive and the implementation of 
the Shareholders Rights Directive II. During the 
Supervisory Board meetings, there were regular 
updates on speciﬁ c projects and the company’s 
regulatory capital requirements under CRR and other 
prime broker capital requirements.
 
◾
Financial results
The Supervisory Board was updated on the company’s 
ﬁ nancial, legal and compliance risks through the Audit 
Committee and the Risk Committee. Other topics 
discussed were the annual, half-yearly and quarterly 
results.
 
◾
The company’s governance structure and related 
documentation
Each year the Supervisory Board assesses all of the 
company’s policies, By-Laws and Terms of Reference of 
each of the committees. In 2020 the By-Laws of the 
Supervisory Board and the Management Board were 
reviewed, amended and re-adopted as well as the 
Terms of Reference of the Remuneration and 
Appointment Committee. The terms of reference of the 
Audit, Risk and Trading & Technology Committee were

the independence of the board members Olivier Bisserier, 
Rudolf Ferscha and Eric Drok. Roger Hodenius and Jan van 
Kuijk were considered non-independent Supervisory Board 
members. For additional information, please refer to the 
chapter Our governance. 
Evaluation of the Management Board 
The performance of the CEO is discussed at least two times 
a year with two Supervisory Board members. 
The performance of the CRO, CTrO and the CTO are 
discussed at least twice a year between a Supervisory Board 
member and the CEO. During performance discussions, 
the representatives speak with the Management Board 
members individually and with the Management Board as 
a whole. Guiding structures for these conversations include 
the Management Board KPI overview, the strategic project 
goals set for 2020, Flow Traders’ culture and overall team 
performance. Based on these discussions the Remuneration 
& Appointment Committee provides feedback regarding its 
view on the Management Board’s performance to the 
Supervisory Board, to guide year-end discussions as well as 
deliberations on variable rewards.
Evaluation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of the 
self-assessment of 2019, and the follow-up on conclusions 
of that self-assessment. As a result of the conclusions of 
the assessment, the Supervisory Board continued the 
initiative launched in 2018 to host a dedicated Strategy Day, 
even though the set-up has changed during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Additionally, the Supervisory Board ensured 
a clear link between the company KPI’s and its strategy. 
In 2020 the Supervisory Board also reviewed its own 
performance using a combination of an electronic survey 
and a group discussion. Compared to 2019, the Supervisory 
Board concluded that it has continued to function well. 
Speciﬁ c items for follow up that arose this year included 
continued focus on strategy, the composition of the 
Supervisory Board and ensuring in-depth knowledge of the 
business of Flow Traders and its regulatory environment. 
The Supervisory Board’s self-assessment includes an 
independence-assessment. The independence assessment 
in 2020 was led by Eric Drok as independent Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board and Rudolf Ferscha as independent 
Chairman of the Remuneration & Appointment Committee. 
Following the assessment, the Supervisory Board conﬁ rmed 
amended and re-adopted in 2019. In 2019, a new related 
party transaction policy was adopted.
 
◾
Industry-related updates
Relevant updates and educations sessions were 
provided by the heads of speciﬁ c departments and 
external advisors. This included updates and education 
sessions about cybersecurity and new asset classes. 
 
◾
Large investments
The Management Board explained and discussed any 
large investments with the Supervisory Board. 
 
◾
Remuneration and variable compensation of 
Management Board and employees
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee updated

members were (re)appointed during 2020. The ﬁ gure in the 
middle column shows the terms of (re)appointment for all 
Supervisory Board members.
Independence of the Supervisory Board
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is not a former 
member of the company’s Management Board and is 
independent within the meaning of best practice provision 
2.1.8 of the Corporate Governance Code. Supervisory Board 
members Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they, as founders of Flow Traders, 
are former members of the company’s Management Board 
and represent shareholders of the company. 
Committees
The Supervisory Board has four committees: the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, 
the Trading & Technology Committee, and the Risk 
Committee. Each committee has a preparatory and/or 
advisory role to the Supervisory Board and reports to the 
Supervisory Board accordingly. The Chairmen of the Audit 
Committee, Remuneration & Appointment Committee and 
the Risk Committee all qualify as independent under the 
provisions of the Corporate Governance Code. The Trading & 
Technology Committee and the Risk Committee were 
established to cater for the monitoring of and advising on 
speciﬁ c business related topics and reﬂ ect our business 
model of focusing on pricing, cutting-edge technology 
platform and risk management. The Trading & Technology 
Committee is chaired by one of the founders and former 
Management Board members of the company. For more 
information on the responsibilities of our committees, 
please refer to the chapter Our governance.
When it comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, we adhere to the same principles of 
equal opportunity as set out above. As a result, our current 
Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
education, nationality, and professional backgrounds. 
Our Equal Opportunity Policy can be found on our website 
www.ﬂ owtraders.com.
Succession planning
Until 24 June 2020, the Management Board consisted of 
three members. Starting on 24 June 2020, the Management 
Board consisted of four members. During the AGM held on 
24 June 2020, shareholders voted in favor of the 
appointment of Britta Achmann as member of the 
Management Board and Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer of the company. 
The full size and composition of the Management Board was 
discussed regularly during 2020. Our Equal Opportunity 
Policy was an important topic during these discussions. 
Han Sikkens chose not to opt for reappointment after the 
Profile of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board Proﬁ le provides that the 
qualiﬁ cations of a particular candidate and ﬁ t with the 
company’s needs shall always prevail when ﬁ lling a position. 
When selecting members, the Supervisory Board aims for 
overall balance in nationality, gender, age, experience, 
and executive and non-executive backgrounds. In addition, 
balance in the experience and afﬁ nity with the nature and 
culture of the business of the company will be sought. 
The Supervisory Board strives to realize a diverse 
composition in the nomination and appointment process for 
vacancies, while taking into account the overall proﬁ le and 
selection criteria for appointments of suitable candidates to 
the Supervisory Board. As such, diversity, including gender-
related, is an important consideration in the selection 
process for the (re)appointment of Supervisory Board 
members. The Supervisory Board Proﬁ le can be found on 
our website: www.ﬂ owtraders.com.
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
The company has an Equal Opportunity Policy in place. 
In this policy we explain our objective to treat everyone 
equally during the hiring process and throughout their 
careers at Flow Traders. We are committed to being a truly 
equal opportunity employer, by recruiting, retaining and 
promoting people based on merit, and merit alone. We are 
a ﬁ rm believer in the beneﬁ ts of a diverse workplace and we 
do not make any concessions to quality. Our objective is to 
provide equal employment opportunities to all qualiﬁ ed job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all of our 
employees, provided they perform highly. When positions 
become available, we actively encourage all candidates to 
apply and ensure that the selection and retention processes 
are truly equal for all applicants and employees. This also 
holds for our Management Board and Supervisory Board.

During these meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the 
annual results, the half-yearly results and the quarterly 
results and shared the items discussed with the Supervisory 
Board. The Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce departments have been 
discussed extensively, following the appointment of Britta 
Achmann as CRO. Other topics discussed included the 
Management Board’s methods for the assessment of the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s 
internal risk and control systems, new and proposed 
legislative initiatives related to accounting, auditing and 
ﬁ nancial reporting, tax planning, tax strategy and 
monitoring, the company’s compliance with rules and 
regulations, the company’s Code of Conduct, the company’s 
ﬁ nancing strategy (including the interim dividend proposal) 
and the methods used to assess the effectiveness of the 
internal and external audit processes. The company’s 
external auditor, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP (EY), 
attended all meetings, Topics discussed with the external 
auditor included the ﬁ nancial statements over the ﬁ nancial 
year 2019, recommendations on the basis of the annual 
report, their audit plan for the ﬁ nancial year 2020 and their 
interim review report. The Audit Committee reviewed the 
management letter and recommendations included in the 
auditor’s report, as issued by the external auditor and 
discussed the actions taken by management to address any 
recommendations and observations. The Audit Committee 
evaluates the performance of the external auditor and 
discusses this with the Supervisory Board and subsequently 
with the external auditor. In light of this, the Audit 
Committee advises the Supervisory Board about the 
reappointment of the external auditor, before the 
Supervisory Board determines its nomination for the 
appointment of the external auditor to the General Meeting. 
Given the nature of our business, the application of 
information and communication technology by the 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee met ﬁ ve times in 2020, with each 
meeting fully attended. Other attendees included the CEO, 
the Global Head of Finance, the Interim Global Head of 
Internal Audit, who had a standing invitation to each 
meeting, and the external auditor.
The committees report to the Supervisory Board by sharing 
their advice and recommendations during the Supervisory 
Board meetings and by providing an update of the 
deliberations during the Supervisory Board meetings. Apart 
from a small number of meetings at the start of the year 
which were held at the company’s ofﬁ ces in Amsterdam, 
most of the meetings were held via conference call as 
a result of COVID-19.

of the company’s interim ﬁ nancial statements and issued an 
unqualiﬁ ed review report. The Audit Committee evaluated 
the qualiﬁ cations, performance and independence of EY, 
taking into account the opinions of the Management Board. 
The Audit Committee also obtained a report from the 
external auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. EY conﬁ rmed its independence 
from Flow Traders in accordance with the professional 
standards applicable to it. EY’s lead audit partner was 
present at all Audit Committee meetings held in 2020. 
Based on the information provided by the Audit Committee, 
the Supervisory Board nominated EY as external auditor at 
the company’s General Meeting in 2020. Subsequently, 
EY was reappointed by the General Meeting as external 
auditor for the ﬁ nancial year 2020.
Internal audit function 
The Internal Audit Function (IAF) executed audits that form 
part of the internal audit plan, approved by the Supervisory 
Board. Focus areas in this audit plan included the resilience 
of our trading systems, transparency and IT processes. 
The Audit Committee and the Interim Global Head of 
Internal Audit discussed the audit results (ﬁ ndings, 
observations, recommendations, management feedback 
and follow-up). The Audit Committee maintains regular 
dialogue with the IAF. More information can be found in the 
chapter Our governance.

Financial statements and dividend
The 2020 ﬁ nancial statements were prepared by the 
Management Board. They were discussed both with the 
Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, in attendance 
of EY. The ﬁ nancial statements were audited by EY, 
who issued an unqualiﬁ ed auditor’s report. Reference is 
made to the auditor’s report on page 147 of the ﬁ nancial 
statements. The Supervisory Board approved the ﬁ nancial 
statements as audited by EY, including the company’s 
dividend proposal. We invite the General Meeting to:
 
◾
adopt the ﬁ nancial statements for 2020;
 
◾

Management Board and approved by the Supervisory 
Board; and
 
◾

review.
Information on the remuneration of the Management Board 
members can be found in the chapter Remuneration.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met four times in 2020, with each 
meeting fully attended. Invitees of the meeting were the 
Management Board members, including the newly 
appointed CRO, and relevant others. The main focus in the 
meetings was the Management Board’s risk assessment. 
The attendees discussed in detail the relevant risks the 
company is exposed to, the internal controls in place to 
address these risks, the Management Board’s views on such 
risks, as well as the effectiveness of the design and 
operation of the internal risk management and control 
system. The committee has discussed the way material risks 
and uncertainties have been analyzed and discussed,

activated back-up trading locations in Amsterdam, New York 
and Hong Kong. Lastly, we have continued to selectively hire 
throughout 2020 as we seek to progress our growth 
strategy.
Remuneration in 2020
2020 has been a year of extremes in many ways, but ﬁ rst 
and foremost a human tragedy of unprecedented global 
scale. In such a year, executive remuneration needs to show 
restraint and must not fall out of alignment with the current 
societal context. We, therefore, strongly believe that it 
makes sense to moderate variable remuneration outcomes 
for the Management Board and accelerate our contributions 
to society, even though we had a record year and we 
strongly believe in aligning variable remuneration directly to 
company performance.
As promised at our 2020 AGM, the Supervisory Board, 
in close consultation with, and supported by, 
the Management Board has decided to halve the maximum 
available variable remuneration pool over 2020 for the 
Management Board (decreasing the maximum allocation 
from the pool from 5.25% to 2.625% of operational proﬁ t). 
Moreover, Flow Traders has donated a sum equivalent to 
half of the Management Board’s variable remuneration pool 
to the newly established Flow Traders Foundation, which 
seeks to promote and fund health and well-being charities 
globally on a signiﬁ cant, structured and annually recurring 
basis.
We have given the individual variable remuneration awards 
to the members of the Management Board extensive 
consideration. Despite us halving the available remuneration 
leading global ETP trading footprint, Flow Traders total 
value traded in 2020 grew to €5.2 trillion (2019: €4.0 trillion), 
of which €1.5 trillion (2019: €1.0 trillion) was traded in ETPs 
(on-exchange and off-exchange). 
The market environment experienced in 2020 along with 
Flow Traders’ own pricing, hedging and risk management 
capabilities translated into Net Trading Income (NTI) of €933 
million (2019: €216 million) - a record year for Flow Traders 
by some distance. We saw clear outperformance in all 
regions and across all asset classes as the levels of market 
activity were broad based in nature. On the cost side, 
we maintained a ﬁ rm discipline on costs with ﬁ xed operating 
expenses amounting to €118.7 million in 2020 (2019: €99.8 
million), which is within the guided ﬁ xed cost growth rate of 
maximum 10 percent for 2020 (excluding one-off 
expenses). The main drivers of the increase in ﬁ xed 
expenses were technology investments to support 
diversiﬁ cation initiatives and efﬁ ciency improvements as 
well as new hires. FTEs increased by 8 percent to 554. 
Variable employee expenses have increased to €228.1 
million (2019: €37.7 million) which reﬂ ects the improved 
overall ﬁ nancial performance of the business during the 
year. Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
demonstrated strong operational leverage with an EBITDA 
margin of 63% in 2020 (2019: 36%) and EBITDA of €586.6 
million (2019: €78.9 million). 
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an 
even greater focus on our people. We successfully activated 
the business continuity plan with the primary focus being 
the health and well-being of our employees and their 
families. Employees have adapted well to the changing 
working environment with the vast majority now working 
from home. Moreover, we have split teams and have 
Letter from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee
Dear shareholders,
On behalf of the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, 
I am pleased to present our 2020 Remuneration Report. 
This report includes a summary of our remuneration policy 
currently in place, as approved at the 2016 AGM, and the 
remuneration paid out in 2020 in accordance with this policy. 
The full remuneration policy is published on our website. 
Furthermore, this report explains how we have taken on 
board stakeholder feedback on our current remuneration 
policy, and a summary of the proposed updates to our policy 
we will submit to the 2021 AGM.
The remuneration report reﬂ ects the reporting 
requirements originating from the updated EU Shareholder 
Rights Directive and the Dutch implementation of this 
Directive. Although the ﬁ nal non-binding EU guidelines for 
disclosure are not published yet, our report is drafted in line 
with the spirit of these draft guidelines. 
A record year against the backdrop 
of a global health crisis
2020 saw signiﬁ cantly heightened levels of overall market 
activity compared to 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic spread 
globally. Volatility peaked in mid-March to early-April as the 
markets absorbed the potential impact of the pandemic 
with the VIX index reaching the 85 point mark in mid-March. 
Following these exceptional market circumstances, markets 
did proceed to normalize for the remainder of 2020, 
although the VIX index remained elevated compared to the 
levels seen in 2019. Given this market backdrop and our

make a loss in upcoming years, any outstanding 
deferred variable compensation from previous years 
would be forfeited and used to cover this loss. 
 
◾
We share our proﬁ ts fairly with our shareholders and 
employees. Although individual award levels to 
members of the Management Board may be considered 
substantial, all other employees also beneﬁ t 
substantially from participation in the variable 
remuneration pool.
Activities of the Committee in 2020
In 2020, we put forward for AGM approval our revised 
remuneration policies for both the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board (binding vote) and our ﬁ rst remuneration 
report under the new EU Shareholder Rights Directive 
Requirements (advisory vote). The shareholders adopted the 
new policy for the Supervisory Board and the remuneration 
report. The revised policy for the Management Board 
reached an approval rate of 58.70% and did not obtain the 
75% majority vote during the AGM, therefore we continued 
to operate under the Remuneration Policy as approved in 
2016. 
Stakeholder engagement
We take our stakeholder’s views very seriously and welcome 
an open dialogue with them on a regular basis on all aspects 
of remuneration. Based on the feedback received from 
investors and shareholders around our 2020 AGM, 
we engaged in a comprehensive consultation with various 
stakeholders regarding the current remuneration policy. 
We have also asked current members of the Management 
Board for their views, in line with the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code.
pool for the Management Board, the variable remuneration 
components for the members of the Management Board 
are substantial. These awards of course follow our 
remuneration philosophy and are in accordance with our 
existing remuneration policy. This is a long-standing 
remuneration philosophy which we have operated since 
inception and that provides a relatively modest base salary, 
no beneﬁ ts and a proﬁ t share that directly reﬂ ects company 
performance - therefore varying considerably between 
successful and less successful (ﬁ nancial) years. 
Also considering the size of the variable remuneration 
awards, we believe it is important to align the awards with 
longer-term value creation and the shareholder experience. 
As such we have decided to follow the principles of our 2021 
proposed remuneration policy and to defer a majority of 
each award for a multi-year period and to pay-out 50% of 
each award in share-like instruments (instead of a 100% 
cash pay-out in at least two installments). At vesting, 
the share-like instruments will be paid-out in cash, whereby 
the value of the instruments is directly linked to Flow 
Traders’ share price development between moment of 
award and moment of vesting. 
In addition, we feel it is important to highlight a number of 
balancing elements:
 
◾
We believe in rewarding for exceptional performance. 
Consequently, in exceptional years our pay-mix is 
heavily skewed towards variable remuneration. If Flow 
Traders is less successful, there is a corresponding 
downwards impact on variable remuneration levels 
without any smoothing actions.
 
◾
At the same time, we defer part of the variable 
remuneration granted, and this deferred remuneration 
remains at risk until vesting. If Flow Traders were to 
The dialogue with these stakeholders was very constructive 
and better understanding their views on our Management 
Board compensation has been very valuable. The insights 
have signiﬁ cantly contributed to the design of the 
remuneration policy we intend to propose to our 
shareholders at the 2021 AGM. We summarize the main 
feedback provided regarding the Management Board 
remuneration policy, and how we have acted upon this 
feedback in the table below.

COVID-19 pandemic, 
there has been an 
even greater focus on

Main feedback from stakeholders
How we have acted upon this feedback
The policy appears to have a short-term focus
 
◾
Long-term value creation and share ownership are cornerstones of our remuneration philosophy. We propose to further align 
our remuneration policy with our philosophy and to defer a majority of any variable remuneration award for a multi-year 
period. It is proposed that a signiﬁ cant part (50%) of the variable remuneration is paid out in equity-linked instruments and 
subject to a holding period of one year after vesting.
 
◾
In addition to already operating above market standards clawback provisions, we propose to update our remuneration policy 
and introduce post-termination transfer restrictions.
 
◾
We propose to update our remuneration policy and encourage our Management Board members to retain 50% of any shares 
granted as part of remuneration (after tax) until end of employment.
 
◾
We have restructured our remuneration report, with the aim to better explain the design of our remuneration policy and in 
particular the working of our variable remuneration plan.
Management Board variable remuneration is uncapped
 
◾
It is in our corporate DNA to share our proﬁ ts fairly with our shareholders and employees, and we have done so since we were 
founded. We propose to update our remuneration policy and introduce a hard cap on Management Board individual total 
remuneration levels with such cap to be determined annually by taking into account the average full time employee total 
remuneration levels.
 
◾
We have restructured our remuneration report, with the aim to better explain the design of our remuneration policy and in 
particular the working of our variable remuneration plan.
Transparency and disclosure on pay-for-performance 
can be improved
 
◾
We have included more details on the working, dynamics, key performance indicators and performance outcomes of the 
Management Board member’s individual KPIs.
 
◾
We have restructured our remuneration report, with the aim to better explain the working of our variable compensation plan.
On behalf of the Committee, I thank all shareholders for the 
constructive feedback and am looking forward to continuing 
our dialogue.

the organisation.
Our remuneration principles
We believe in sharing our proﬁ ts with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and ofﬁ ce are 
entitled to receive variable compensation relative to their 
contribution to the ﬁ rm as a whole. We are transparent 
about how we pay our people and how much we pay them, 
including management. We have a straightforward 
remuneration policy that permits variable remuneration 
only when a proﬁ t is made. And because variable 
remuneration is, to a large extent, deferred, it remains at risk 
of forfeiture if we sustain a loss. We believe this is the 
strongest incentive for sustainable, risk-aware behavior for 
all our staff. 
Flow Traders’ approach to remuneration 
Our Management Board remuneration policy aims to attract, 
motivate and retain Management Board members to lead 
Flow Traders and sustainably execute Flow Traders’ strategy. 
The remuneration policy reﬂ ects of our mission, corporate 
identity and values. The remuneration policy fosters our 
unique Flow Traders culture.
Our mission and corporate identity
We are a leading global-technology enabled liquidity 
provider, specialized in Exchange Traded Products. 
As a technology company operating in a ﬁ nancial 
environment, we focus on providing liquidity in ﬁ nancial 
products both on- and off-exchange. As a result, market 
participants beneﬁ t from higher execution quality and lower 
overall trading costs, while the markets beneﬁ t from greater 
efﬁ ciency and more transparency. The liquidity we provide in 
volatile markets helps ensure that ﬁ nancial markets keep 
functioning under all circumstances. Flow Traders helps 
absorb market shocks by absorbing a sudden surge in 
trading which helps stabilize markets, ensures accurate 
pricing and reduces volatility.
We are an ambitious, international company, with an 
increasing role in the ﬁ nancial ecosystem in the world’s 
largest ﬁ nancial markets. We operate in a fast moving, 
complex and highly competitive environment, at the 
intersection of trading, ﬁ nancial services and technology. 
As only the very best companies in this market will survive, 
we aim to attract and retain the very best people at every 
level in the organisation. 
Application of our remuneration principles
At Flow Traders, we provide our members of the 
Management Board a remuneration package that consists of 
ﬁ xed remuneration, in the form of base salary, and variable 
remuneration:
 
◾
The long-standing foundation of our policy is a 
relatively modest base salary and variable 
remuneration that is aligned with company 
performance – therefore varying considerably in 
successful and less successful (ﬁ nancial) years.
 
◾
The design of our remuneration policy reﬂ ects our 
mission, corporate identity, core values & culture, 
is aligned with our long-term interests and is 
underpinned by deep risk-awareness.

These principles are also reﬂ ected in our Management Board remuneration policy:
Principle
Application
Sharing
 
◾
Given good performance, employees from any role and ofﬁ ce are entitled to receive variable remuneration relative to their 
contribution to the ﬁ rm as a whole.
 
◾
If we make no proﬁ t, we do not pay-out variable remuneration. 
Operating a single & straightforward policy
 
◾
We reward all our employees, including the Management Board, based on the same remuneration policy.
 
◾
We share one singular ﬁ rm-wide variable remuneration pool.
 
◾
The Management Board does not receive material ancillary beneﬁ ts beyond variable remuneration.
Rewarding for exceptional performance
 
◾
Remuneration consists of a relatively modest base salary and variable remuneration linked directly to performance.
 
◾
The pay-mix is skewed towards variable remuneration in good (ﬁ nancial) years. At the same time, we do not pay-out any 
variable remuneration – and reclaim outstanding deferrals, if we sustain a loss.
Guarding long-term interests & stimulating 
risk awareness
 
◾
We operate an integrated short-term and long-term variable remuneration plan.
 
◾
We defer a signiﬁ cant portion of variable remuneration pay-outs for a multi-year period.
 
◾
If the company incurs a loss, any outstanding deferred variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited entirely to cover 
that loss.
 
◾
Our claw back provisions are comprehensive, irreversible and substantially exceed industry standards and regulatory 
requirements.
These principles guide the Remuneration and Nomination Committee when making decisions on the remuneration policy and its implementation.

Our contribution to society
We are committed to our broader responsibility to 
society over and above our provision of liquidity and 
market making services globally (ensuring global 
markets keep functioning, under all circumstances) and 
are vocal proponents of fair markets and fair taxation. 
With this in mind, we have always steered clear of (re-) 
structuring any of our operations for the objective of tax 
optimization.
We are deeply aware of our responsibilities to society and 
have expanded our avenues for sharing with society 
more broadly, particularly by accelerating contributions 
to the Flow Traders Foundation. Our Foundation seeks to 
promote and fund health and well-being charities 
globally on a signiﬁ cant, structured and annually 
recurring basis. The Flow Traders Foundation will achieve 
this by, but not limited to, providing direct aid, granting 
microcredits, providing information and/or ﬁ nancial 
means. In 2020, our contribution to the Foundation was 
EUR 10 million. This is on top of the EUR 5k contribution 
each employee could make on behalf of Flow Traders to 
their charitable cause of choice.
Policy at a glance
Our global remuneration model reﬂ ects our key principles 
achieved through the practical implementation of the 
current General Remuneration Policy (as approved by the 
General Meeting on 19 May 2016 and published on our 
website, the ‘General Remuneration Policy’), the Dutch Act 
on Remuneration Policy of Financial Undertakings (Wet 
Beloningsbeleid Financiële Ondernemingen, the 
‘Remuneration Act’), and the related laws and regulations in 
a manner that is tailored to the size of our enterprise and the 
way it is organized, as well as the nature, scope and 
complexity of our business activities. 
The table below provides insight into the main elements of 
our existing remuneration policy and those of our proposed 
Management Board remuneration (subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2021 AGM). We have highlighted the main 
changes. The table below provides insight into the main

Proposed policy (subject to 2021 AGM approval)
Rationale for change
Deferral and vesting
 
◾
Above a certain threshold, variable 
remuneration is paid out in at least two 
instalments
 
◾
50% of variable remuneration is paid out in 
equity
 
◾
62.5% of variable remuneration is deferred 
over a multi-year period
 
◾
The cash component of the variable 
remuneration will vest on a pro-rata basis 
over a two-year period, whereby the ﬁ rst

◾
The equity component of the variable 
remuneration will vest over a 4-year period 
on a pro-rata basis, whereby the ﬁ rst tranche 
will vest at date of award
 
◾
All equity awards that vest are subject to a 
holding period of one year
We have further aligned our policy with our guiding 
principles for remuneration
The proposed policy changes put more emphasis on 
the long-term character of our variable remuneration 
plan. The signiﬁ cant deferral in combination with 
a substantial pay-out in equity will lead to further 
alignment of Management Board interests and those 
of our stakeholders
Maximum opportunity
 
◾
The total variable remuneration pool 
available for all employees (including the 
Management Board) is set at a maximum of 
40% of the operating proﬁ t
 
◾
The total variable remuneration pool 
available for all employees (including the 
Management Board) is set at a maximum of 
35% of the operating proﬁ t
 
◾
Total remuneration for any individual 
Management Board member is capped at 20 
times the average employee total 
remuneration
It is in our corporate DNA to share our proﬁ ts fairly 
with our shareholders and employees, and we have 
done so since we were founded. We have now 
reﬂ ected this in our policy by introducing a cap on 
individual total remuneration pay-outs versus the 
average employee

Corporate Governance Code. Half-yearly discussions take 
place between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee for this purpose. 
Key performance indicators are set for each individual 
Management Board member and the Management Board as 
a whole. Signiﬁ cant underperformance or outperformance 
in respect of these KPIs can result in reductions or increases 
of the proﬁ t share that is awarded to a Management Board 
member.
Use of external market data
We monitor market developments to ensure that the 
remuneration package remains competitive. However, as our 
company proﬁ le is unique, and we are operating in a niche 
industry with a remuneration policy that is speciﬁ cally 
tailored to unique dynamics, market comparisons are 
predominantly used as a secondary reference point.
Scenario analyses carried out in respect of variable 
remuneration
The variable remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board is predominantly contingent upon 
a future, unknown, metric: the accrued ﬁ rm-wide variable 
remuneration pool which itself depends on the operating 
result for the given ﬁ nancial year.
Because of the nature of our business activities and the fast 
paced industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable remuneration 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a ﬁ nancial year while 
performing a single, one-off, assessment at the end of the 
year as set out in the best practice provisions of the 
Remuneration for the Management Board
Introduction
The remuneration of, and other agreements with, 
the members of the Management Board are determined by 
the Supervisory Board (following a proposal by the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee). The Supervisory 
Board has assessed the remuneration of our Management 
Board members based on their performance - both 
individual and as a team- and the company performance in 
2020.

Britta Achmann was appointed to the Management Board at the AGM on 24 June 2020 but has been employed by the company since 1 February 2020. Her base salary for 2020 is shown as pro rata for her start date.

 Prior to their appointment into the Management Board, Chief Trading Ofﬁ cer Folkert Joling and Chief Technology Ofﬁ cer Thomas Wolff had participated in the Flow Traders Cash Incentive Plan 2017 (FCIP 2017). Under the FCIP plan rules they were offered the 
opportunity to buy Company shares and receive an annual cash incentive over a ﬁ ve year period. The right to these incentives would have been forfeited due to ceasing to be an employee and becoming a member of the Management Board in April 2018. However, 
special permission has been granted to both Management Board members to remain entitled to the incentive rights under the FCIP plan rules in respect of the shares bought under the FCIP at the time they were an employee of Flow Traders rather than a member of 
the Management Board. As a result, they have both received €8,000 annual cash incentive.

Base salary
Three Management Board members - Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer, Chief Trading Ofﬁ cer and Chief Technology Ofﬁ cer - 
were awarded a gross ﬁ xed base salary of €94,608 over 
2020. The newly appointed Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer receives 
€200,000 annual ﬁ xed salary.
Variable remuneration
The design of our variable remuneration design reﬂ ects our 
remuneration principles. We operate a single incentive plan 
that drives and rewards both annual and long-term 
performance with a signiﬁ cant focus on the long-term 
through the multi-year pay-out mechanism. In addition, 
this year, 50% of each award is paid out in share-like 
instruments. The share-like instruments are not real shares 
(and carry no voting rights), but the value of each share-like 
instrument is directly linked to Flow Traders’ share price. 
In addition, 62.5% of each 2020 variable remuneration is 
deferred over a multi-year period, whereby the cash 
component will vest on a pro-rata basis over a two-year 
period and the share-like instrument component on 
a pro-rata basis over a four-year period. For both the cash 
and the share-like instrument component, the ﬁ rst tranche 
will vest at date of award. 
In line with our guiding principles, the members of the 
Management Board share in the same ﬁ rm-wide variable 
remuneration pool as all other employees. This pool of 
variable remuneration is primarily a function of operating 
results. 
Individual performance assessment
To determine individual variable remuneration awards, 
the Supervisory Board conducts a holistic assessment of the 
performance of each individual Management Board member 
and the Management Board as a whole. In this holistic 
performance assessment, the Supervisory Board takes into 
account performance on individual targets, which includes 
both ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial key performance indicators 
(KPIs). Objectives for these KPIs are set prior to the 
beginning of the year. Objectives are set for each individual 
Management Board member and the Management Board as 
a whole. 
Although performance on the KPIs is an important element 
of the holistic performance assessment, there is no 
formulaic relationship between performance on these KPIs 
and the variable remuneration award. However, signiﬁ cant 
underperformance or outperformance in respect of these 
objectives results in reductions or increases of the proﬁ t 
share that is awarded to a Management Board member.
1. 
 Setting the maximum variable remuneration within 
the limits of the firm-wide variable remuneration 
pool
 
◾As a result of exceptional operating results, 
the ﬁ rm-wide variable remuneration pool for 2020 
was considerably higher than in 2019 (€256.5 million 
in 2020 vs €24.6 million in 2019).
 
◾Consequently, the available variable remuneration 
pool over 2020 for the Management Board was 
determined. As mentioned in the Chair’s letter, 
we have decreased the maximum allocation from the 
pool available for the Management Board from 
5.25% to 2.625% of operational proﬁ t
 
◾The available pool is the key driver of variable 
remuneration and compared to last year, it has meant 
signiﬁ cantly increased levels of Management Board 
variable remuneration in absolute terms (even after 
decreasing the pool size by 50%).
2. 
Individual KPIs
 
◾Individual KPIs were set for the Management Board 
members, tailored to their speciﬁ c role and 
responsibilities. 
 
◾These included amongst others ﬁ nancial KPIs on Net 
Trading Income and product diversiﬁ cation, 
non-ﬁ nancial but quantiﬁ able KPIs on operational 
performance and reaching milestones in further 
strengthening the control framework.
 
3. 
Assessing performance
 
◾Performance was assessed throughout the year by 
monitoring KPIs and discussions with the 
Management Board members themselves and the 
people they work with. 
 
◾Please see the following pages for the KPIs for each 
of the individual Management Board members.
4. 
Determining variable remuneration
 
◾Based on the ﬁ nancial results of the company, 
the resulting size of the pool available for the 
Management Board and the performance of the 
Management Board, both as individuals and as a 
team, the Supervisory Board has decided on this 
year’s variable remuneration.

Comparative overview of company performance and 
remuneration
The long-standing foundation of our policy is a relatively 
modest base salary and variable remuneration that is 
aligned with company performance – therefore varying 
considerably between successful and less successful 
(ﬁ nancial) years. This is clearly illustrated in the table below 
which shows the development of the company performance 
and the average (full-time) remuneration of executives and 
employees since Flow Traders’ IPO in 2015. 
Shares held by employees and 
Management Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, thus aligning 
the company’s long-term success to their personal ﬁ nancial 
circumstances. Since IPO , we have utilized a number of 
share schemes. Around the time of the IPO, our CEO and 
a signiﬁ cant number of current and former employees 
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow Traders 
Cash Incentive Plan (FC IP) and Flow Traders Loyalty 
Incentive Plan (FL IP) were introduced for employees (not 
the Management Board). The FC IP was replaced in 2020 by 
a new share plan for employees which provides the award up 
to 50% of variable remuneration in shares (or share-like 
instruments). On 31 December 2020, out of 559 employees, 
429 employees are active participants of various employee 
share plans.

Remuneration for other employees
Our performance cycle
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the beginning of 
each calendar year, clear objectives are set depending on an 
employee’s role, which are in line with our company 
objectives for the year and our corporate key competencies: 
drive, ownership and teamwork. Performance is reviewed 
throughout the year. 
Individual variable remuneration payable from the collective 
variable compensation pool is dependent on company and 
business unit performance, individual performance and the 
individual’s contribution to the long-term success of the 
company as a whole, discouraging a culture of ‘star’ behavior 
and fostering collaboration and teamwork. Flow Traders 
does not base variable remuneration directly on ﬁ nancial 
results achieved individually. The Supervisory Board 
approves the awarding of variable remuneration.
If awarded, variable remuneration is paid in cash and 
company shares in one, two, three or four annual 
instalments, depending on the amount of variable 
remuneration awarded. The deferred variable component 
acts as a ﬁ rst loss tranche to compensate for any operating 
loss in the subsequent year, acting as a buffer before such 
loss would impact shareholder equity. This serves as an 
important incentive for risk-aware behavior, keeping in mind 
the long-term objectives of the company and alignment 
with our risk appetite. We deem the deferral period 
sufﬁ cient given the company’s risk proﬁ le and horizon. 
 
◾
Variable remuneration components may become 
subject to reduction or claw back if it is determined that 
the relevant employee or member of the Management 
Board did not meet adequate norms of competence 
and appropriate behavior or was responsible for 
behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of the 
company’s position, in accordance with applicable law. 
 
◾
We do not award guaranteed variable remuneration to 
employees unless the guaranteed variable component 
is awarded in relation to hiring new staff, limited to the 
ﬁ rst year of employment, and only if we have a sound 
and strong capital base. 
 
◾
We do not award severance payments if there is a 
serious imputable act or negligence by the employee in 
the fulﬁ lment of his or her function or where an 
employee resigns voluntarily (unless this is the 
consequence of a serious imputable act or negligence 
(ernstig verwijtbaar handelen of nalaten) by the 
company). 
 
◾
The company does not grant its employees any 
personal loans, guarantees or the like as part of their 
compensation package. We do not provide any other 
ancillary beneﬁ ts for any employee. We have not 
reserved or accrued any amounts to cover pension 
claims or retirement claims.
Stimulating share ownership
One of our core values is ownership, and we mean it both in 
terms of mindset and behavior as well as literally. We believe 
that being a shareholder aligns the interests of the company 
with those of our employees. Ever since the company went 
public and before then, we have a history of offering our 
employees the opportunity to become a shareholder. Since 
2017 we promoted shareholding through the Flow Cash 
Incentive Plan (FCIP). For performance year 2020 we have 
started rewarding directly in company shares. 
We are also maintaining our FLIP (Flow Loyalty Incentive 
Plan) program, whereby we award company shares to 
employees marking their two-year anniversary with the 
company. Shares awarded under the FLIP are subject to 
a lock-up period and remain with the employee regardless 
of the termination of his or her employment with Flow 
Traders. All shares awarded to employees, are fully paid out 
from the variable compensation pool. The terms and 
conditions of the employee share plans are subject to review 
by the Management Board annually. As a part of these 
plans, shares have been and will be bought in the market.
Pension
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. At our 
headquarters in Amsterdam, we partner with a pension 
provider, giving employees the freedom of choice to select 
the option that best suits their individual needs while 
incentivizing participation in the company-sponsored 
program. In our other ofﬁ ces we offer schemes that are 
driven by country-speciﬁ c practices and regulations. 
Variable compensation granted
In 2020, the total amount of variable remuneration awarded 
to all employees including members of the Management 
Board was €256.5 million (2019: €24.6 million). 
In 2020, companywide average compensation paid per 
employee was approximately €516,200, while variable 
remuneration amounted to around 85 percent of total 
compensation in 2020. In 2020, 66 employees, including the 
Management Board, were awarded remuneration of 
€1 million or more (2019: nil)

Changes in regulation
Remuneration regulations are subject to change. Currently, 
the European Commission, European Parliament and 
European member states are negotiating implementing 
regulations pertaining to new prudential requirement 
including remuneration requirements for investment ﬁ rms 
(IFR/IFD) which may affect our Dutch trading entity and our 
Group. We expect more certainty about the outcome during 
the course early 2021. We continuously monitor such 
changes but currently cannot assess in full what the exact 
implementation or impact of such changes will be. Changes 
may have a signiﬁ cant impact on the General Remuneration 
Policy, our global remuneration model and other 
remuneration practices of the company and its group 
companies. It may also impact our ability to attract or retain 
talent given the global and highly competitive nature of our 
industry.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1. 
Reporting entity
Flow Traders N.V. (referred to as the ‘Company’) is a public limited liability company (naamloze 
vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its seat (statutaire 
zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, having its registered ofﬁ ce at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 
1018 LL Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Trade Register of the Chamber of 
Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, afdeling Handelsregister) under number 34294936.
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is a leading global technology-enabled liquidity provider 
that specializes in exchange traded products (ETPs). 
 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Group for the annual period ended 31 December 
2020 incorporate ﬁ nancial information of Flow Traders N.V., its subsidiaries and associates. 
The annual ﬁ nancial statements were authorized for issue by the Company’s Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board on 4 March 2021 subject to adoption by the General Meeting 
of shareholders.
2. Going concern 
These ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption.
3. Basis of preparation 
a) 
Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (‘IFRS-EU’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS-EU provides several options in 
accounting principles. The Group’s accounting principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding 
the options available are set out in the section ‘Signiﬁ cant accounting policies’ below.
b) 
Basis of measurement
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except 
for the following items and unless otherwise indicated:
 
◾
ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with changes 
recognized in proﬁ t or loss; 
 
◾
investments measured at fair value through OCI assets are measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment 
losses which are recognized in proﬁ t or loss.
c) 
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are presented in euros, which is also the functional 
currency of the parent company: Flow Traders N.V.. All ﬁ nancial information presented in euros 
has been rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements requires management to form opinions and make 
estimates and assumptions that inﬂ uence the reported value of assets and liabilities and of 
income and expenditure. The actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are constantly assessed. Revisions of estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. For more details, we refer you to 
the chapter on Fair values of ﬁ nancial instruments and to the chapter regarding share based 
payments.
d) 
Principles for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash ﬂ ows
The cash ﬂ ow from operating activities of the consolidated statement of cash ﬂ ows is based on 
the indirect method, the cash ﬂ ow from investing and ﬁ nancing of the consolidated statement 
of cash ﬂ ows is based on the direct method.
The cash ﬂ ows are split into cash ﬂ ows from operations, including trading activities, investment 
activities and ﬁ nancing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash ﬂ ow from operating activities. The Group has elected to classify interest 
received and interest paid (including interest on lease liabilities and interest arising from 
revenue contracts, if there is any) as cash ﬂ ows from operating activities. Investment activities 
are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of ﬁ nancial investments other 
than in the course of operations, as well as acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates,

when the Group holds between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting power of another 
entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized 
initially at cost. 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the Group’s share of the proﬁ t or loss and other 
comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, from the date that signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence 
commences until the date that signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, 
the carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part 
thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair 
value, as are the identiﬁ able net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in proﬁ t or loss immediately. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any gain or loss 
resulting from the fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration is recognized in proﬁ t 
or loss.
b) 
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of the respective 
entities of the Group at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the foreign currency 
difference recognized in proﬁ t or loss. Differences arising on the translation of investments 
property and equipment. Financing activities include the payment of dividend to shareholders, 
the (re)-purchase of shares, the issuance and repayment of ﬁ nancial debt, including ﬁ nancial 
lease liabilities, and capital contributions.
4. Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all periods 
presented in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
General 
a) 
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group entities.
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from 
intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated 
against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee if it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. The ﬁ nancial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date when control ceases. 
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognized in proﬁ t or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.
Investments in associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence, but not control or 
joint control, over its ﬁ nancial and operating activities. Control or signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence follows 
from facts and circumstances, but there is a rebuttable presumption that signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence

Classiﬁ cation
The Group classiﬁ es its ﬁ nancial assets into the following categories: 
 
◾
trading receivables, measured at fair value through proﬁ t and loss;
 
◾
investments measured at fair value through OCI;
 
◾
ﬁ nancial assets held for trading at fair value through proﬁ t or loss; and
 
◾
other ﬁ nancial assets at amortized costs.
The Group classiﬁ es its ﬁ nancial liabilities, other than ﬁ nancial guarantees and loan 
commitments, into the following categories:
 
◾
trading payables, measured at fair value through proﬁ t and loss;
 
◾
ﬁ nancial liabilities held for trading at fair value through proﬁ t or loss;
 
◾
other ﬁ nancial liabilities measured at amortized costs.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group acquires or incurs 
principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of 
a portfolio that is managed together for short-term proﬁ t.
Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value in 
the statement of ﬁ nancial position, with transaction costs recognized in proﬁ t or loss. 
All changes in fair value are recognized as part of net trading income in proﬁ t or loss. 
Trading assets and liabilities are not reclassiﬁ ed subsequent to their initial recognition.
Trading receivables and payables
Such assets are recognized initially at fair value with any directly attributable transaction costs 
recognized in proﬁ t or loss. These items are valued at fair value through proﬁ t or loss on initial 
recognition and changes in fair value recognized in proﬁ t or loss as they arise. 
Investments measured at fair value through OCI
Investments measured at fair value through OCI are non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets. 
Investments measured at fair value through OCI are recognized initially at fair value. 
Transaction costs are recognized in other comprehensive income as part of the change in fair 
value at the next remeasurement and they are never reclassiﬁ ed into proﬁ t or loss.
measured at fair value through OCI are recognized in other comprehensive income unless the 
instrument is impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at 
fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based 
on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. 
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euros at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in 
the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of equity. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of such that control, signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence or joint control is lost, 
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclas-
siﬁ ed to proﬁ t or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
c) 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three 
months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in 
their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
d) 
Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are originated. 
All other ﬁ nancial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of ﬁ nancial assets) 
are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
A ﬁ nancial asset or ﬁ nancial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or minus, for an item 
not at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its 
acquisition or issue.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2020 112
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market 
for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufﬁ cient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a ﬁ nancial instrument at initial recognition is normally the 
transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group 
determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the 
fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or 
liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, 
then the ﬁ nancial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, 
that difference is recognized in proﬁ t or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market 
data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on theoretical prices whereby the price 
differences are recorded through the proﬁ t or loss account. Those theoretical prices can differ 
from quoted market prices. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department monitors whether all 
differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities that are managed by the Group on the basis 
of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price 
that would be received to sell a net long position or paid to transfer a net short position for 
a particular risk exposure. 
Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the 
reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e) 
Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other 
than foreign currency differences on fair value through OCI debt instruments, are recognized in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an 
investment is derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is not reclassiﬁ ed to proﬁ t 
or loss.
Other ﬁ nancial liabilities
Non-derivative ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these ﬁ nancial liabilities are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes 
a ﬁ nancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated 
with its capital contributions to the United States and Singapore subsidiaries. Gains or losses on 
the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI 
while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of 
proﬁ t or loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or 
losses recorded in equity is transferred to the statement of proﬁ t or loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of offset is agreed 
between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS-EU, 
for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading 
activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at 
that date. The fair value of a liability reﬂ ects its non-performance risk.

f) 
Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in proﬁ t or loss over the estimated useful 
lives of each component. The estimated useful life of signiﬁ cant intangible assets is 5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognized and in subsequent years measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of equity-accounted investees is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-
accounted investee as a whole.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
g) 
Impairment
Non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and other debt 
ﬁ nancial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and ﬁ nancial guarantee 
contracts, in this section all referred to as ‘ﬁ nancial instruments’, is based on the credit losses 
expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless 
there has been no signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, 
the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). 
Impairment losses on investments measured at fair value through OCI are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and do not reduce the carrying value of the investment.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the 
recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in proﬁ t or loss, and is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
For other receivables, the Group applies a simpliﬁ ed approach in calculating ECLs as these 
receivables relate to operating activities of the Group. Therefore, the Group does not track 
changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as the difference 
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognized in 
proﬁ t or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic 
beneﬁ ts associated with the expenditure will ﬂ ow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in proﬁ t or loss over 
the estimated useful lives of each component. 
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of signiﬁ cant items of 
property and equipment are as follows:
 
◾
hardware: 5 years;
 
◾
ofﬁ ce ﬁ xtures: 5 years;
 
◾
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date 
and adjusted if appropriate. 
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., 
the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, 
less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeas-
urement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease 
liabilities recognized less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease 
term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Right-of-use assets are recorded in 
property and equipment and intangible assets on the statement of ﬁ nancial position.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2020 114
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no 
impairment loss had been recognized.
h) 
Employee beneﬁ ts
Short-term employee beneﬁ ts
Short-term employee beneﬁ t obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash variable 
compensation or (proﬁ t-sharing) structures if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
i) 
Share based payments
The fair value of equity-settled transactions granted to employees is determined by the fair 
value of the shares at the date when the grant is made. When employees render services as 
consideration for equity instruments, the expense is recognized in employee expenses, 
together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which 
the service conditions are fulﬁ lled (the vesting period). The awards vest in tranches on various 
dates over a total period of three to ﬁ ve years. Vesting is conditional upon the employee being 
actively employed by the Group on the vesting date. If the employee is terminated or resigns, 
any unvested tranches of the award will be forfeited. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reﬂ ects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of proﬁ t or loss for 
a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and 
end of that period. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reﬂ ected within the grant date fair 
value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service 
requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are 
reﬂ ected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless 
there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not 
reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit 
loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors speciﬁ c to the debtors and the economic 
environment. 
The Group considers a ﬁ nancial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a ﬁ nancial asset to be in default when 
internal or external information indicated that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding 
contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the 
Group. A ﬁ nancial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the 
contractual cash ﬂ ows.
Non-ﬁ nancial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-ﬁ nancial assets, other than deferred tax assets, 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and 
indeﬁ nite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is 
recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inﬂ ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inﬂ ows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed 
reﬂ ects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
beneﬁ t from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in proﬁ t or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of 
CGUs are allocated ﬁ rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU 
(group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

l) 
Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net ﬁ nancial expenses 
related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net ﬁ nancial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and are therefore 
directly recognized in the proﬁ t and loss account under trading income.
m) Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized 
in proﬁ t or loss except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items recognized 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to 
tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any 
withholding tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
 
◾
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t or 
loss; 
 
◾
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in the foreseeable future; and
 
◾
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the 
impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. 
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based 
on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and management 
been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisﬁ ed, 
provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisﬁ ed.
The fair value of share appreciation rights (SARs) granted to employees, which are cash-settled, 
is recognized in employee expenses, together with a corresponding increase in other liabilities, 
over the period during which the service conditions are fulﬁ lled (the vesting period). The liability 
is remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any 
changes in fair value recognised in proﬁ t or loss. Estimates used are reassessed at the end of 
each reporting period.
Share based payments have a dilutive effect on earnings per share (refer to note 8). 
j) 
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outﬂ ow of 
economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognized as ﬁ nance cost. 
k) 
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities on the 
statement of ﬁ nancial position measured at the present value of lease payments to be made 
over the lease term. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the 
incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. After the commencement date, 
the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reﬂ ect the accretion of interest and reduced for 
the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if 
there is a change in the lease term or in case of other reassessments or modiﬁ cations. 
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., 
those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do 
not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Assets and liabilities classiﬁ ed as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the 
statement of ﬁ nancial position.
A disposal group qualiﬁ es as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either 
has been disposed of, or is classiﬁ ed as held for sale, and is part of a single coordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
The Group had no assets and liabilities or operations for sale in the reporting and the 
comparative period.
5. Operating segments
The Group operates in the following regions via its subsidiaries and branches in Europe (the 
Netherlands, United Kingdom, Italy and Romania), the Americas (the United States of America) 
and Asia (Singapore and Hong Kong).
The Group’s trading assets and liabilities attributable to each segment are reported to 
management on the basis of net liquidity. Consequently, the reported total assets in each 
segment are net of the segment’s ﬁ nancial liabilities held for trading and trading payables. 
The Group’s capital expenditures include additions to property, equipment and intangible 
assets as set out in notes 19 and 20.
The impact of COVID-19 on the results of the company is discussed in the Our Performance 
section of the Management Board report.
judgement. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause the Group to 
change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities or the collectability of 
tax assets. Such changes will impact tax expense in the period that such a change in estimate is 
made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or 
the tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available against 
which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
n) 
Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognized at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in proﬁ t or loss on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the 
carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in the share premium.
o) 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
The Group classiﬁ es non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classiﬁ ed as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental 
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding ﬁ nance costs 
and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classiﬁ cation is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that signiﬁ cant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sale will be withdrawn. Management must be 
committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year 
from the date of the classiﬁ cation.

exist) for determining the fair value of common, simple ﬁ nancial instruments that use only 
observable market data and require little management judgement and estimation. Observable 
prices or model inputs (including risk-free and benchmark interest rates and credit spreads 
used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, 
equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and correlations) are usually 
available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives and 
simple over-the-counter derivatives. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs 
reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and thus reduces the uncertainty 
associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable market prices and inputs 
varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on speciﬁ c 
events and general conditions in the ﬁ nancial markets.
When the Group measures portfolios of ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in determining appropriate portfolio-level 
adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask 
spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors speciﬁ c to the portfolio. Similarly, 
when the Group measures portfolios of ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, it takes into account any existing 
arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the 
counterparty).
Valuation framework
The Group has a control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. 
This framework includes a Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department which is independent of the Trading 
department and reports directly to the Management Board. The Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce 
department has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading and all 
signiﬁ cant fair value measurements. The daily reconciliation of the positions and prices 
between the prime brokers and the Trading department is most important.
The prime brokers of the Group provide electronic position statements on a daily basis, which 
are uploaded automatically into the Group’s databases. The Group and its prime brokers agreed 
when ﬁ les will be available and methods for transmission and communication. All data is 
normalized by the Group so it can be used in multiple internal systems. The information is 
mainly used for daily independent reconciliation of positions and prices, resulting in proﬁ t and 
loss accounts.
6. New standards and interpretations
All accounting policies are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019.
Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the ﬁ rst time in 2020, but do not have 
an impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Group. 
7. Fair values of financial instruments
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the 
following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in 
determining fair values is disclosed in the notes speciﬁ c to that asset or liability.
Valuation models 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, depending on the 
inputs used for making the measurements.
 
◾
Level 1: inputs that are quoted, unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical 
instruments;
 
◾
Level 2: inputs, other than within Level 1, that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valuated using: 
quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical 
or similar instruments in markets that are considered inactive; or other valuation 
techniques in which all signiﬁ cant inputs are directly or indirectly observable market data; 
 
◾
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the 
valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a signiﬁ cant effect on the 
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valuated based on 
quoted prices for similar instruments for which signiﬁ cant unobservable adjustments or 
assumptions are required to reﬂ ect differences between the instruments.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reﬂ ects the 
price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly 
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date.
The Group uses widely recognized valuation techniques and models (including net present 
value models and comparisons with similar instruments for which market observable prices

For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to determine fair 
value. 
b) 
Investments measured at fair value through OCI
The fair value of Investments measured at fair value through OCI is determined by reference to 
their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation 
technique and are classiﬁ ed as Level 2.
c) 
Other receivables 
The carrying value of other receivables with a maturity of less than one year is assumed to 
approximate their fair values.

The following reconciliations are executed on a daily basis:
 
◾
reconciliation of the positions - The Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department reconciles the 
positions of the Trading department with information provided by the prime brokers. 
All differences are reconciled and agreed by the Trading department of the Group and the 
prime brokers;
 
◾
reconciliation of prices - The Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department reconciles prices as provided 
by the Trading Department with those of the prime brokers and/or data from external data 
vendors. All differences are reconciled and the Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department makes 
sure that any required follow up action is taken, either by the prime broker or the Trading 
department. Therefore, all prices are checked with independent sources.
Results of these reconciliation processes are communicated and agreed with Heads of Trading, 
the Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department and the Management Board on a daily basis.
a) 
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The Group mainly trades on regulated and active markets. The ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities 
held for trading are carried at fair value, based whenever possible on quoted market prices, 
as published by exchanges, market data vendors and prime brokers. 
The valuation of trading positions, both the long and the short positions, is determined by 
reference to last traded prices from similar instruments from the exchanges at the reporting 
date. Such ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities are classiﬁ ed as Level 1.
A substantial part of the ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities held for trading which are carried at fair 
value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted market prices. 
The theoretical prices reﬂ ect price adjustments primarily caused by the fact that the Group 
continuously prices its ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities based on all available information. 
This includes prices for identical and near-identical positions, as well as the prices for securities 
underlying the Group’s positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on 
which the ﬁ nancial asset or liability is traded closes. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce 
department checks the theoretical price independently. As part of its review, it monitors 
whether all price adjustments can be substantiated with market inputs. Consequently, 
such ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities are classiﬁ ed as Level 2.

Hedge of net investments in foreign operations 
Included in ﬁ nancial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2020 was a borrowing of 
USD 136,500,000 which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United 
States and Singapore subsidiaries, which have their functional currencies in USD. This borrowing 
is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign exchange risk on these 
investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to OCI to 
offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the 
net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the USD 
borrowing. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging 
instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise when 
the amount of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the amount of the 
borrowing.
The impact of the hedging instrument recorded in ﬁ nancial liabilities held for trading on the 
statement of ﬁ nancial position is as follows:

The wages and salaries increased in line with the FTE development from 513 as per 
31 December 2019 to 544 as per 31 December 2020. Overall employee expenses increased by 
242% as a result of the increase in variable compensation paid to employees. The increase in 
variable compensation is also reﬂ ected in the increase in other liabilities. The amount of 
variable compensation payable is based on the operational proﬁ t of the company. 
The amounts recognized in proﬁ t and loss during 2020 do not fully reconcile with the 
remuneration report due to the deferred recognition of expenses in future years due to the 
service condition element of the employee share plans.

8. Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on proﬁ t for the year attributable to 
ordinary shareholders and the number of ordinary shares outstanding. 
The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted average effect of 
changes in treasury shares during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the basic earnings per share for the 
effects of all dilutive share-based payments to employees.

2019, company loyalty and sign-on package share plans
Under the 2019, company loyalty and sign-on package share plans, shares are granted as a part 
of variable compensation to certain employees. The shares vest over a period of three to ﬁ ve 
years, depending on the share plan and agreement with the employee, subject to the condition 
that the employee remains employed on the vesting date. 
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date. The weighted average fair 
value of shares granted during the year was €27.26 (2019: €24.02). The exercise price of the 
share option is equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
The following table illustrates the number of shares and movements in share awards during the 
year. The expense recognized during the year was €4,861 thousand (2019: €517 thousand).

2020 share plan
Under the 2020 share plan, shares are granted to employees as part of their variable compen-
sation. The shares vest in four equal installments during the ﬁ rst open period of the year over 
a period of four years subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on the 
vesting date. 
The fair value of the shares is estimated at grant date at €96,318 thousand. Employees are 
granted shares based on a ﬁ xed monetary value. The ﬁ nal number of shares will be determined 
based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the ﬁ rst open period of 2021. 
Therefore, the number of shares included in the table below is based on the ﬁ xed variable

compensation, settled in cash. The SARs vest in equal installments over a period of four years 
subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on the vesting date. The liability 
for the SARs is measured, initially and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the 
fair value of the SARs. The carrying amount of the liability relating to the SARs at 31 December 
2020 was €814 thousand (2019: nil). The fair value of SARs that were vested at 31 December 
2020 was nil (2019: nil).

Borrowings
The Group maintains portfolio ﬁ nancing facilities with its prime brokers to facilitate the trading 
activities (i.e. to ﬁ nance the purchase and settlement of ﬁ nancial instruments). The drawn 
amounts on these facilities continuously ﬂ uctuate based on our trading positions at any given 
moment.
The Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities with ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V. 
(AACB ), totaling € 2,450 million. In addition, the Group entered into interest-bearing credit 
facilities for portfolio margin ﬁ nancing with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BA ML), NatWest 
Markets, Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank and Sova Capital. These facilities 
can be modiﬁ ed or terminated at any time. The facilities are exclusively for the ﬁ nancing of 
positions of the ﬁ nancial instruments traded in the ordinary course of the trading activities 
using the various prime brokers.
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin requirements 
(representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is variable and calculated on a daily 
basis depending on portfolio size and composition) in cash or securities as security for our 
positions held with the relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities the Group is required to comply with 
a net liquidation balance that exceeds the haircut calculated by the prime broker. Both the net 
liquidation balance and haircut are variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on 
portfolio size and composition. The main covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to 
loan size (variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio composition).In 
addition, they require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%, calculated by shareholders 
equity divided by credit limit.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with ﬁ nancial 
statements and other information, including information on our trading activities and trading 
counterparties, and permission to inspect our books and records. Furthermore, they require us 
to maintain all relevant authorizations and memberships required in order to conduct our 
business, and comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and place restrictions on 
mergers and disposition of our assets outside the ordinary course of our business.
Goodwill
In December 2010 the Group obtained control of TradeSense Solutions B.V. and its subsidiary 
Flow Traders Technologies SRL (formerly TradeSense Solutions SRL ), a software development 
company with special focus on trading in electronic markets. The goodwill amounted to € 502 
thousand.
There were no additions or impairments to the goodwill in 2020 and 2019.

26. Other contingent liabilities
Claims
The Group is not involved in any signiﬁ cant and material legal procedures and/or claims and 
there are no other contingent liabilities.
Fiscal unity
The Group constitutes a ﬁ scal unity with its fully owned Dutch subsidiaries for Dutch income tax 
purposes. Moreover, Flow Traders B.V. forms part of a ﬁ scal unity for VAT purposes, covering 
part of the Dutch Group. All companies in the ﬁ scal unity are jointly and severally liable for the 
tax obligations of the ﬁ scal unity.
Cash incentive provided to employees
Up until and including 2019, employees had the possibility to participate in an employee 
incentive plan and are eligible to a cash incentive depending on their share position in the 
company. One of the conditions for this cash incentive is that the employee needs to be 
employed at the company at time of the payment of the cash incentive. Payments will be made 
in the ﬁ rst, second, third, fourth and ﬁ fth year of the plan. Based on IAS 19, costs related to the 
cash incentive may not be recognized until the employee fulﬁ lls the service obligation. 
Therefore these costs will be recognized in future years in proﬁ t and loss. In 2020 the company 
recognized €2.6 million of costs relating to this plan (2019: €3.1 million). The contingent liability 
from this plan is as follows:

General
The members of the Group’s Supervisory Board and the Management Board are considered the 
persons responsible for managing, controlling the Group and supervising the group for the 
Supervisory Board.
Shares acquired by participants in 2015 as part of the EEP 2015 and further set out on page 35 
are subject to a lock-up period. When a participant leaves the Company before the end of the 
lock-up period, the participant must offer any such unreleased shares to the Company at the 
lower of the price paid by the participant or the market price. During 2018, 2019 and 2020 these 
shares were used into the Flow Loyalty Incentive Plan whereby all employees receive 100 
shares in the company at their two years working anniversary. Part of these shares are held by 
the Company as treasury shares.
Treasury shares held by the company are not cancelled. Treasury shares are recognized at cost 
and deducted from equity as part of the retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognized in 
proﬁ t or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. 
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in 
retained earnings. Treasury shares are used to distribute to employees.
Currency translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation 
of the ﬁ nancial statements of foreign operations. This also includes the hedge results.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve comprises the fair value movements on all Investments measured at fair 
value through OCI of the Group.
General distributions
Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the company’s Articles of Association, the Management Board, 
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, has decided that of the proﬁ t for 2020 (totaling 
€464.5 million), an amount of € 172.2 million shall be added to the reserves. The remaining 
amount of € 292.3 million is at the disposal of the General Meeting of Shareholders (General 
Meeting).
Dividends
It is proposed to the General Meeting that a total cash dividend of €6.50 per share will be paid 
out to shareholders for the ﬁ nancial year 2020, subject to a 15% dividend withholding tax. 
An interim cash dividend of €4.00 per share was paid out on 21 August 2020. This means that 
the ﬁ nal cash dividend proposal to the General Meeting of 23 April 2021 is €2.50 per share.

Flow Traders Foundation
As some of Flow Traders’ Supervisory Board members sit on the board of the Flow Traders 
Foundation (“Foundation”), the Foundation is considered a related party. 
During 2020 Flow Traders established the Flow Traders Foundation, a Charity or Foundation 
(“Stichting”) to better structure its historic engagement in giving to others in society who need 
(ﬁ nancial) help. During 2020 Flow Traders has put in place the funding to make sure that 
a signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial basis has been laid so that the Foundation has the ﬁ nancial means to 
make not only an annual but also a structural impact and meets its purpose. The 2020 contri-
bution to the Foundation was for a total value of €10 million and consisted of the following 
items:
i. 
235,000 Flow Traders NV shares, and (total value of €6.0 million already transferred and 
€2.0 million accrued and transferred in February 2021)
ii. 
A cash donation of €500,000, and

unregulated. This risk is mitigated by strict onboarding procedures and limiting the value traded 
on exchange to minimize the maximum risk.
The Group manages credit risk through its Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department that provide 
speciﬁ c guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit risk.
Policies include amongst others:
 
◾
limits for individual product types;
 
◾
limits per counterparty;
 
◾
limits on the duration of the exposure;
 
◾
limits for settlement types;
 
◾
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty exposures are 
monitored on an intra-day basis.
During 2020, the Group observed no signiﬁ cant concentration of credit risks towards single 
counterparties and geographically there was no concentration of credit risk. Based on the 
Group’s counterparty credit risk monitoring, the Group believes that no impairment is necessary 
in respect of trading and other receivables.
Offsetting ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities that:
 
◾
are offset in the Group’s statement of ﬁ nancial position; or
 
◾
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that 
covers similar ﬁ nancial instruments, irrespective of whether they are offset in the 
statement of ﬁ nancial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase 
agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. Similar ﬁ nancial instruments 
include derivatives, sales and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase 
agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, 
such as loans and deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of ﬁ nancial position.
28. Financial risk management
Overview
The Group is exposed to the following risks arising from ﬁ nancial instruments:
 
◾
credit risk;
 
◾
market risk;
 
◾
liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the 
Group’s management of capital.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a ﬁ nancial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the settlement of 
off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each ﬁ nancial asset in the statement of ﬁ nancial position. These amounts 
signiﬁ cantly exceed expected loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes 
into account the likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of 
counterparty default is deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
and the central counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was 
as follows:

5,687
Trading receivables
4,494,361
3,196,439
Other receivables

14,592
Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are guaranteed by the 
central counterparty or clearing house related to that exchange. Members of these clearing 
houses are required to deposit substantial amounts of cash, bonds or equities as collateral for 
any failure to settlement of trading. While still a limited part of our business, there is an 
inherent risk related to transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges as they are generally

brokers. The Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department computes the haircut using internal models 
enabling intra-day monitoring. Limits are set on both capital- and credit usage.
Long and short trading positions include securities and derivatives such as: shares, American 
depositary receipts (ADR s), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRA s), 
exchange-traded products (ETP) and cryptocurrencies. All traded ﬁ nancial instruments are 
liquid instruments. Therefore, the portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame 
and with limited costs.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize the risk for market movements and 
does not engage in long and/or short only positions. The direction of market movements, i.e. 
what the Group considers directional market risk, is not relevant for the Group because of this 
long/short trading strategy. Because of the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and 
settlement risk) of the ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities held for trading are captured in the risk 
and margin requirements which the Group is required to post at its prime brokers and clearing 
ﬁ rms. The consolidated margin and haircut requirements over 2020 is shown in the Capital 
management paragraph. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk close to zero 
remains as a result of inefﬁ ciencies in the models of the prime brokers.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the euro, but also 
United States dollars and Singapore dollars.
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well as net results 
of these foreign operations during the year.
The Group manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the 
statement of ﬁ nancial position. This is because they create a right to offset recognized 
amounts for the parties to the agreement that is enforceable only following an event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties or following other 
predetermined events.
In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net basis or to realize 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can receive and grant 
collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in respect of the following transactions:
 
◾
derivatives;
 
◾
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
 
◾
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities as set 
out in notes 15 and 22 in respect of derivatives (including swaps). Such collateral is subject to 
standard industry terms including, where appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex.
This means that securities received/granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the 
term of the transaction, but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also 
give each party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure to 
post collateral.
Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a ﬁ nancial instrument 
ﬂ uctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, 
volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and equity prices. The Risk and 
Mid-Ofﬁ ce department monitors market risk exposure on a continuous basis (including 
intra-day). Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated risk for the Group, limit 
breaches, if any, will trigger action from the Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department in order to reduce 
the risk.
In addition to the Group’s Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily. The applicable haircut and margins are computed by the Group’s prime

The Group does use ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net 
investments in foreign operations or net results of foreign operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future proﬁ tability of the fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments. The Group 
is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches of arranged interest rates of assets 
and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These 
limits ensure that interest rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and 
hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits.
All ﬁ nancial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair value on 
the balance sheet. All positions carried on the balance sheet are short term and listed on 
exchanges and therefore liquid and tradable.
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility available to 
facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the balance sheet. In order to match the 
liquidity and short holding period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate 
payable, which is ﬂ oating. The Group runs a limited risk on the ﬂ oating interest due to the fact 
that the interest is also embedded in the funding and ﬁ nancing of the long/short positions and 
in the EFP of the future.
Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as the Group’s 
investments in investments measured at fair value through OC I securities. In addition, for its 
option positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk factor. 
Other factors to consider are time and dividend expectations.
The Group manages other price risks by deﬁ ned limits in terms of individual positions per 
product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the size of the exposure, concen-
trations, pricing and valuation parameters and natural hedging between these long and short 
positions.
As the Group is active in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in 
underlying values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and margins are computed 
by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis measures all positions, individual and 
correlated, and reﬂ ects the different risk components. The third party haircut calculation 
conﬁ rms the internal assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is 
exposed to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under Market risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difﬁ culty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its ﬁ nancial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another ﬁ nancial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufﬁ cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. 
The Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime brokers, 
is monitored on a daily basis.

The Group maintains a highly liquid balance sheet, with a large portion of its total assets 
consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable securities and short-term trading receivables 
(arising from securities transactions).
Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the prime brokers 
through uncommitted credit lines and margin ﬁ nancing, as well as cash generated from our 
operating activities. As of 31 December 2020, the Group held € 8.3 million in cash and cash 
equivalents compared to € 5.7 million as of 31 December 2019. These balances are maintained 
primarily to support operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufﬁ cient 
short-term access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.

The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intra-day basis and maintains signiﬁ cant 
portfolio ﬁ nancing facilities with the prime brokers in order to facilitate trading. These facilities 
are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as well as all ﬁ nancial assets in accounts held at the 
respective prime brokers. The Group has no outstanding borrowings other than the portfolio 
ﬁ nancing facilities with prime brokers.
Capital management
The Management Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base well above the required 
margins in order to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁ dence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Management Board monitors the return on its capital as well 
as the level of dividends to its shareholders.

No material subsequent events have occurred since 31 December 2020 that require recognition 
or disclosure in this year’s ﬁ nancial statements.

Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the determination
of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and 
determination of the result for its parent Company ﬁ nancial statements, the Group applies the 
option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the 
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result 
(hereinafter referred to as principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS -EU ﬁ nancial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence, 
are measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated statements chapter 1 to 4 for 
a description of the Group’s IFRS -EU principles.
The proﬁ t from participating interests consists of the Company’s share in the results of these 
participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the transfer of assets and liabilities 
between (i) the Group and its participating interests on (ii) between participating interests 
themselves, are not recognized.

Independent auditor’s report
To: the shareholders and supervisory board of Flow Traders N.V.
Report on the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements 2020 included in the 
annual report
Our opinion
We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements 2020 of Flow Traders N.V., based in Amsterdam 
(referred to as the company). The ﬁ nancial statements comprise the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements and the parent company ﬁ nancial statements.
In our opinion: 
 
◾
the accompanying consolidated ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
ﬁ nancial position of Flow Traders N.V. as at 31 December 2020, and of its result and its cash 
ﬂ ows for 2020 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code 
 
◾
the accompanying parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
ﬁ nancial position of Flow Traders N.V. as at 31 December 2020, and of its result for 2020 in 
accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements comprise:
 
◾
The consolidated statement of ﬁ nancial position as at 31 December 2020 
 
◾
The following statements for 2020: the consolidated statement of proﬁ t or loss and other 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in equity and cash ﬂ ows
 
◾
The notes comprising a summary of the signiﬁ cant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
The parent company ﬁ nancial statements comprise: 
 
◾
The parent company balance sheet as at 31 December 2020
 
◾
The parent company income statement for 2020
 
◾
The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory 
information. 
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on 
Auditing. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities for 
the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements” section of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on speciﬁ c 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht 
accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit ﬁ rms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de 
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant 
independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 
Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Our audit approach
Our understanding of the business
Flow Traders N.V. is a global ﬁ nancial technology-enabled liquidity provider that specializes in 
exchange traded products. The group is structured in components and we tailored our group 
audit approach accordingly. We paid speciﬁ c attention in our audit to a number of areas driven 
by the nature of the group and our risk assessment. 
We started by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud, non-compliance with laws 
and regulations or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks, and to 
obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepre-
sentations, or the override of internal control.

We have: 
 
◾
performed audit procedures ourselves for the component entity Flow Traders B.V.
 
◾
used the work of another (non-EY) audit ﬁ rm for auditing the component entity 
Flow Traders U.S. LLC
 
◾
performed speciﬁ c audit procedures at other component entities
By performing the procedures mentioned above at component level, together with additional 
procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufﬁ cient and appropriate audit 
evidence about the group’s ﬁ nancial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Teaming, use of specialists 
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the 
appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in the 
liquidity providing industry. 
We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, tax positions and -expense, transfer pricing, 
forensics and cryptocurrencies and have made use of our own experts in the areas of 
valuations of trading positions.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and cannot be 
expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to 
obtain reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements, taken as a whole, are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in ﬁ nes, litigation or other consequences 
for the company that may have a material effect on the ﬁ nancial statements.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
In order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the ﬁ nancial statements 
due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of the company and its environment, including the 
company’s internal control relevant to the audit and in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of 
We performed our procedures in connection to the 2020 audit to a greater extent remotely due 
to the Covid-19 measures. This limits our observation and increases the risk of missing certain 
signals. In order to compensate for the limitations related to physical contact and direct 
observation, we performed alternative procedures to obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁ cient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Materiality
Materiality
€28.6 million (2019: €3.3 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of pre-tax income (rounded)
Explanation
We applied pre-tax income as this benchmark is an 
important metric for the users of the ﬁ nancial statements 
of Flow Traders N.V.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our 
opinion are material for the users of the ﬁ nancial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of €1,4 million, which are 
identiﬁ ed during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in 
our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The ﬁ nancial information of this group is 
included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of Flow Traders N.V. 
As we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, 
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and 
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk proﬁ le of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities 
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of ﬁ nancial information 
or speciﬁ c items.
Our group audit mainly focused on signiﬁ cant group entities, being Flow Traders B.V. and 
Flow Traders U.S. LLC based on the relative ﬁ nancial size of these components.

FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2020 149
we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations have been disclosed to us. 
Going concern
We performed the following procedures in order to identify and assess the risks of going 
concern and to conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting. The management board made a speciﬁ c assessment of the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 
months, noting no events or conditions that may cast doubt on the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. We discussed and evaluated the assessment with management 
exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism.
We consider based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁ cant doubt on the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.
General audit procedures
Our audit further included among others:
 
◾
Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identiﬁ ed, and obtaining audit 
evidence that is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
 
◾
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
 
◾
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁ nancial statements, 
including the disclosures
 
◾
Evaluating whether the ﬁ nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
management override of internal control. We do not audit internal control per se for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. 
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors 
(including internal audit, legal, compliance and Risk and Middle Ofﬁ ce) and the supervisory 
board. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with 
respect to ﬁ nancial reporting fraud and misappropriation of assets. In our risk assessment we 
considered the potential impact of management override of controls related to the fair value 
of ﬁ nancial instruments. 
In our process of identifying fraud risks, we considered whether the Covid-19 pandemic gives 
rise to speciﬁ c fraud risk factors.
We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested 
the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks. In addition, 
we performed procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in 
particular relating to important judgment areas and signiﬁ cant accounting estimates as 
disclosed in Note 7 to the ﬁ nancial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and 
address high-risk journal entries. Our audit procedures to address the assessed fraud risks did 
not result in a key audit matter.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We considered the outcome of our 
other audit procedures and evaluated whether any ﬁ ndings were indicative of fraud or 
non-compliance. If so, we reevaluate our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on 
our audit procedures.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations
We assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that 
could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the ﬁ nancial statements from our 
general industry experience, through discussions with the management board, reading minutes, 
inspection of internal audit and compliance (incidents) reports as well as of relevant communi-
cation with regulators, and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, 
account balances or disclosures.
We also inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and 
remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally

Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signif-
icance in our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to 
the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reﬂ ection of all matters 
discussed. 
In comparison with previous year, our key audit matters did not change.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements as 
a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.

Our audit approach
Key observations 
Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for trading 
(note 7 of the financial statements)
Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of ﬁ nancial assets and 
liabilities held for trading is based on internally determined 
theoretical prices, which are also used for quoting purposes. 
As such, valuation can be different than closing prices at 
various stock exchanges or different than prices from 
clearers, for example due to market illiquidity, variety in 
opening hours of the stock exchanges and the use of 
hedging instruments.
The fair values recorded could include estimates which are 
subjective by nature. Therefore, we identiﬁ ed the valuation 
of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities held for trading as 
a signiﬁ cant risk within our audit.
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing 
the appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies 
related to valuation of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities 
according to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 13 “Fair 
Value Measurement”. In addition, we obtained an 
understanding of the valuation process, including veriﬁ -
cations done by the Risk and Mid-Ofﬁ ce department. 
We evaluated the design and implementation of internal 
controls relevant to fair value measurement.
We performed risk-based sample testing on the valuation of 
individual positions by evaluating the internally developed 
prices against market prices from independent sources.
Furthermore, we evaluated the presentation and disclosure 
in the ﬁ nancial statements for compliance and consistency 
with IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 on disclosure requirements for 
ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities held for trading, including the 
fair value hierarchy.
Based on our procedures performed, we consider the fair 
value of the ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities held for trading to 
be reasonable and we consider the related disclosures to be 
adequate and appropriate in accordance with the 
requirements under EU-IFRS.

Risk
Our audit approach
Key observations 
Digital assets transactions and balances 
(“Our Profile”, “Enterprise Risk Management” in the Management board report and note 27 of the Financial Statements)
Flow Traders trades in cryptographically secured digital 
assets (‘cryptocurrencies’). The cryptocurrencies positions 
are recorded as part of ﬁ nancial assets held for trading and 
results recorded as part of trading income. Cryptocurrencies 
are exchangeable directly between two parties through 
decentralized (‘blockchain’) networks that record 
anonymous transaction data. Alternatively, direct trades are 
executed between members of non-regulated crypto-
currency exchanges. Ownership of cryptocurrencies is 
determined by whoever has access to the private key 
required to transact cryptocurrencies between wallets. 
Therefore, we recognize a risk in the existence of the crypto-
currency positions. In addition, a risk of incorrect valuation of 
cryptocurrencies exists given the high volatility and large 
number of different exchanges. We therefore consider the 
existence and valuation of cryptocurrency positions and 
transactions as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing 
the appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies 
related to classiﬁ cation and measurement of cryptocurrency 
positions under IFRS-EU (IFRIC agenda decision, June 2019).
We performed procedures to evaluate the design and 
implementation of procedures related to cryptocurrencies 
by Flow Traders, including reviews performed by the Risk and 
Mid-Ofﬁ ce and the compliance departments in onboarding 
exchanges as well as trading in new cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, we evaluated the design and implementation 
of the daily trades reconciliation controls and procedures for 
deposits and withdrawals with cryptocurrency exchanges. 
Last, by observing the positions at each of the exchanges at 
year-end and subsequently testing on the valuation of 
individual positions by comparing the internally developed 
prices to independent sources, we independently tested the 
valuation and existence of the cryptocurrencies position of 
Flow Traders at 31 December 2020.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any 
material audit ﬁ ndings in relation to the existence or carrying 
values of the cryptocurrency assets.

Report on other information included in the annual report
In addition to the ﬁ nancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report 
contains other information that consists of:
 
◾
the management board report 
 
◾
the supervisory board report
 
◾
the remuneration report
 
◾
Other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
 
◾
Is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements and does not contain material misstatements
 
◾
Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 and Sections 2:135b and 2:145 
subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained 
through our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the 
other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, 
we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 and Section 2:135b sub-Section 7 of the 
Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is 
substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements.
The management board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including 
the Management board report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and 
the other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The management 
board and the supervisory board are responsible for ensuring that the remuneration report is 
drawn up and published in accordance with sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub-section 2 of the 
Dutch Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V. on 19 May 2016, as of 
the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor since that date.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU 
Regulation on speciﬁ c requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.
Description of responsibilities for the ﬁ nancial statements
Responsibilities of the management board and the supervisory board for the financial 
statements 
The management board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, the management board is responsible for such internal control as the 
management board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements, the management board is responsible 
for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the ﬁ nancial 
reporting frameworks mentioned, the management board should prepare the ﬁ nancial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management board either 
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do 
so. The management board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast signiﬁ cant 
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the ﬁ nancial statements. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s ﬁ nancial reporting process.

From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine the key audit 
matters: 
those matters that were of most signiﬁ cance in the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the 
matter is in the public interest.

Ernst & Young Accountants LLP
Signed by: T. de Kuijper
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufﬁ cient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means 
we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂ uence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these ﬁ nancial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identiﬁ ed misstatements on 
our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism 
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements 
and independence requirements. The Our audit approach section above includes an informative 
summary of our responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.
Communication
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and signiﬁ cant audit ﬁ ndings, including any signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also submit an additional 
report to the audit committee of the supervisory board in accordance with Article 11 of the EU 
Regulation on speciﬁ c requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. 
The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this 
auditor’s report.
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
