“In 2024, we proudly celebrated Flow Traders' 20th anniversary, this 
was an incredible milestone for our firm, our people, and our trusted 
partners. This year has been groundbreaking, showcasing the 
strength of our business model, the resilience of our team, and our 
commitment to innovation in global financial markets.
I am immensely proud of what we achieved in 2024. We delivered a 
strong financial performance, seizing emerging market 
opportunities and capitalizing on volatility. Beyond the financials, 
this year marked significant strides in advancing our strategic and 
commercial agenda, including the introduction of our Trading 
Capital Expansion Plan, which is a pivotal step in ensuring Flow 
Traders' long-term growth.
More broadly, we strongly believe we stand at a transformative 
moment in financial markets, operating at the intersection of 
traditional finance (TradFi) and digital asset markets. The shift 
towards a 24/7 trading environment is shaping the global financial 
landscape, and Flow Traders is uniquely positioned to lead this 
evolution. Our leading role in ETP trading, robust distribution 
network, strong pricing capabilities, and position as a first mover in 
digital assets equip us to drive growth. 
Our mission remains clear: to contribute to making global financial 
markets more transparent and efficient, ultimately reducing 
transaction costs, and increasing accessibility for all market 
participants. As digital assets continue to disrupt financial markets, 
we see immense potential for traditional and digital asset 
ecosystems to co-exist, complementing each other to create a more 
inclusive financial ecosystem. 
To our partners and counterparties, thank you for your unwavering 
support and collaboration. Together, we are paving the way for a 
more innovative and inclusive financial system.”

Leadership statement 2024 
Marking 20 years of driving transparency in 
financial markets 
In 2024, Flow Traders proudly celebrated 20 years of 
providing liquidity and contributing to innovation in 
global financial markets. Throughout our 20 years, 
we have consistently demonstrated the ability to 
adapt and thrive in the evolving financial landscape, 
capturing opportunities in emerging asset classes 
and championing the growth and accessibility of 
ETPs. Our efforts have also played a pivotal role in 
fostering greater transparency and efficiency across 
global financial markets. 
This milestone would not have been possible without 
our incredibly talented team, whose passion, 
entrepreneurial spirit, and unwavering commitment 
have been the foundation of our success. Together 
with our trusted ecosystem of partners we have 
cultivated a culture of innovation that continues to 
shape the future of the industry. 
Building upon our strong foundation 
We further focused on delivering into our strategy 
pillar leverage and build-out proprietary 
infrastructure by developing our China proposition 
along with improving our collaboration with partners 
in order to fully leverage our capabilities. 
Throughout the year, as a leadership team, we 
prioritized reinforcing the core of our business by 
further strengthening our risk management and 
compliance framework. One overarching priority was 
to further foster responsible behaviors and our risk 
culture across the firm. 
We believe our culture is a key ingredient to our 
success and it is something we are proud to continue 
to develop, whether through our L&D offering, 
charitable endeavors (Flow Traders Foundation) to 
creating moments to connect, we continually focus 
on team spirit.
2024 trading environment 
Favorable market dynamics allowed us to effectively 
execute our trading strategies and capitalize on 
market volatility driven by macroeconomic shifts, 
geopolitical instability, and sector-specific 
developments.
As a result, Flow Traders delivered its second-best 
financial performance in Company’s history, 
achieving a net trading income of €467.8 million and 
a net profit of €159.5 million. Beyond our strong 
financial results, we successfully met our operational 
and commercial objectives, further solidifying our 
position as a global leader in liquidity provision. We 
also maintained a disciplined approach to managing 
our cost base while enhancing our focus on 
operational efficiencies, ensuring sustainable growth.

Our strategic pillar to optimize core and grow 
trading capital was realized when we announced 
the introduction of our Trading Capital Expansion 
Plan in 2Q, which included the suspension of our 
dividend. Given the success of the Trading Capital 
Expansion Plan thus far, the firm will continue to 
pursue the most strategic debt financing options to 
further support the firm’s growth. 
Following this announcement, we focused on 
fostering investor trust and proactively engaging 
with stakeholders to ensure alignment with our 
growth and diversification strategy. Our expanded 
capital position strengthened our ability to deploy 
trading capital effectively across regions and asset 
classes, enabling us to seize trading opportunities 
throughout the year.
Leadership and expertise expansion  
As part of our commitment and strategic pillar 
technology and innovation, we have been advancing 
our technological capabilities, especially in light of 
the artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and machine 
learning. We took a significant step by appointing 
Owain Lloyd as Chief Technology Officer, he brings 
extensive expertise in emerging technologies, which 
will be instrumental as we navigate the rapidly 
evolving landscape in 2025 and beyond.
As a leadership team and throughout the firm, we 
are deeply committed to nurturing our teams' 
growth and enabling them to achieve exceptional 
results. We actively collaborate with organizations 
such as Women in ETFs, have established our own 
mentoring program, created a dedicated crypto 
talent pool (W3BWAVE), and pursued strategic 
partnerships to develop current and future talent.
2024 dynamics and our role 
The financial markets are undergoing significant 
transformation, driven by trends that enhance 
infrastructure, improve trading systems, and create 
greater transparency and efficiency. 
In 2024, digital assets experienced accelerated 
growth and widespread adoption, with institutional 
interest surging significantly, particularly following 
the early-year launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This 
pivotal milestone served as a catalyst, firmly 
establishing digital assets as a viable and rapidly 
expanding asset class. As a firm, we strengthened 
our presence in the ecosystem by partnering with 
organizations such as Wormhole and Pyth, while also 
expanding our investments through Flow Traders 
Strategic Capital. In 2025, we are also set to launch 
AllUnity’s EUR-denominated regulated stablecoin 
with DWS and Galaxy, which we believe is set to 
further drive adoption, especially across institutions. 
These proof points all support our strategic pillar to 
diversify business model and revenue streams.
ETFs also continued their upward trajectory, 
becoming one of the most influential forces in 
today’s financial markets. With assets under 
management (AuM) surpassing record highs, the rise 
of thematic ETFs, as well as those focused on ESG 
and emerging sectors like digital assets, has 
broadened access to niche investment opportunities. 
As a trading firm with a strong presence in ETFs, we 
are well-positioned to facilitate this growth by 
providing liquidity and enhancing price discovery 
across markets.
Regulation continues to play a key role in shaping 
financial markets. As a participant across multiple 
markets and asset classes, we strongly advocate for 
robust and consistent regulatory frameworks. We 
believe such clarity enhances transparency and 
ultimately benefits end investors. In particular, the 
introduction of MiCAR in Europe and the 
implementation of T+1 settlement cycles highlight 
the importance of proactive collaboration between 
market participants and regulators, a responsibility 
we fully embrace.
The rapid advancements in big data, AI, machine 
learning, and other emerging technologies are set to 
redefine global financial markets. When effectively 
embraced, these innovations have the potential to 
create a more efficient and inclusive investment 
ecosystem for all participants. Recognizing this, we 
are intensifying our efforts to deploy cutting-edge 
technology and quantitative trading insights, 
ensuring we continue to deliver seamless execution 
and value for our stakeholders.
Looking ahead
We see tremendous opportunities for our Company 
and our people as we operate at the exciting 
intersection of TradFi and digital asset markets. We 
firmly believe that greater interaction between these 
ecosystems will make global financial markets more 
inclusive and accessible, benefiting all investors.
As a trading firm active in the digital asset space 
since 2017, we have leveraged our first-mover 
advantage to build a robust and trusted network of 
partners and a global trading infrastructure. This 
strong foundation, combined with our market 
leadership in ETFs, positions us to capitalize on 
emerging opportunities. Moreover, our strong capital 
position and ambitious growth plans motivate us to 
drive innovation and expansion. By fostering 
collaboration across the industry and prioritizing 
transparency, we aim to shape a financial ecosystem. 
that promotes trust, efficiency, and long-term value 
creation for all stakeholders.

provide continuous liquidity as well as actively invest 
and support our partners with our leading 
distribution network and execution capabilities. 
We build and deploy proprietary trading models and 
strategies, enabling us to provide liquidity in a broad 
set of asset classes, regardless of the market 
circumstances. To enable this we continue to 
develop our technology-stack to provide competitive 
pricing and seamless execution.
Furthermore, we actively invest and foster the 
development of market infrastructure to contribute 
to improving transparency and efficiency across 
global financial markets. This is in the form of 
strategic partnerships with both the TradFi as well as 
digital asset partners. 
These activities are executed by our highly skilled 
and talented team who focus on operational 
excellence and create value for our broad set of 
stakeholders.

themes: Environmental footprint, Sustainable 
employment and Good governance.

experienced talent pool that forms a diverse, and 
entrepreneurial team.

How we innovate
Technology is at the core of our business and 
operations, over 40% of our workforce is dedicated to 
this function. Our Technology strategy, focuses on 
prioritizing automation, developing our data-driven 
strategies and enhancing our proprietary 
technology-stack to further improve our execution 
capabilities as well as contribute to the Company’s 
mission.  
Product Development
Our talented Software Engineers leverage the latest 
technologies to maintain and improve our trading 
engines. With a strong focus on code quality and 
maintainability, our Software Developers and Data 
Engineers design and build our propriety code that 
enables us to trade. 
Quantitative Research
Our Quantitative Researchers generate and test new 
trading concepts. As the concept of Quantitative 
Research is becoming increasingly important to our 
business and the industry as a whole, we will focus 
on projects that leverage machine learning and AI to 
further improve our trading strategies over the 
coming years. 
IT
Systems, Network, Security and Trading Support are 
only a few of the focus areas of our IT function. Our IT 
teams deploy and maintain the software and 
hardware infrastructure that supports our day-to-day 
trading activities, which is crucial in enabling us to 
operate effectively. 
Trading 
We focus on technology and niche competencies in 
markets where every second counts, this is especially 
critical with the market shifting further to algorithm-
based trading. This requires access to comprehensive 
data and the ability to convert this data into instant 
and value add actions. To achieve this, our Software 
Developers collaborate with experienced Traders to 
identify and execute opportunities. 
Around 30% of our employee base are part of our 
Trading team, and they drive the development of 
new trading strategies for our on-exchange trading 
activities. Our Trading team are also supported by 
Analysts, who monitor news, prepare for major 
market events, and keep Traders informed on macro, 
micro, and fundamental factors.
Our Institutional Traders support our institutional 
counterparty network by offering prices off-
exchange for institutional counterparties, providing 
competitive quotes-upon-request across RFQ 
platforms. 
Products we trade
As we are classified as an investment firm under 
regulatory standards, we operate solely at our own 
risk and on our own account. In transactions with 
counterparties, we act exclusively as a principal, 
without offering any agency, investment, or ancillary 
services.
Through our ETP trading activities, we provide 
market participants with cost-effective access to 
diverse asset classes. Our liquidity provisioning 
includes equities, fixed income, commodities, FX and 
in 2017, we expanded into digital assets. We trade 
across 180+ exchanges and trading venues; more 
details on our offering can be found on our website.
We also trade with over 2,000 institutional 
counterparties off-exchange, more information on 
our proposition can be found on our website.

markets, we aim to provide tight spreads and 
continuous liquidity, ensuring efficient and 
transparent trading by always providing buy and sell 
quotes across diverse product categories.

Our role in the ETP ecosystem
As a global liquidity provider we operate between both the primary and secondary markets. By providing continuous liquidity, we play a crucial role in ensuring that ETPs 
and other financial instruments can be traded efficiently. This reduces trading costs and improves overall market accessibility for market participants.  
The securities market is accessible to registered participants, including broker-dealers and market makers. Investors place orders with broker-dealers, who route them to 
exchanges or market makers for execution. As a market maker, we provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices, facilitating trades with counterparties. Once a trade is 
confirmed, clearing houses handle the settlement, ensuring secure transfer of assets and payments. Acting as a liquidity provider, we maintain a market-neutral position, 
with performance unaffected by market price direction.

Markets and trends 
ETP investing
In recent years, the ETP ecosystem has continued to 
mature and experienced significant growth in both 
AuM and number of products. According to ETFGI, 
global ETP AuM increased from $11,634 billion at the 
end of 2023 to $14,846 billion at the end of 2024. This 
is a reflection of the underlying market performance 
during 2024 coupled with record inflows into ETPs. 
The market expectation is that AuM will continue to 
grow going forward and we believe there are several 
reasons for this. One is that investors are attracted to 
the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables them 
to clearly follow how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid, 
available at lower costs and can be bought and sold 
easily during market hours. A third reason is that 
ETPs can be composed of financial instruments from 
almost any asset class, sector or location, providing 
investors with access to markets that would normally 
be difficult to reach. 
Global ETP markets grew by 28% in 2024, as 
measured by AuM, driven predominantly by the out 
performance of the underlying markets. Annual 
global inflows of ETP AuM were $1.88 trillion in 2024 
(2023: $985 billion – source ETFGI). Overall trading 
activity in 2024 increased compared to the prior year 
given surprising monetary policy changes by central 
banks around the world, political elections in major 
economies that were expected to have significant 
impact on macroeconomic policies, and the 
resurgence of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. 
Global coverage 
In 2024, Flow Traders’ ETP value traded once again 
was in excess of the €1 trillion mark. The European 
ETP market recorded total ETP value traded of €2,518 
billion in 2024, compared to €2,039 billion in 2023. 
Flow Traders' total ETP value traded in Europe was 
€655 billion in 2024, compared to €619 billion in 2023. 
We remained a leading liquidity provider in ETPs and 
managed to grow our on- and off-exchange trading 
capabilities further. 
The largest ETP market globally remains in the 
Americas, where total ETP value traded (on- and off-
exchange) was €38,545 billion in 2024, compared to 
€35,874 billion in 2023. Flow Traders' ETP value 
traded in the Americas was €776 billion in 2024, 
compared to €754 billion in 2023. Institutional 
trading continued to expand as well and Flow 
Traders Americas continued to grow and deepen its 
overall presence in this important market. We also 
expanded our lead market maker activities during 
2024 and supported numerous ETF listings in the 
U.S. for a variety of leading issuers, including the spot 
Bitcoin ETF launches in the U.S. 
In APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with 
large differences in trading volumes, trading costs, 
regulation and maturity across the financial markets. 
The Asian ETP market recorded total ETP value 
traded of €6,871 billion in 2024, including China, 
compared to €5,168 billion in 2023. Flow Traders' total 
ETP value traded in Asia was €114 billion in 2024, 
compared to €93 billion in 2023. Flow Traders had its 
most successful year ever in Asia in 2024, a clear 
validation of our strategy to invest in the region. 
Our business - operations 
We operate three main trading hubs in Amsterdam, 
Hong Kong, and New York. In addition, we operate 
branch offices in Chicago, Cluj, London, Milan, Paris, 
Shanghai, and Singapore. 
In 2024 we had access to +180 exchanges and 
trading venues, globally. We provided liquidity in 
over 6,500 unique ETP ISINs on- and off-exchange, 
which is more than 40% of all ETPs globally. Off-
exchange, we provided liquidity in ETPs on a RFQ 
basis to more than 2,000 institutional counterparties 
across the globe, including banks, asset managers, 
pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, 
hedge funds, and others, and this number is 
increasing on an almost daily basis. In addition to 
ETPs we provide liquidity in similar instruments 
whose value is correspondingly affected by a change 
in the value of underlying or related assets, such as 
futures or bonds. During 2024, we continued to 
implement our diversification, strategy and related 
initiatives across other asset classes and provided 
liquidity as a market maker in FX, fixed income, 
commodities and digital assets. 
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider 
we generally do not have a directional opinion on the 
market. In other words, our results do not depend on 
the direction of market prices. Our net trading 
income is derived from the small price differences 
that are realized between buying and selling related 
or correlated assets. Whether that is between the 
ETPs we buy or sell, the prices we pay or receive for 
the underlying related financial instruments to 
mitigate our risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager 
and do not have client AuM as we trade from our 
own capital. We also do not develop or make 
products, do not provide any services and do not 
have (consumer) clients. Our value chain comprises, 
among others, of our institutional counterparties, 
prime brokers and regulators.

Asset class developments 
Equity
We still see significant opportunities for growth in 
the equity ETP market. Global equity ETP value 
traded increased to €23,928 billion in 2024, 
compared to €22,718 billion in 2023, and further 
market growth is expected from the increasing 
investor demand and awareness for ETPs. 
Flow Traders' equity value traded (ETPs, futures and 
cash) amounted to €3,217 billion in 2024, compared 
to €3,009 billion in 2023. Our strengths and future 
focus relating to equity includes: 
▪
Strong performance globally in international ETPs 
and index futures 
▪
Leveraging our global pricing capabilities in APAC 
as we penetrate and unlock new growth markets 
Fixed income 
Electronic trading in fixed income has increased 
dramatically over the last few years. For example, 
50% of Euro-denominated investment-grade (IG) 
credit is now executed electronically, reaching 75% 
on a ticket-count basis. This increase has contributed 
to the approaching inflection point in the 
electronification of credit markets. This is similar to 
what we have witnessed in other asset classes, such 
as FX, U.S. equity options and Exchange Traded 
Funds (ETFs). This transition is being driven by better 
pre- and post-trade information, the rise of 
algorithmic trading and new trading protocols being 
embraced by the buy- and sell-side. Initially driven by 
regulation such as MiFID II, it is likely that the 
regulatory landscape will continue to accelerate this 
electronification trend. 
Responding to these market dynamics, Flow Traders 
has built a strong fixed income liquidity provision 
capability set spanning ETPs, corporate credit 
(investment-grade and high yield bonds) and 
emerging market sovereigns. 
There has been a consistent increase in fixed income 
ETP value traded in recent years as well as AuM. The 
global fixed income ETP value traded increased to 
€2,901 trillion in 2024, compared to €2,836 trillion in 
2023. Flow Traders fixed income value traded (ETPs, 
Futures and Cash) amounted to €943 billion in 2024, 
compared to €1,154 billion in 2023, as we shifted 
more of our limited trading capital base to other 
asset classes which saw greater dislocations over the 
year. Nevertheless, we continue to deepen and 
broaden our market coverage and relationships with 
our buy-side counterparties. From a strategic 
standpoint, our focus areas include:
▪
ETP ecosystem: Partner with issuers to develop 
innovative fixed income products. We are also 
seeking creation-redemption synergies with 
corporate bond market making
▪
Credit trading: We will increase quote sizes to 
undertake larger block transactions with 
counterparties as well as distributing pre-trade 
portfolio trading levels to expedite portfolio 
construction
▪
Model pricing: Expand model trading capabilities 
to new fixed income subsets and improve pricing 
and coverage of investment-grade bonds
Currency, cryptocurrency and commodity 
In recent years, cryptocurrencies have emerged as an 
important asset class with increased institutional 
acceptance. Cryptocurrencies saw a resurgence in 
2024 after the last crypto winter in 2022-23, with the 
approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 
2024 paving the way for increased institutional 
adoption. Trading volumes in cryptocurrencies more 
than doubled in 2024 compared to 2023, while global 
crypto ETP value traded increased more than ten-
fold on the back of the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals 
and launches in the U.S. as the development of 
institutional grade and regulated digital asset market 
infrastructure continued to progress. This comes on 
top of continued advancement in custody solutions, 
prime brokerage, data and analytics, AML-KYC and 
other risk solutions, digital property rights, digital 
identity solutions as well as decentralized finance 
ecosystems. 
Flow Traders’ crypto liquidity provision commenced 
more than eight years ago and spans OTC spot as 
well as ETPs. We are connected to over 20 trading 
venues globally and provide liquidity to over 200 
cryptocurrencies. From an ETP perspective, Flow 
Traders is the number one liquidity provider in crypto 
ETPs in Europe and a leader globally on-exchange. 
The digital assets space is well-suited to Flow Traders’ 
technology-enabled capabilities. The future focus 
and opportunities for the digital asset space includes:
▪
ETPs: Maintain our leading position in crypto ETP 
market making with the prospect of further 
regional expansion while at the same time 
working to increase efficiency of access across the 
ecosystem
▪
Spot and derivatives: Continue to grow our 
market making activities across these products by 
expanding our platform and token coverage 
▪
Strategic partnerships: Leverage new and existing 
partnerships to further build out the trading 
infrastructure around digital assets
▪
Utilize Flow Traders Strategic Capital: To further 
integrate Flow Traders into the growing 
ecosystem

Growth catalysts
Transformative megatrends are actively reshaping 
the financial ecosystem in which we operate, 
presenting our Company with new opportunities for 
diversified growth.  
The most prominent trends relevant to our business 
are the global growth of ETPs, electronification, 
digital assets, 24/7 trading and evolving regulation. 
These trends not only shape our market environment 
but also reinforce and amplify each other, creating 
powerful synergies that strengthen our strategies.

Long-term opportunities in digital assets align with our expertise across both TradFi 
and digital asset markets. Increased institutional and retail adoption, along with the 
launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., have driven a 826% growth in ETF AuM 2023 vs. 
2024. Additionally, accelerated growth in stablecoins reflects the sector’s increasing 
strength. The stablecoin market cap is estimated at $189 billion end of 2024, up 53% 
year-on-year.
Regulation 
Enhanced global 
regulations 
As electronic trading advances, it aligns well with our technology expertise. Credit 
algorithms now drive around 50% of Euro credit volumes, especially for trades under €1 
million. Fixed income ETF assets are also set to triple, from $2 trillion in 2023 to $6 
trillion by 2030.
In the EU, the final MiCAR implementation phase is ongoing with early signs of market 
adoption. In U.S., Asia and U.K. regulatory discussions are accelerating. Various 
significant changes to the bond transparency and reporting regimes will take effect in 
2025/26 and will impact the market. The upcoming global transition into T+1 
settlement already impacts ongoing regulatory proposals in the EU. 
AuM reached $14 trillion end of 2024 and is predicted to rise to $25 trillion by 2030, a 
significant acceleration that aligns with our core business growth. In 2024, spot Bitcoin 
ETFs and other cryptocurrency ETFs listed, this demonstrates the further growth 
potential and adoption of this financial instrument.

Our financial performance 
Flow Traders delivered a strong financial 
and trading performance in 2024, driven 
by the introduction of our Trading Capital 
Expansion Plan. We recorded a net trading 
income (NTI) of €467.8 million in 2024 
(2023: €300.3 million). Our cost base and 
capital position remained solid as we 
continued to execute our growth and 
diversification strategy.
Financial overview
Flow Traders recorded an NTI of €467.8 million in 
2024 (vs. €300.3 million in 2023) reflecting the overall 
market and trading environment. Other income of  
€11.5 million was derived from the strategic 
investments portfolio (vs. €3.6 million in 2023).
Europe, our home market, contributed the most to 
our NTI which reflects the region's high level of flow 
visibility, counterparty and product coverage as well 
as the fact that the growth business activities are 
typically located at our headquarter in Amsterdam. 
There were also significant contributions from APAC. 
The disciplined execution of our strategic growth 
agenda meant that investments we have made are 
yielding meaningful returns. 
On the cost side, fixed operating expenses decreased 
to €177.0 million for the year (€180.1 million in 2023). 
The decrease was due to one-off strategic advisory 
costs incurred in 2023, which was partially offset by 
an increase in technology costs and fixed employee 
expenses in support of our trading activities and 
further due to general price inflation.  FTEs were 
slightly lower this year 609 (2023: 613). Variable 
employee expenses increased to €85.3 million (€53.9 
million in 2023) which is in line with the improved 
financial performance of the business during the 
period.
Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
continued to demonstrate solid operational leverage 
with an EBITDA margin of 45.3% in 2024 (2023: 23.0%) 
with EBITDA of €217.1 million (2023: €69.8 million), 
due to the improved performance of the business. 
Profit for the year was €159.5 million (2023: €36.2 
million), with basic EPS of €3.69 (2023: €0.84).
Non-IFRS performance 
Non-IFRS financial measures are disclosed in 
addition to the statement of comprehensive income, 
in order to provide relevant information to better 
understand the underlying business performance of 
our Company. 
In 2024, we decided to simplify our use of non-IFRS 
measures and discontinued the use of normalized 
alternative performance measures to reduce 
complexity in financial reporting and to adhere to 
accounting best practices. 
Flow Traders has the following non-IFRS financial 
measures:
▪
Fixed operating expenses: Calculated as fixed 
employee expenses, technology expenses and 
other expenses. The measure provides a focused 
metric of the core operating expenses of the 
Company while removing the variable employee 
expenses which are dependent on current-year 
results
▪
EBITDA: Calculated as the operating result, before 
depreciation, amortization, and write-offs on 
intangible assets. EBITDA is used as it focuses on 
core trading and operational activities

“By increasing our capital 
base in 2024, we leveraged 
favorable market dynamics, 
delivering a strong financial 
performance. Our expanded 
capital base was deployed 
effectively, resulting in a 
strong return on trading 
capital and enhancing our 
ability to capitalize on 
strategic opportunities.”

Revenue by region: Consists of net trading

Dividend Policy 
Flow Traders may or may not distribute out of the 
Company's net profits realized during the financial 
year to shareholders. The Company's Board may 
decide, in accordance with the Company's Bye-Laws 
and Board Rules, that the profits realized during a 
financial year will fully or partially be appropriated to 
increase and/or form reserves. A distribution of 
dividends is subject to applicable rules and 
regulations, the Company's Bye-Laws and the Board 
Rules. 
If applicable, dividends will be declared and paid 
following the publication of our results. There can be 
no assurance that in any given year a dividend will be 
proposed or declared. 
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts 
and timing thereof, will depend on a number of 
factors, including future profits, financial conditions, 
general economic and business conditions, and 
future prospects and other factors the Board may 
deem relevant, as well as other legal and regulatory 
requirements. Our intentions in relation to dividends 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our 
control.
Reserves for 2024 
In July 2024 the Board announced its Trading Capital 
Expansion Plan and the related revision of its 
Dividend Policy. To expand the trading capital base, 
the Board has suspended regular dividend payments 
until further notice and did not pay an interim cash 
dividend for the financial year 2024. 
Capital requirements
Our prime brokers require the Company to maintain 
certain minimum capital levels. They leverage  
various internal systems to calculate required capital 
amounts (e.g., the ‘internal haircut model’ and the 
‘margin based approach model’, both intending to 
ensure sufficient levels of risk allowances) and have 
different limits structure, pre-funding possibilities. 
Margin requirements of prime brokers are 
conservatively determined by the sophistication of 
their models and the regulatory requirements, which 
might not necessarily be efficient in respect of our 
business model and trading portfolios.
The following table sets out the capital required to be 
posted with our prime brokers and capital available 
(net liquidation value).

somewhat by expected operational efficiency gains.

“Our focus is on developing a 
reliable and robust risk 
management framework to 
effectively manage our risks 
continuously. Additionally, 
fostering a strong risk culture 
is equally important for our 
Company and requires 
ongoing attention.”
Risk management
Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF) forms the foundation 
of our approach to managing risks. The 
ERMF is documented in Flow Traders’ 
Enterprise Risk Management Policy and is 
reviewed on an annual basis.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify 
and document potential risks which are inherent to 
trading in an automated market-making firm. In the 
fast and dynamic environment of automated trading, 
we designed our ERMF in such a way that it is robust, 
efficient and transparent. In the figure below, we 
present the stakeholders that have an interest and 
place value in how our framework operates. 
Our ERMF helps us to ensure that we have adequate 
systems and controls including the management of 
our liquidity and capital. This is delivered through a 
consistent, continuous and careful method for 
addressing, managing and prioritizing our key risks 
in the context of our strategic goals.

Enterprise risk management (ERM)
We aim for a good balance between our business 
activities, return on capital and related risks taken. 
Flow Traders’ ERM approach ensures that our risk 
appetite and profile are integrated into our day-to-
day operations and strategic decision-making. 
Annually, the Board determines the strategic goals 
and subsequent business targets. Based on these 
targets, the Company formulates its risk appetite. 
These targets and risk appetite parameters provide 
direction to our various departments and are used to 
determine our strategic risks. 
Policies and control standards are maintained, 
developed and updated within the ERMF. The 
policies are based on our risk taxonomy and aligned 
with our control setting. To ensure that our daily 
activities remain in line with our risk appetite and 
residual risk we perform yearly Risk Control Self-
Assessments (RCSA) to evaluate current risks and 
identify new risks. We also conduct an annual Risk 
Management Control Cycle to define and test our 
key controls that mitigate our critical, high and 
medium inherent risks in all of our business 
processes to accepted residual risk levels.
Risk categories
Our risk taxonomy is split into five broad risk 
categories - Financial, Business and strategic, 
Compliance and ethical, Operational, and 
Technology - each with their own specific sub-risks:
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

Risk taxonomy 
domain
Level 1 risk 
category
Description of the risk
Financial risk
Capital risk
Capital risk (cost of doing business) refers to the situation where potential 
loss of investment value happens due to factors such as market volatility, 
regulatory and prime broker requirements, economic downturns, or poor 
financial performance of a company. It is the risk of failing to meet 
compulsory capital requirements invested in an asset or investment which 
are needed to maintain a firm’s trading licenses and normal business 
activities and relationships with prime brokers.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refers to the inability to replenish capital to the required level. 
This can happen when: 1) not being able to obtain additional funding in a 
timely manner at a reasonable cost and 2) an inefficient internal 
management on liquidity. This is the risk of not being able to quickly 
convert an investment into cash without experiencing a significant loss in 
value, due to a lack of buyers or sellers in the market, restrictions on 
trading, or the illiquid nature of the asset itself that leads to an inability to 
easily buy or sell an asset without incurring significant costs. It can also 
happen because of a lack of access to alternative sources of funding such 
as short-term loans, trading credit from certain platforms, etc. in a timely 
manner. This is the risk of internal management deficiency which can lead 
to liquidity constraints.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market 
prices; in particular, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and 
equity, cryptocurrency and commodity prices.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in 
trading in or issuing a financial instrument defaulting on an obligation.

Description of the risk
Business and  
strategic risk
Strategy risk
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of a company’s business plan, from strategic changes in the business environment, and/or 
from adverse strategic business decisions. Market activity risk is part of this risk as trading income and profitability are primarily a 
function of the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial instruments traded. 
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or products. Concentration risk 
also includes supplier dependency risks.
Project delivery & 
management risk
The risk of inaccurate project management leading to inadequate realization of strategic project objectives.
Sustainability & 
environment risk
The risk that an environment, social or governance (related) issue or event will impact the entity financially, non-financially and/or 
in the realization of strategic objectives of the entity.
Compliance and 
ethical risk
Fraud risk 
Acts intended to defraud, misappropriate assets, deceive or circumvent regulations or the law, attempted or perpetrated against 
the entity.
Reputation risk
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders.
Financial crime risk
The risk of money laundering, sanctions violations, bribery and corruption, and Know Your Customer (KYC) failure.
Regulatory compliance 
risk
Failure to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations that are not captured through other risks.  
Conduct risk
Failure to act in accordance with internal and external stakeholders and society's best interests, fair market practices, and codes of 
conduct.
Operational risk
Business continuity risk
The risk of failure to provide and maintain appropriate Business Continuity Management (BCM), including inadequate business 
continuity plans.
Trading execution risk
The risk of losses due to errors in the execution.
Legal risk
Legal risk refers to the potential exposure and negative consequences that an individual or organization may face as a result of 
non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and legal obligations.
People risk
The risk that the entity is not able to develop, retain and attract the necessary skills and diverse capabilities in its workforce to 
realize strategic objectives.
Model risk
Model risk for a trading firm refers to the potential for adverse consequences resulting from errors or limitations in the financial 
models and algorithms used for trading and risk management. This risk arises from the reliance on mathematical models and 
computer algorithms to make trading decisions, value financial instruments, and manage risk. Model risk can stem from 
inaccuracies in the models, inappropriate assumptions, data errors, or the failure to account for all relevant market factors.
Reporting risk
The risk of not being able to report adequately to stakeholders (e.g., regulatory reporting).
Taxation risk
The risk of unexpected tax charges, including interest and penalties including tax related events resulting in for example a 
damaged reputation with the tax authorities, investors, employees and the public at large.

The effectiveness of risk management is linked to 
commitment and integrity. It is crucial that the 
Board, the global and local department heads, as 
well as all employees are aware of the risks that our 
Company faces and their responsibilities in 
managing these effectively.
Our risk management is organized along three 
lines of defense. The first line of defense is 
comprised of Trading, Technology and Operations. 
These departments are critical for managing the 
core processes within Flow Traders and they are 
responsible for incorporating preventive and 
detective controls into the day-to-day trading and 
IT processes as well as for the continuous 
monitoring of our systems and trading controls.
The second line of defense is responsible for  
oversight and monitoring of risks, rules and 
requirements. Risk, Compliance, Legal and Finance 
manage risks through a combination of preventive 
and detective controls. Together they are 
responsible for the continuous risk management 
of the Company. 
On the second line we have the Financial & Capital 
Risk Committee and the Non-Financial Risk & 
Compliance Committee. The Financial & Capital 
Risk Committee includes oversight reporting and 
planning in relation to market, credit and treasury 
risk within the Company. Whereas the Non-
Financial Risk & Compliance Committee reviews a 
wide range of risks that are not directly related to 
financial matters, such as business and strategic 
risk, compliance and ethical risk, operational risk, 
operational risk and technology risk. 
The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’ Internal Audit function (IA). They provide independent and 
objective assurance and advice on the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control 
systems. This helps to achieve the competent application of systematic and disciplined processes, expertise, and 
insight. They report their findings to management and the governing body to promote and facilitate continuous 
improvement. The IA carries out its audit work in accordance with the approved and implemented Group 
Internal Audit Charter.

The annual Risk Management Cycle follows 
the ERMF
Every year the Executive Directors and senior 
leadership establish strategic goals, generally in 
November/December, subsequently the business 
targets are set. Then, the Board approves both the 
strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Board is involved in the strategy 
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are 
then translated into annual Company-wide, 
departmental and individual goals and discussed in 
an annual meeting with senior leadership. 
Based on the targets and objectives, the Executive 
Directors and senior leadership formulates the risk 
appetite of the Company. The targets, objectives and 
risk appetite give direction to the various 
departments within Flow Traders and are used to 
derive the Company’s strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management Cycle is used to 
identify, manage and mitigate our financial, non-
financial and compliance risks. The Risk 
Management Cycle consists of four recurring 
activities: risk identification & assessment, risk 
control, risk monitoring and risk reporting. The cycle 
is designed and implemented to determine and 
assess our risk, take mitigating actions to control our 
risk, monitor the effectiveness and developments of 
the taken measures and report findings and 
effectiveness of all measurements and actions taken. 
The Risk Management Cycle ensures that our 
residual risk profile remains in line with our annual 
set risk appetite and that emerging risks, changed 
risk levels or non-effective controls are identified, 
assessed and analyzed in a timely manner.

Risk reporting
Flow Traders has a Financial & Capital Risk  
Committee and a Non-Financial Risk & Compliance 
Committee that continuously assess the risks we face 
in our business, and are comprised of our Global 
Head of Risk and Compliance, the Executive 
Directors and certain members of our senior 
leadership. 
Aside from regular communication, there are  
quarterly Financial & Capital Risk and Non-Financial 
Risk & Compliance Committee meetings. During 
these meetings we discuss all risk assessments and 
risk proposals related to position limits, strategies, 
procedures, liquidity and capital requirements, 
regulatory compliance, AML, incidents and market 
developments. Any material change to our risk 
profile, systems, strategies and limits must 
subsequently be approved by the Financial & Capital 
Risk and Non-Financial Risk & Compliance 
Committees. 
In addition to these standing Committees, we have a 
Risk & Sustainability Committee, all members of the 
Board are members. The Global Head of Risk and 
Compliance informs the Risk & Sustainability 
Committee about the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems. This includes 
the reasonable assurance that the aforementioned 
systems do not contain any material inaccuracies. 
The tasks of the Risk & Sustainability Committee 
include supervision and monitoring, and advising the 
Executive Directors, and Global Heads of Trading on 
the operation of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems. As well as 
providing advice on the Company’s development, 
performance, sustainability of its trading strategies 
and reviewing the risk of the Company.

Key risks detailed 
Key financial risk 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk management is vital to maintain a 
robust financial institution. Liquidity risk is defined as 
the risk that Flow Traders Ltd. cannot meet its 
financial liabilities when they become due, at a 
reasonable cost and in a timely manner. We have a 
robust framework in place to manage liquidity risks, 
as insufficient liquidity can pose an immediate threat 
to the continuity of trading activities.
The liquidity risk framework includes, among others, 
requirements and processes related to the 
maintenance of the liquidity buffer, both in a 
‘business-as-usual’ and under potential stress 
situations. Furthermore, the framework contains 
procedures to actively manage liquidity risk across 
asset classes, countries, legal entities and in multiple 
currencies. This includes taking into account 
regulatory- and operational requirements for the 
maintenance of adequate liquidity.
Furthermore, we define liquidity as the sum of excess 
liquidity over the requirement (haircut) at our prime 
brokers, as that is the basis for being able to facilitate 
all funding and liquidity needs. Given our business 
model as a market maker where we generally hedge 
any position taken instantly, our key liquidity risk is 
not so much in risking a significant loss, but rather in 
not being able to cover the requirements our prime 
brokers charge us. Therefore, our key liquidity risks 
are those that affect either the total pool of liquid 
assets we hold at our prime brokers and crypto 
exchanges or the total requirement that our prime 
brokers necessitate us to hold with them (haircut).
Market risk
Flow Traders is exposed to market risk arising from 
trading positions in instruments that are price-
sensitive to various factors such as company 
valuations, interest rates, FX rates, commodities and 
digital asset prices. As a liquidity provider we 
continuously provide bid and offer prices in multiple 
product groups across multiple financial markets. 
The bid and offer prices are calibrated such that the 
expected value of the trades and the hedges are 
positive while the resulting market risk is immaterial.
We have a multitude of trading desks which are 
providing liquidity in various products and various 
markets. The core business being equity and fixed 
income products and the Company also trades FX, 
commodities and digital assets. Each individual desk 
trades (close to) delta neutral hereby ensuring total 
market risk is therefore close to delta neutral. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing 
institution involved in trading in or issuing a financial 
instrument defaulting on its obligation. As part of our 
credit risk framework, Flow Traders monitors 
platform credit risk on a real-time basis against an 
established credit risk limit. In addition, Flow Traders 
has real-time monitoring on platform assets in- and 
out-flows to be able to anticipate on a platform 
insolvency event. Furthermore, funding is spread 
across multiple platforms and counterparties 
ensuring a diversified allocation that greatly limits 
the impact of a possible credit risk or liquidation 
event. The Company manages credit risk through its 
Risk and Mid-Office department that provide specific 
guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, 
measuring and reporting credit risk. Policies include 
amongst others: 
▪
limits for individual product types;
▪
limits per counterparty;
▪
limits on the duration of the exposure; 
▪
limits for settlement types; 
▪
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Throughout 2024, improvements were made within 
the digital asset space noting enhancements of the 
credit risk framework including the establishment of 
a centralized view of all credit limits and automation 
of limit breaches and alerts.
Business and strategic risk
Concentration risk (Market business risk)  
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of 
the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the 
financial instruments in which we trade, and the bid-
ask spreads (which largely determine the profit on 
the trade, or margins, we capture). 
Trading volumes in securities, derivatives, currencies, 
commodities, cryptocurrencies and other financial 
instruments on exchange and on other trading 
venues are directly affected by factors beyond our 
control, including economic and political conditions, 
broad trends in business and finance, regulatory 
requirements, actions by central banks, and changes 
in the markets in which such transactions occur.
To cope with periods of low market activity, we have 
diversified our trading into different products and 
markets. This is to safeguard that we are not overly 
dependent on market activity in one particular asset 
class or product type.

Compliance and ethical risk 
Flow Traders continues to be a strong driver of 
effective, efficient and equal regulation and we 
contribute to the regulatory dialogue in our key 
jurisdictions to campaign for markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly manner.
Financial crime risk 
We are committed to complying with all relevant 
laws and regulations that apply to us, wherever we 
operate. Especially important are the rules around 
anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering.
We also have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-
money laundering policies in place that apply to all 
our employees. We expect our counterparties, 
business partners, intermediaries, contractors and 
subcontractors to adhere to the same standards. We 
believe that the risk of bribery or corruption is very 
limited as we do not hold or manage client money or 
assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain 
production facilities or source raw materials. 
Nevertheless, our employees receive regular training 
in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering practices, as the Board would like to 
reinforce the importance of these policies. 
As part of our compliance framework, we also follow  
stringent KYC process as part of our onboarding of 
new counterparties and projects.    
Regulatory compliance risk
We trade with institutional counterparties and do 
not provide investment services or ancillary services 
to third parties; our markets and nearly all aspects of 
our business are highly regulated. Where applicable, 
entities forming part of our Company have obtained 
the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses.
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in 
three international jurisdictions, Amsterdam, New 
York and Hong Kong/Singapore with branch offices 
established in London, Milan, Paris, Chicago and 
Shanghai. As a Company, we currently trade on 180+ 
exchanges and trading venues worldwide as well as 
operating on numerous other venues through our 
brokers. Our regulatory landscape is broad as we 
have to comply not only with our local regulations, 
but also the trading rules of all venues on which we 
trade. 
Legislators and regulators globally continue to 
closely supervise the financial markets in which we 
operate. This places significant demand on Flow 
Traders to maintain a professional, well-structured 
and compliant organization. 
The Compliance, Risk and Operations departments 
have implemented controls, internal rules and 
processes that have been systematically developed 
following applicable regulatory requirements, 
guidelines from market authorities, and industry best 
practices. 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable 
laws or regulatory requirements could adversely 
affect our reputation and in turn our long-term 
profitability and future business prospects. This may 
also be the case to a lesser degree for differences in 
interpretation or lack of timely or complete 
implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, 
disgorgement and censures, suspension or expulsion 
from trading venues or the revocation or limitation of 
licenses. 
We aim to minimize such risks by focusing 
considerable management attention to choose the 
most appropriate strategic approach. We employ 
highly-qualified compliance and risk professionals to 
allow the deployment of staff training; to efficiently 
update of our monitoring and reporting systems; and 
to be able to continuously evaluate the impact of 
current and upcoming regulations on our operations 
to find the optimal path to evolve our processes. 
Notwithstanding such efforts and given the highly 
regulated nature of our business, we remain subject 
to routine (and more targeted) inquiries and audits 
from our global regulators and our trading venues. 
In the course of 2023, Flow Traders B.V. received an 
information request by the Authority Financial 
Markets (AFM) to investigate compliance with the 
Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Flow Traders 
duly provided all required documentation and 
complied in full with the request. In early 2024, the 
AFM notified Flow Traders that no formal 
proceedings would take place pursuant to this 
request. In parallel, the AFM and the Dutch Central  
(DNB) requested further information in order to 
investigate compliance with the Dutch Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act 
(WwFT). This information was delivered in full in the 
first half year of 2024.
As of 31 December 2024, the investigation made 
significant progress, with the DNB issuing their final 
findings, which were deemed sufficient with 
comments. In early 2025, the AFM detailed their 
findings from the investigation under the WwFT. 
Currently, the AFM is not proceeding with imposing 
any formal measures against Flow Traders BV. We 
remain committed to implementing measures to 
address and resolve any identified shortcomings and 
findings and further strengthening our controls.

Conduct risk
Given the highly interconnected nature of the 
financial markets ecosystem we are a part of, we 
recognize that should any of the risks referenced 
within this section materialize, there could be a 
negative impact on various external third parties.
Specifically, market and operational risk events could 
negatively impact key parties within our value chain, 
namely our counterparties and our prime brokers. 
This could limit our counterparties’ ability to trade 
with us or to do settlement trades effectively on a 
timely basis. Moreover, the various prime brokers we 
work closely with could also be exposed to similar 
risks.
We believe that each employee has an individual and 
collective responsibility for ensuring an honest and 
ethical business conduct within our Company. 
Therefore, our Code of Conduct, forms part of our 
employment documentation.
Ensuring adherence with our Code of Conduct is the 
responsibility of the Executive Directors and the  
senior leadership. Any reported potential breaches 
are investigated fully by members of our senior 
leadership team in accordance with existing clearly 
laid out procedures and policies. Our Code of 
Conduct can be found on our website. 
In addition to our culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have detailed 
Whistleblower Policy in place for all employees and 
relevant contractors, approved by our Executive  
Directors. 
The Whistleblower Policy also provides any 
whistleblower with anonymity, confidentiality, and 
the Company will not impose sanctions on disclosure 
(or affect an employee’s legal position) when the 
employee reports a suspected misconduct in good 
faith, unless the employee is involved in the issue 
that is being reported. We respect a non-retaliation 
approach when a suspected misconduct is reported. 
Our Whistleblower Policy can be found on our 
website. 
Operational risk 
Business continuity risk 
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, 
systems or external events. Operational risk 
management is an integral part of our risk and 
control systems. Our operational risk is dominated by 
technology-related events at our exchanges and 
clearing members. Therefore, the level of our 
investment in technology is important to mitigate 
those associated risks as well as having resilient and 
robust internal systems and controls. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, high-
performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new 
hardware and software. 
Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement 
improvements in both hardware and software on an 
ongoing basis. Controlled releases of hardware and 
software enhancements provide for minimal 
disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or 
updates of our trading software) is being developed 
is strictly separated from the environment in which 
such trading software operates in production. Access 
to the source code is strictly controlled and limited. 
Prior to any releases relating to our trading software, 
or an update into our production environment, any 
element of our trading software is subjected to a 
review of its code, testing in a development 
environment that is separate from our production 
environment. Furthermore, validation occurs on  
limited production (processing a strictly limited 
number of trades) and on one trading desk in 
respect of trading a single financial instrument, 
followed by more extensive testing across multiple 
desks and/or trading multiple financial instruments. 
Each step must be completed before the next and 
also appropriately documented. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control 
undisrupted trading activities in real time. Multi-layer 
monitoring is employed to avoid errors. When an 
error does occur, the relevant teams are immediately 
notified via multiple different channels. We rely on 
multiple third-party service providers for business 
and market data, which is a key part of what is 
monitored. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with 
our proprietary technology platform, analyzing real-
time pricing data, and is designed to ensure that our 
order activity is conducted within strict 
predetermined trading and position limits. For 
example, our pre-trade [risk] controls are designed to 
prevent the trading engines from sending quotes 
that deviate from our predefined risk parameters. 
These include price and volume limits, which are 
independently set and monitored by our Risk 
function. This keeps our ordering, trading and 
positions well within our preset tolerance levels. Our 
post-trade monitoring tools include trade-level 
reconciliation of prices and positions against those of 
our exchanges and prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration 
tests by external experts. We have a comprehensive 
IT security system that is designed to protect us from 
attacks both from internally and externally.

Where we have a technical interface with institutions 
such as our prime brokers and exchanges, the 
integrity of the connection between the systems and 
the data that is being exchanged is subject to prior 
conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, 
we continuously review to ensure it adequately 
captures relevant scenarios. 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we 
start trading on any new platforms, including 
platforms designated for trading digital assets. While 
many of these platforms remain unregulated, many 
have strongly improved their own onboarding 
procedures and counterparty identification 
procedures. While we believe our own procedures 
are strong, the unregulated status of these platforms 
and their location in emerging economies makes 
them inherently less institutionalized and supervised 
than regulated platforms in developed economies. 
We therefore subject these platforms to increased 
monitoring and due diligence.
Technology risk 
While the firm’s foundation is technology-driven, 
these risks and impacts are reflected and linked with 
the above categories. Specifically, under technology 
risks, we have carved out cyber risks to highlight a 
key component that the firm considers high priority. 
Cyber security risk 
Cyber security is the risk of not protecting computer 
systems, networks and data from digital attacks, 
unauthorized access and therefore posing damage 
or disruption to the firm. 
Cyber security risk management is the process of 
identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and addressing an 
organization's cyber security threats. The goal is to 
protect the organization's information systems from 
cyber attacks and data breaches while minimizing 
potential damage. The cyber security risk category 
was established together with the formalization of 
the risk appetite in 2024 to ensure a more focused 
approach to mitigating related cyber and 
information security risks. 
Over 2024, the firm has put in extensive efforts 
throughout multiple departments to ensure 
compliance with the Digital Operational Resilience 
Act (DORA) in force from January 2025. Whilst not all 
secondary legislative acts and regulatory guidelines 
are complete and implemented, the firm at this 
moment believes to be compliant with the DORA 
regulation.
Internal Audit (IA) 
The IA function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and 
objective assurance, advice, and insight. An effective 
IA contributes to strong internal controls and to a 
robust governance structure, which can address key 
structural risks. 
The scope of IA's work includes the examination and 
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of our  
risk management, control and governance 
processes. It also includes quality assurance work 
reviewing our performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve our stated goals and 
objectives.
Our Group IA Charter defines the IA’s purpose, 
authority, responsibility and position within the 
organization. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance 
provided by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).
The IA function is an integral part of our reporting 
cycle. The IA function reports to the Audit Committee 
and to the CEO. It aligns its efforts with our external 
auditor and reports its audit results to the Board, the 
Audit Committee and informs the external auditor.
The Board assesses the way in which the IA function 
fulfills its responsibility annually and takes the 
opinion of the Audit Committee into account. 
Flow Traders IA function conforms to the 
International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) 
of the IIA.

Sustainability information 
General basis of preparation for the 
sustainability information  
The sustainability information in this Annual Report 
covers the material topics identified following our 
2024 Double Materiality Assessment (DMA).
It provides an overview of Flow Traders’ metrics from 
1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024. This report 
complies with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive 
(NFRD) and the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
Flow Traders has volunteered to not report under 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 
as it is not transposed in Dutch law. We continue to 
monitor developments in relation to the adoption of 
the CSRD within Dutch legislation and the 
implications of the European Commissions’ Omnibus 
Announcement in February 2025. 
Governance of sustainability matters
We have established a governance structure that 
oversees the rollout of our ESG priorities, along with 
their associated impacts, risks, and opportunities 
(IROs). 
We manage sustainability through this structure that 
spans multiple organizational levels, ensuring 
accountability and execution. This includes the 
Board, the Risk & Sustainability Committee, the ESG 
team, theme owners, KPI action owners, and other 
topical experts. 
Sustainability expertise
Collectively the Board has a sufficient level of 
knowledge of sustainability to oversee its 
governance. Please see the skills and expertise 
matrix in the Board composition section of the Board 
report. 
Risk management of sustainability matters
Sustainability and environmental risk are defined in 
our internal policies as the risk that ESG (related) 
issues or events will impact the entity financially, 
non-financially and/or in the realization of strategic 
objectives of the entity. Our leadership is charged 
with monitoring the sustainability and 
environmental risks via the Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework. Environmental and 
sustainability risks are monitored by our second line 
of defense.

Double Materiality Assessment (DMA)
The DMA serves as the foundation for prioritizing the 
sustainability matters most relevant to us and our 
stakeholders.
Our stakeholders include individuals and groups 
affected by our activities, those with a (in)direct 
interest in our operations and value chain, 
comprising of our end-to-end operational partners 
such as exchanges, counterparties, prime brokers 
etc, and those who influence our long and short term 
success.
Materiality framework five step approach
How we identify our material topics
Our materiality framework consists of five steps to 
assess the effect of our business on the environment 
and society, as well as the reverse. The DMA 
concludes the following: (1) Flow Traders’ most 
material impacts are related to our people and 
environment, and (2) the key sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities stem from our own 
operations and stakeholders within our value chain. 
Stakeholder engagement
We are committed to ongoing stakeholder 
engagements which includes ESG strategic theme 
owners, business experts, and the ESG team. Our 
Stakeholder Engagement Policy outlines our key  
principles for engagement.
Our engagement efforts span dialogues with 
investors, financial market associations, and partners 
across our value chain, as well as ESG-related 
questionnaires received from these stakeholders. 
These engagements have provided insights into the 
evolving classification and standardization of data for 
sustainable investment products, including the 
Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) 
and EU Taxonomy legislation. Additionally, they have 
highlighted the growing financial impact of cyber 
security risks, particularly in the context of 
compliance with the Digital Operational Resilience 
Act (DORA) and the rising frequency of external 
cyber threats.

Every three years, 
we conduct a survey 
to validate our 
material topics by 
our stakeholders, 
such as employees, 
leadership, 
shareholders, 
counterparties and 
suppliers on key ESG 
matters.
The results of the DMA 
serve as input for the 
sustainability priorities. 
Material issues are 
grouped into themes  
and connected to value 
drivers to keep focus on 
significant impacts.

Preparation of the 2024 sustainability 
information
Our materiality framework is designed to reflect the 
requirements from, among others, the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), DMA 
guidance and industry best practices. We conduct a 
comprehensive DMA every three years, 
supplemented by annual reviews our material topics 
in light of new insights, evolving stakeholder 
expectations, shifts in the regulatory landscape, and 
the progress we have achieved. 
In late 2023, we completed a comprehensive 
materiality assessment based on double materiality 
principles.
The assessment leveraged ESRS, entity-specific 
considerations and industry-leading practices. The 
DMA includes the impact and financial materiality to 
address societal, business conduct and 
environmental impacts as well as the financial 
implications of sustainability-related risks and 
opportunities.

Environmental footprint
We believe that everyone should contribute to 
reducing their Greenhouse gases (GHG) footprint 
and that all efforts, no matter how small, brings us 
closer to a sustainable and thriving planet. 
Establishing environmental footprint priorities with 
clear and achievable objectives is a critical step 
towards a sustainable future.
Our environmental priorities
We are committed to supporting the global 
transition toward a sustainable, climate-neutral 
economy by minimizing our environmental impact. 
To this end, we are committed to reducing the 
environmental footprint of our business operations.
Our business activities do not involve manufacturing, 
so our GHG footprint is relatively low. Most of our 
electricity consumption is tied to office operations, 
including lighting, temperature control, and 
electronic devices. In terms of carbon footprint, we 
identify three impact areas:
▪
The indirect scope 2 GHG emissions from the 
electricity consumption in our offices
▪
The indirect scope 3 GHG emissions from business 
travel (cat. 6) and employee commute (cat. 7)
▪
The indirect scope 3 GHG emissions from our data 
center services suppliers (cat. 1) 
Our direct scope 1 GHG emissions from fossil fuels are 
minimal. Our office buildings use electricity for 
heating. Our focus begins with what we can directly 
control: decarbonizing our own operations. Looking 
ahead, climate action will be essential for partnering 
with high-value, reputable chains, making a well-
defined strategy with realistic objectives crucial to 
our ambition.
Challenges we face
Our operations span ten locations across three 
continents, EMEA, APAC, and the Americas, with key 
hubs in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and New York. 
Additionally, we operate branch offices in London, 
Cluj, Milan, Paris, Shanghai, Singapore, and Chicago. 
When it comes to the environmental GHG footprint 
of our operations, the majority of our impact comes 
from our three largest offices (Amsterdam, Hong 
Kong and New York), which house approximately 
90% of our workforce. In developing our environment 
priorities, we encountered two key challenges:
▪
Regional discrepancies in environmental 
reporting: In Europe, environmental reporting has 
been a focus for many years, gaining even more 
attention with the CSRD legislation. However, in 
other regions, we encounter varying levels of 
maturity in CO2 measurement and reporting
▪
Access to renewable energy: The availability of 
renewable energy differs greatly across our 
regions
These challenges highlight the complexity of 
reporting and the reduction of our emissions due to 
our reliance on third-parties, yet they drive us to find 
innovative solutions as we work towards a more 
sustainable future.
Climate change transition plan
We conducted a resilience analysis in 2024. We are 
committed to supporting the transition to a low-
carbon economy by reducing our environmental 
footprint and enhancing climate resilience. Key 
elements of our transition plan includes:
▪
Renewable energy adoption: We are working with 
landlords to transition to 100% renewable 
electricity, reducing the carbon footprint in our 
offices in Amsterdam, New York and Hong Kong
▪
GHG emissions reduction: We aim to reduce 
scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by 2030, primarily 
through phasing out fossil fuel company car and 
enhancing energy efficiency in our office 
operations
▪
GHG emission reduction: Our objectives for our 
data centers are to increase our share of 
renewable energy at each location
▪
Climate risk assessment: Through climate 
scenario analysis, we evaluate physical and 
transition risks to our operations
▪
Stakeholder engagement: We collaborate with 
key stakeholders to drive sustainability initiatives, 
integrating climate considerations into decision-
making
Policies related to environmental footprint 
While we have not yet formalized a dedicated 
environmental policy, we are actively implementing 
climate-related actions to reduce our environmental 
footprint.

The Company relies on estimates and assumption in the consolidated reported numbers above. They are derived from various sources, and the methods for processing data vary across our operating subsidiaries and departments. This creates a degree 
of uncertainty due to limitations in measuring and estimating data. We are continuously working to improve our sustainability data control environment and collection processes. See chapter About Sustainability information. 
* The emissions for Scope 2 reported for 2023, amounted 966 tCO2e, were originally reported under the location-based method. This figure has now been corrected to market-based emissions. The total Scope 1 reported for 2023 remains unchanged,

EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy is a centerpiece of the EU actions 
to support the transition to a sustainable economy, in 
which the financial sector plays a vital role. It aims to 
provide a basis for harmonized and comparable 
disclosures related to economic activities that 
qualifies as environmentally sustainable. 
To provide investors meaningful information about 
the ESG performance of an investment or fund, we 
believe that an international applied Taxonomy 
framework, unified definitions and an open-access 
data source are key for the practical implementation 
of the EU Taxonomy.  
Environmental objectives
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system used to 
determine, and report on, which activities are 
sustainable. For corporate activities to be considered 
sustainable under the Taxonomy, they must: 
▪
Substantially contribute to at least one of the six 
environmental objectives per the Technical 
Screening Criteria (TSC) defined in the Regulation; 
▪
Do no significant harm to any of the remaining 
five environmental objectives
▪
Comply with the minimum social safeguards
Applicable reporting requirements
Reporting requirements for Flow Traders: In 
compliance with section 2.4. of Annex VII Disclosures 
Delegated Act (DDA), investment firms should 
compute the GAR for their services and activities 
dealing on own account by relying on the turnover 
KPI and CapEx KPI of investee undertakings for each 
environmental objective.
The calculations for the turnover-based and CapEx-
based KPIs of investee companies are specified per 
type of investee company in Annex VII DDA, section 
2.4., third paragraph, points (a) to (e). The KPIs for 
investment firms’ activities other than dealing on 
own accounts should be calculated mutatis 
mutandis using turnover-based and CapEx-based 
KPIs of counterparties of their clients (Annex VII DDA, 
section 3.3.).
Data availability
We conducted a data assessment to gain an 
overview of the required data points needed for Flow 
Traders’ EU Taxonomy GAR disclosure. Our 
assessment consists of five steps, each with detailed 
procedures to evaluate the feasibility of such 
reporting:
▪
Step 1: Understanding the GAR calculation 
▪
Step 2: Understanding the data points and other 
data requirements
▪
Step 3: Assessing the feasibility of obtaining the 
required the data points
▪
Step 4: Testing the Flow Traders’ EU Taxonomy – 
KPI GAR reporting
▪
Step 5: The use of data sets from external data 
providers
Based on this comprehensive assessment, we 
conclude the following: Flow Traders is entirely 
dependent on external (market) data providers to 
compile the GAR reporting. We have reached out to 
our market data provider for EMEA ETPs and ETFs, 
however our assessment into the available market 
data shows that the portion of relevant data for GAR 
and EU Taxonomy-aligned activities is very limited. 
Only a fraction of the ‘assets held for trading’ are 
covered by available data. Given the novelty and 
evolving nature of sustainability-related disclosures – 
where the EU, US, and Asia are progressing at 
different paces – we believe that the EU Taxonomy 
KPI, despite its limitations, should be accompanied 
by contextual information to facilitate the 
appropriate interpretation of disclosures made by 
market makers.
In light of this, we strongly advocate that the 
European Commission revisit the scope and KPIs of 
financial undertakings, distinguishing between 
investment firms dealing on their own account that 
a) have a direct influence on investment strategies 
and b) those that do not take such positions. 
Our 2024 EU Taxonomy reporting
As a result, Flow Traders is unable to meet the EU 
Taxonomy reporting requirements. For the 2024 
Annual Report EU Taxonomy disclosure, Flow Traders 
will report a ‘zero value’ for Green Asset Ratio (GAR) 
and EU Taxonomy-aligned activities.
This conclusion is based on the EU Commission 
Notice dated 21 December 2023, which provides 
guidance on handling data constraints in FAQ point 
5: ‘What should financial undertakings report if 
counterparty entities’ KPIs are not publicly available 
or are inaccurate?’
In compliance with Article 8(4) of the Disclosures 
Delegated Act, financial undertakings must use the 
most recently available information and KPIs of their 
counterparties for their Taxonomy-alignment 
reporting. However, when such KPIs are not publicly 
or readily available, financial undertakings are 
encouraged to contact those counterparties. If, 
despite efforts, relevant KPIs cannot be obtained or 
remain unfit, or if KPIs from previous years are also 
unavailable, the exposure should be considered non-
eligible or not aligned. In such cases, financial 
undertakings are to enter a ‘zero value.’

Sustainable employment
As society evolves, so does our Company. Over the 
past two decades we have grown into a global 
trading firm with an entrepreneurial spirit. We strive 
to continuously understand and address the needs of 
our team, always focusing on enhancing our culture 
and making Flow Traders the best place to work.
We are committed to fostering an international, 
diverse, and empowering environment centered on 
teamwork, collaboration, and talent development. To 
sustain our business success, it is essential that our 
employees take pride in being part of our Company 
and feel connected to our goals. Every individual 
plays a vital role, and our leadership is dedicated to 
providing clear direction and recognizing top talent.
How we can contribute - our people strategy
The competition for talent in the labor market is 
intense, especially for the individuals we want to 
attract and retain. Therefore, keeping our best talent 
on board is critical. The need to foster engagement 
across our employee base and ensure a diverse and 
inclusive work environment has become more 
important. We prioritize retention while at the same 
time focus on attracting new talent. This is how we 
deliver on our ‘People’ mission; ‘Empower the best to 
become even better’.
Our vision for sustainable employment reflects our 
long-term commitment to our people. We want our 
workforce to deliver added value to our Company, 
while also experiencing personal growth and 
fulfillment.
Our approach to realizing this long-term ambition is 
captured in our people strategy. Our Human 
Resources and Recruitment (HRR) team focus on 
three pillars:
▪
Attraction of new talent
▪
Retention of the best talent 
▪
Culture that unifies our ambitions
We want to offer our workforce the best possible 
employee experience, and empower them to thrive 
and feel truly valued. Employee experience is rarely a 
straight line, as individuals are at different stages in 
their journeys and have varying needs. We offer 
multiple career paths and provide a range of tools to 
support our employees in navigating their careers.
Recruitment 
In the demanding and regulated financial market, 
where technology is key, our selection process is 
rigorous. Our recruitment approach, particularly for 
trading roles, is focused on graduates, as we believe  
in cultivating talent from the ground up. We view  
recruitment as a dynamic, ongoing process that we  
continuously refine, enabling us to quickly adapt to  
evolving business demands and the needs of our  
people. We actively participate in:
▪
Campus visits
▪
University career fairs and workshops
▪
In-House Business Courses for students to 
experience trading
▪
Partner with student associations

Onboarding
A positive onboarding experience is essential for  
building a sense of connection, ensuring a smooth  
transition, and enhancing retention. Our onboarding  
program is a two-week introduction designed to  
welcome new colleagues, immerse them in our  
purpose and values, and provide insight into how  
different parts of the business operate. It is also an 
opportunity for new hires to connect with others who 
are starting their journey with us. For those  
relocating to our offices from abroad, we provide  
comprehensive support to help them feel at home 
quickly.
Learning
To cultivate a culture that inspires innovation and risk 
awareness, we must ensure that our people have 
access to the right knowledge at the right time. That 
is why we established the Flow Academy, our in-
house learning and development center, designed to 
provide tailored training for our Technology, Trading, 
and Business Support teams.
For new graduates, we offer the Digital Assets Talent 
Program and an extensive Graduate Trading 
Program, both of which accelerate their learning 
curve and enhance their experience. These programs 
include continuous support from dedicated mentors, 
focus on technical expertise but also on personal 
development.
Given the collaborative and innovative nature of our 
business, most of our training occurs on the job. We 
champion the 70-20-10 approach to learning, where 
70% is gained through on-the-job experiences, 20% 
through coaching, and 10% through structured 
training courses. This approach ensures that our 
people are constantly learning, developing, and 
ready to drive our success forward.
Growing
We empower our people to take charge of their  
personal development, pursue their career  
ambitions, and thrive by actively listening to their  
needs and offering personalized growth  
opportunities. Our success as an organization is  
intrinsically linked to the well-being and fulfillment of  
every individual on our team.
We also encourage our employees to explore  
rotational opportunities across different offices,  
allowing them to expand their horizons, collaborate  
with diverse teams, and enhance their capabilities. To  
foster continuous development, we offer a wide array  
of company-wide and tailored training opportunities. 
Leading
We operate in a world defined by volatility and 
complexity. To navigate these challenges, we need 
leaders who possess strong business acumen and 
excel in people leadership, embodying our Company 
values with authenticity. True leadership is about 
providing our people with a clear vision of where we 
are headed, inspiring them to contribute to our 
success and make a meaningful impact.
As we continue to evolve the need for clarity in roles 
and expectations becomes even more critical. Our 
leaders play a vital role in defining these expectations 
for their teams while also being transparent about 
their own responsibilities. We invest in our future 
leaders through targeted leadership programs and 
fast-tracking the careers of our most promising 
managers. These programs equip our managers with 
the skills and competencies needed to excel in their 
roles and lead with confidence.
Succession planning is a key part of our strategy, 
identifying top talent who have the potential to step 
into critical leadership roles in the future. This 
ensures we are always prepared for the next section 
of our growth, with a pipeline of leaders ready to 
guide us forward.
Challenges we face
Across our business, we have implemented targeted 
programs that empower our people to take charge 
of their development and career aspirations while 
enabling leaders to guide our growth. We have 
succeeded in creating a positive work environment 
where employees feel valued, and strong cross-team 
collaboration is the norm. However, despite these 
achievements, we still can make improvements in 
several key areas.
We see enhancing the employee experience as a 
continuous journey, evolving along the changing 
needs of our people and society. Each year, we 
carefully review the results of our employee 
engagement survey to identify key areas for further 
improvement, ensuring we remain committed to 
fostering a workplace where every employee feels 
supported and motivated to thrive.
Our workforce is vibrant and youthful, with many 
joining us early in their careers and experiencing 
rapid growth. This steep learning curve is both an 
opportunity and a challenge, as a portion of our 
leaders in management positions are young and still 
gaining experience. 
Secondly, retaining the dynamic group of young 
professionals is crucial, as we have observed higher 
attrition rates among our newest hires. 
Thirdly, while we successfully recruit and hire the 
talent we need, the labor market for science, 
technology, engineering and math (STEM) 
professionals remains highly competitive,  
particularly when it comes to attracting female talent 
in our core departments of Trading and Technology.

As with many tech-driven industries, achieving 
greater gender diversity continues to be a challenge, 
requiring targeted efforts to attract, retain, and 
advance females in these fields. Therefore we deploy 
initiatives to promote trading and technology among 
females. 
Policies related to employment 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Policy
Our DE&I Policy defines our commitment to 
fostering an inclusive workplace where all employees 
are valued and respected. We recognize DE&I as a 
business imperative and have established clear KPIs 
to promote diversity, enhance leadership 
representation, and drive continuous improvement. 
We create a workplace where everyone is welcome 
regardless of e.g., race, ethnicity, nationalities, age, 
gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
gender expression, disability, economic status and 
other diverse backgrounds. 
Human Rights Policy
We are committed to upholding internationally 
recognized human rights standards across our 
operations, supply chains, and the communities in 
which we operate. We are dedicated to protecting 
the human rights of our workforce and other 
stakeholders. We oppose forced labor, child labor, 
and human trafficking across our workforce. Our 
Human Rights Policy, established by Flow Traders 
Ltd., applies to all employees, contingent workers, 
subsidiaries, and business partners. We align with 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and have been a proud signatory of the 
United Nations Global Compact since 2022. This 
policy extends to protected groups and affected 
communities, reinforcing our responsibility to ethical 
and sustainable business practices. 
Local labor practices 
Flow Traders is committed to full compliance with 
local labor laws and regulations in all jurisdictions 
where we operate. We uphold fair employment 
practices, ensure safe working conditions, and 
protect employee rights in compliance with 
applicable labor standards. We embrace a balanced 
approach with a 40-hour workweek, empowering 
our people to excel while maintaining harmony 
between their professional and personal life. Our 
internal Staff Manual provides more detailed 
information on labor practices for our employees. 
Whistleblowing Policy 
Our Whistleblowing Policy provides a secure and 
confidential channel for employees, business 
partners, and other stakeholders to report suspected 
misconduct, unethical behavior, or violations of laws 
and company policies without fear of retaliation. Key 
principles of our policy include confidentiality and 
protection, secure reporting channels, thorough 
investigation, effective resolution, and compliance 
with legal and regulatory requirements.
Staff Manual
Our Staff Manual forms an integral part of the 
agreement between the employer and employees. 
The Staff Manual serves to clarify the rights and 
obligations of the employer and its employees with 
respect to personal records, working condition, 
business travel, performance management and 
more. Flow Traders does not have a formalized 
accident prevention policy, however accidents and 
incidents can be raised through the departmental 
incident reporting mechanisms.
Learning and development (L&D) 
We offer a diverse range of L&D opportunities 
tailored to every business department to enhance 
and elevate professional skills, which is available to 
our employees in the Staff Manual. Beyond role-
specific training, we provide non-functional courses 
aimed at guiding employees on their career 
navigation journey. We encourage internal mobility 
across departments and our global offices, fostering 
a culture of continuous learning and self-discovery.

Good governance 
Establishing a risk aware culture is crucial for 
building the right structures and preventing 
misconduct. This culture is driven by leadership tone, 
accountability, and open communication. Leadership 
must set the right example through role modelling 
our core values, shaping the ethical foundation our 
Company. 
How we can contribute
Our commitment to ethical behavior is laid down in 
our Code of Conduct, which is based on our values 
and how we define our corporate culture. We expect 
every employee to uphold to the Code of Conduct, 
ensuring a safe working environment and a respect 
for human rights. We embed our core values into 
business conduct, providing guidance through 
shared beliefs, a clear purpose, mission, norms, and 
transparent ways of working. A strong ethical 
foundation mitigates risks of, such as misconduct, 
non-compliance, business disruption, legal 
challenges and reputational damage.
Flow Traders has in place processes for identifying, 
reporting and addressing incidents of non-
compliance with with its Code of Conduct. Within 
every department in Flow Traders there is an 
incident reporting policy that drives this process so 
that any behavior that contradicts our Code of 
Conduct is identified and investigated. 
Our five cultural pillars define our identity
Wherever we operate, we believe that honesty and 
the highest standards of integrity are fundamental to 
creating value for our stakeholders and ensuring our 
long-term success. Our corporate policies and 
procedures, which detail our principles and 
compliance standards, serve as a compass for 
making the right decisions and staying true to our 
values. Please refer to the corporate documents 
section on our website. 
Challenges we face
With the rapid expansion of ESG requirements, 
alongside financial regulations, and cybersecurity 
requirements, we navigate an increasingly complex 
compliance landscape and obligations. Challenge lies 
in the various compliance and incident reporting, 
with multiple processes of which some using their 
own systems. To enhance transparency, efficiency, 
and regulatory alignment, centralizing incident 
reporting is a priority for us.
Measuring our impact
Our compliance program is designed to identify, 
assess, and manage the impacts and risks associated 
with actual and potential incidents. We promote and 
uphold ethical behavior, fostering a corporate culture 
where speaking up is encouraged and appreciated. 
Our metric compliance awareness score reflects our 
commitment to compliance reporting and risk 
management. All employees are responsible for 
reporting incidents whenever they encounter a 
suspect of (potential) breach of our Code of Conduct 
or compliance manual. An incident is defined as any 
event involving a (potential) breach of our 
compliance policies that necessitates further action. 
The departmental incident reporting policies drive 
the compliance score.

Business conduct and corporate culture
Business conduct and our culture is at the core of 
everything we do. We operate within a highly 
regulated market. Upholding the highest ethical 
standards and adhering to our own policies and 
procedures is central to our business conduct and 
corporate culture. We enforce a zero-tolerance policy 
for any form of undesirable behavior and have 
reporting procedures in place to address and resolve 
issues, ensuring accountability to all stakeholders. 
These reporting procedures are set out in the policies  
below. 
Policies related to governance  
Whistleblowing Policy 
We promote a culture of openness and transparency, 
encouraging both our employees and external 
partners to speak up when they encounter any 
concerns or suspect potential abuse or violations of 
our Code of Conduct, Company Policies, values, or 
the law. Our Global Whistleblowing Policy ensures a 
safe and secure reporting and investigation process, 
with zero tolerance for retaliation or any adverse 
consequences against those who raise concerns in 
good faith or participate in investigations. If a report 
is later found to be unfounded, we are committed to 
protecting and supporting those who stand up for 
integrity. Our Global Whistleblower Policy is available 
on our website. 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy 
Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABC) Policy 
sets our commitment to and the standards for 
preventing bribery and corruption, while ensuring 
that any concerns about unlawful behavior are 
identified, reported, and investigated. This policy is 
aligned with the UN Convention against corruption.  
Every employee is responsible for upholding honesty 
and ethical conduct in all aspects of their work, as 
outlined in our ABC Policy. It is both a right and a 
duty to report any suspected abuse to the 
Compliance department or anonymously to the 
Trusted Person, without fear of retaliation.
Please see our Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption 
Policy on our website. Read more in section: Risk 
management - Compliance and ethical risk. 
Public Affairs Policy
As part of our broad public affairs strategy, we 
connect with stakeholders and peers to foster 
dialogue and align perspectives on emerging 
regulatory developments and societal trends 
shaping our industry. We engage in policy 
influencing to support our business objectives, 
collaborating with trade associations and a diverse 
range of stakeholders.
A cornerstone of this strategy is establishing open, 
constructive dialogues with our stakeholders, 
ensuring we respond to their views and concerns 
while balancing competing expectations. By 
addressing pressing issues and demonstrating our 
positive societal impact, we aim to continuously 
enhance our business.
Overall, 2024 was an progressive year in terms of 
political developments. Our main points of interests 
over 2024 were the discussion on the (global) 
regulatory framework for digital assets, the 
shortening of settlement cycles in the U.S., UK and 
Europe, and driving transparency in the markets, in 
particular in the bond market by the introduction of 
the consolidated tape in the EU and UK. 
Our contributions to industry bodies reflect our 
commitment to shaping the future of our market. 
Examples include:
▪
Serving on the Board of the Dutch Association of 
Proprietary Traders (APT)
▪
Holding the vice-chair position of the Executive 
Committee of the European Proprietary Traders 
Association (FIA-EPTA)
▪
Membership in Holland Fintech
▪
Participating in the EC Consolidated Tape Expert 
Stakeholder Group and consultative work streams 
of FIA-Asia, as well as various advisory committees

contributions. Our public affairs expenditures are 
focused on membership contributions, monitoring 
and advisory fees, and (internal) operational costs 
and expenses.
We foster transparency and our contributions to the 
regulatory and legislative dialogue are typically made

Cyber security
We have developed a robust and advanced 
proprietary trading technology platform that 
underpins our operational excellence and company 
performance. Our commitment to maintaining high 
standards of reliability ensures seamless support for 
our trading activities. We prioritize IT security to 
nurture the trust of our stakeholders, focusing on 
safeguarding our technology, securing data 
exchanges with issuers and counterparties, and 
defending against cyber threats.
Recognizing the intricate nature of our IT landscape, 
we have devised strategies to mitigate risks 
effectively. Our security function is equipped with 
top-tier competencies, governance, and capabilities 
that span our entire IT infrastructure and the 
business at large. We ensure constant access to 
networks, systems, and data by managing risks from 
technical failures, human errors, potential cyber 
threats, and natural disasters proactively.
While the total elimination of cyber risk is elusive, our 
dedication to managing and minimizing system 
disruptions is steadfast. We have robust contingency 
plans in place to ensure business continuity under 
various scenarios. In response to the evolving threat 
landscape, we have implemented clear policies and 
procedures to guide our employees, conducted 
thorough training programs, and fostered a culture 
of security vigilance. These measures ensure our 
team is well-prepared to uphold the highest 
standards of information security.
Taxation 
We are committed to being good corporate citizens, 
bringing positive value to the communities we 
operate in. A key part of this commitment involves 
paying taxes where they are due and subscribing to 
fair taxation.
We believe it is vital to operate a fair, transparent and 
straightforward Tax Policy, which is required when 
running a sustainable business and delivering long-
term value to all our stakeholders. This is also 
reflected in the tax principles included in our 
Principles of Responsible Tax Behavior, as published 
on our website. The Flow Traders Tax Function will 
therefore provide applicable input as part of the 
approval process for business proposals to ensure a 
clear understanding of the tax consequences. 
Flow Traders also established a Tax Control 
Framework, members include the Board, Audit 
Committee, Finance department and Tax 
department. They are responsible for assessing and 
weighing the risks associated with the tax decision 
process for our business and stakeholders. Under this 
Tax Control Framework, significant tax positions, 
including the tax strategy, are shared with and 
subject to the approval of the Board. 
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of 
its financial reporting and its relations with tax 
authorities globally. Regarding financial reporting, 
conservative accounting principles are being applied 
and one-offs must occur infrequently and be clearly 
documented. 
We support transparency initiatives, such as Pillar II 
legislation and country-by-country reporting, and 
frequently assess the impact of such initiatives. We 
also closely monitor impact for Flow Traders, to 
ensure that we comply with local and international 
legislation and meet our reporting obligations. 
Where necessary or relevant, we take the appropriate 
actions to adopt these initiatives in our Tax Control 
Framework. We have good standing relationships 
with the tax authorities in each region in which we 
operate. We proactively manage our relationship 
with the tax authorities with the aim of minimizing 
the risk of challenge, dispute or damage that could 
have an impact on our credibility.
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local and international tax 
legislation. We do not use tax haven jurisdictions for 
tax avoidance purposes and carry out our business 
through entities resident in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the Company can operate its 
business in line with its belief that it is part of the 
corporate social responsibility duty to pay taxes 
where it operates. In addition to corporate income 
taxes, Flow Traders pays many other taxes, including 
but not limited to, payroll taxes and social security 
contributions on the wages of its employees, value 
added taxes and property taxes. All these taxes are a 
significant basis of funding governmental public 
services. It is our social responsibility to contribute 
through taxes in the regions we operate in.

Functioning of the Board
The Board is responsible for the continuity of the 
Company and is guided by the interests of the 
Company and its associated business. The Board 
takes into consideration the Company’s sustainable 
long-term value creation and the interests of the 
Company’s stakeholders, including our employees 
and our shareholders. The Executive Directors are 
primarily charged with the Company's day-to-day 
operations, subject to the limitations set out in the 
Companies Act and our Bye-Laws. The Non-
Executive Directors are primarily charged with the 
supervision of the performance of the duties of the 
Executive Directors and assist by providing advice 
and direction. For a more detailed description of the 
governance concerning the Board, and the specific 
duties of the Executive Directors and the Non-
Executive Directors, please refer to the Company’s 
Bye-Laws and Board Rules on our website.
Board Committees
The Board may from time to time establish 
permanent or ad-hoc committees. As at the date of 
this Annual Report, the Board has established four 
committees: the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee, the Risk & 
Sustainability Committee and the Trading & 
Technology Committee. The composition of each 
committee is reflected in the table following this 
paragraph. The composition did not change 
throughout 2024. Each committee has a preparatory 
and/or advisory role to the Board. The Committee 
Charters provide for the possibility of the Board to 
delegate decision-making in writing to the 
Committees on matters that fall within their 
respective tasks and responsibilities. For a more 
detailed description of the governance concerning 
the committees, please refer to the respective 
Committee Charters on our website.
(“C” = chair, “X” = member)
Chairman & Vice-Chairman
The Board appointed Rudolf Ferscha as Chairman 
and Jan van Kuijk as Vice-Chairman. The Chairman 
acts as the main contact for the Directors regarding 
the functioning of the Board. The Chairman is 
primarily responsible for the functioning of the Board 
and its committees and is responsible for ensuring 
the proper conduct of business at meetings of the 
Board in order to promote a meaningful discussion 
at meetings. As a general rule, the Chairman presides 
over the General Meeting. The Vice-Chairman 
deputizes for the Chairman and is the main contact 
on behalf of the Board regarding the Chairman's 
performance.
Conflicts of interest
In case of a conflict of interest, the Board will 
determine, on a simple majority vote, if a Director's 
interest indeed conflicts with the interests of the 
Company or its business in such a way as described 
in section 24.6 of the Bye-Laws. In 2024, there have 
been no cases of conflicts of interest or transactions 
between the Company and members of the Board. 
There has been one transaction with a shareholder 
holding at least 10% of the shares of the Company. 
For more information, refer to note 34 related parties 
in the consolidated financial statements.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors 
Best practice in terms of corporate governance 
prescribes that at most one of the Non-Executive 
Directors on the Board qualifies as non-independent 
and that the total number of non-independent Non-
Executive Directors should account for less than half 
of the total number of Non-Executive Directors. Jan 
van Kuijk, as a co-founder of the Company, was 
attracted to his role as Non-Executive Director 
because of his specific business-related expertise. He 
did not qualify as independent under the provisions 
of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code as he is a 
former member of the Management Board of the 
Company, and because he represents a shareholder 
of the Company owning an interest of over 10%. As 
such, the number of non-independent Non-
Executive Directors on the Board amounts to one.
Despite the fact that Jan van Kuijk did not qualify as 
an independent Non-Executive Director as set out 
above, more than half of all Non-Executive Directors 
are independent.

General meeting, shares and 
shareholders 
It is of great importance to the Company and the 
Board that our shareholders voice their views and 
actively participate in decision-making during the 
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM). We 
pride ourselves on encouraging an open dialogue 
and ensuring that the General Meeting is adequately 
provided with information required to actively 
participate. 
In accordance with our Bye-laws and subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, the Company's 
Board shall convene, and the Company shall hold 
General Meetings as AGMs no later than six months 
after the end of the financial year. The Board may, 
whenever it deems necessary, and shall, when 
requisitioned by shareholders pursuant to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, convene General 
Meetings other than AGMs which shall be called 
Special General Meetings, at such time and place as 
the Board may appoint.
Subject to the Companies Act, a resolution may only 
be moved and put to a vote at a General Meeting if (i) 
it is proposed by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) it 
is proposed at the direction of a competent court, (iii) 
it is proposed on the requisition in writing by eligible 
shareholders, and (iv) the Chairman of the meeting in 
their absolute discretion decides that the resolution 
may properly be regarded as within scope of the 
meeting.
Save as otherwise provided in our Bye-Laws, at least 
two shareholders present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote on the matter representing the 
holders of at least 20%, or the highest amount 
required from time-to-time by any stock-exchange 
on which any of the shares are listed, of the issued 
share entitled to vote on the matter at such meeting 
shall be a quorum. Increased quorum requirements 
apply for the passing of certain resolutions 
requisitioned by shareholders or the resolution to 
elect, suspend or remove a Director.
Each shareholder present in person at a General 
Meeting shall be entitled to vote on any question to 
be decided on a show of hands or by a count of votes 
received in the form of electronic record (including 
by proxy), and each shareholder present in person or 
by proxy shall be entitled on a poll to vote for each 
share held by them. Each share carries one vote at a 
General Meeting. The AGM is the ideal opportunity 
for shareholders and the Board to interact. At an 
AGM, shareholders can ask questions directly. 
The 2024 AGM was held on 13 June 2024. During this 
AGM, all proposals on the agenda were adopted. The 
proposals adopted by the General Meeting related to 
the declaration of the final dividend, the 
Remuneration report, the re-election of Jan van 
Kuijk, the election of Owain Lloyd, the authority to 
issue shares, the authority to exclude or limit 
preemptive rights, the authority to purchase own 
shares and the re-appointment of the external 
auditor.
The Company's next AGM is scheduled to be held on 
13 June 2025. More information will become available 
on our website in due course.
Alteration of the Bye-Laws
The Bye-Laws may be revoked or amended only by 
the Board, which may from time-to-time revoke or 
amend them in any way by a resolution of the Board 
passed by a majority of the Directors then in office 
and eligible to vote on that resolution, but no such 
revocation or amendment shall be operative unless 
and until it is approved at a subsequent general 
meeting of the Company by the Shareholders by 
Resolution passed by a majority of votes cast.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Bye-Laws, the 
Company may only allot or issue shares, or grant 
rights to subscribe for shares (other than treasury 
shares) as authorized by a shareholders’ resolution 
and within the limits of such authorization, which 
authorization cannot be withdrawn, unless 
determined otherwise at the time of the adoption of 
the resolution. 
During the 2024 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Board to issue common shares or to 
grant rights to subscribe for common shares up to 
and including 13 December 2025 for up to 10% of the 
total number of shares issued at the time of the 
General Meeting for any purposes. Any issuance 
exceeding this limit needs separate approval by the 
General Meeting.
In addition, the General Meeting renewed the 
authority of the Board to exclude or limit applicable 
preemptive rights when issuing common shares or 
granting rights to subscribe for common shares up 
to and including 13 December 2025.
At our 2025 AGM, the Board intends to request that 
the General Meeting renews its authorization to issue 
common shares or to grant rights to subscribe for 
common shares for up to 10% of the total number of 
shares issued at the time of the 2025 AGM for any 
purposes.
Purchase and cancellation of shares
The Board may, after prior authorization by 
shareholders’ resolution and within the limits of such 
authorization, authorize the purchase by the 
Company of its own shares upon such terms as the 
Board may in its discretion determine, provided

always that such purchase is effected in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act. Subject to 
the provisions of the Bye-Laws, any shares of the 
Company held by the Company as treasury shares 
shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may hold 
all or any of the shares, dispose of or transfer all or 
any of the shares for cash or other consideration, or 
cancel all or any of the shares.
During the 2024 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Board to purchase shares in the 
capital of the Company, either through purchase on 
a stock exchange or otherwise, up to and including 13 
December 2025, under the following conditions: (i) 
the repurchase may constitute up to 10% of the total 
number of shares issued at the time of the General 
Meeting, (ii) provided that the Company will not hold 
more shares in treasury than 10% of the issued share 
capital and (iii) at a price (excluding expenses) not 
less than the nominal value of the shares and not 
higher than the opening price on Euronext 
Amsterdam on the day of repurchase plus 10%. 
On 22 July 2022, Flow Traders announced a €25 
million share repurchase plan, which was 
subsequently increased with €15 million as 
announced on 27 October 2022, thereby resulting in 
an aggregate €40 million share repurchase plan. On 
28 July 2023 it was further announced that the 
period of execution for the €15 million share 
repurchase increase would be extended by 12 
months to 26 October 2024. Share repurchases for a 
total consideration of €11.8 million were made during 
the year ended 31 December 2024 and thus 
completing our share repurchase plan. 
At the 2025 AGM, the Board intends to propose to 
the General Meeting to renew its authorization to 
repurchase shares in the Company.

No dedicated take-over protection structures

preference shares, depository receipts or call options 
issued to vehicles conducive to protecting the 
Company’s interest or independence.
Compliance with the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code
The Board values and considers the interests of the 
various stakeholders involved. Good corporate 
governance results in effective decision-making in a 
manner which enhances shareholder value and 
enables a company to maintain a culture of integrity, 
transparency, and trust. Flow Traders has a           
long- standing focus on a sustainable long-term 
value creation strategy, culture and risk. As a 
Company governed by Bermudan laws, the Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code is not directly applicable 
to Flow Traders Ltd., however, the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code continues to be one of the guiding 
resources for Flow Traders Ltd.'s corporate 
governance related practices. As the Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code is not directly applicable 
to Flow Traders Ltd., it is not intended that Flow 
Traders Ltd. will report on any possible deviations 
from the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

Board in control statement
The Executive Directors are responsible for the 
design, implementation and functioning of Flow 
Traders’ internal risk management and control 
systems. Flow Traders’ internal risk management and 
control is a process, effectuated by the Executive 
Directors, senior management and other personnel. 
It is designed to mitigate risks and provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of 
objectives in the following categories:
▪
Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
▪
Reliability of financial and non-financial 
information; 
▪
Compliance with laws, regulations and internal 
policies; 
▪
Safeguarding of assets, identification and 
management of liabilities; and
▪
Strategic goals of the Flow Traders Group.
The chapter Risk management elaborates on Flow 
Traders’ identified financial and non-financial risks 
and how these risks are managed. This chapter 
provides insight into the impact of these risks on our 
results. The design and functioning of the internal 
risk management and control systems is based on 
the ERMF. The framework explained in detail in the 
chapter Risk management, combines various 
financial and non-financial risk disciplines into a 
single converged approach and provides the 
business with an overview on their risks and how 
these are managed. The Risk department assessed 
the controls in this process and the findings have 
been presented to the Executive Directors and Non-
Executive Directors. This allows the Executive 
Directors and leadership to form a view on the 
internal risk management and control systems 
regarding the risks they face while pursuing 
Company’s strategy.
On the basis of the above and with due observance 
of the limitations stated below, we confirm that to 
the best of our knowledge:
▪
The Annual Report provides sufficient insights 
into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems (see e.g. 
chapter Risk management);
▪
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial and tax reporting 
does not contain any material inaccuracies;
▪
Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justified that the financial 
reporting is prepared on a going concern basis 
(see e.g. chapters Financial statements and Other 
information); and
▪
The report states material risks (if any) and 
uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation 
of the Company’s continuity for the period of 
twelve months after the preparation of the report 
(see e.g. chapters Our strategy and Our risk 
management).
The above does not imply that these systems and 
procedures provide absolute assurance to Flow 
Traders as to the realization of financial and strategic 
business objectives, or that internal risk 
management and control systems can prevent or 
detect all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud 
and noncompliance with legislation, rules and 
regulations.

Message from the Chairman
Dear Stakeholders,
I would like to begin by expressing my sincere 
gratitude to our shareholders for their ongoing 
support and openness to engage in meaningful 
dialogue with our Board. This year, we had the 
privilege of discussing several key topics central to 
Flow Traders’ growth and diversification strategies. 
These engagements are vital in fostering 
constructive conversations that help shape our 
shared vision for the Company’s future.
In 2024, the Board remained focused on its 
commitment to supporting our leadership team as 
they worked to deliver tangible proof points of our 
strategy. In our advisory and consultative capacity, 
we provided guidance on several pivotal initiatives 
that accelerated Flow Traders’ growth over the past 
year. These included the introduction of the Trading 
Capital Expansion Plan and the associated 
suspension of dividends, fostering a culture of risk 
awareness and collaboration, and strengthening our 
leadership team with the appointment of Owain 
Lloyd as CTO.
Marking 20 years 
Most importantly, 2024 marked Flow Traders’ 20th 
anniversary as a trading firm, a remarkable milestone 
in our journey. From our beginnings as an ETP 
trading house, we have evolved into a global leader 
in liquidity provision, driving innovation and 
transparency across financial markets worldwide. 
This achievement is a testament to the exceptional 
talent within our team and the invaluable 
partnerships we have cultivated over the years.
As we reflect on the past and look ahead, we remain 
dedicated to advancing our mission to make 
financial markets more transparent, efficient, and 
accessible. On behalf of the Board, I extend my 
heartfelt thanks to all who have contributed to Flow 
Traders’ success so far. Together, we will continue to 
shape the future of financial markets.
Engagement with Flow Traders’ team
As a Board, we had the privilege of visiting our team 
in New York, an experience that was particularly 
impactful for each of us. This visit provided a fantastic 
opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the 
business, connect with the team, and acquire 
valuable insights into our Americas operations.
These learnings, combined with our regular 
engagements during Board meetings, where we 
interact with leaders across Trading, Technology, and 
Business Support, enhance our ability to serve the 
organization effectively as Non-Executive Board 
members.
Strong business performance
Flow Traders recorded a record fourth quarter in 
2024 and second-best year in terms of financial 
performance in our 20-year history. As a result of the 
overall increase in market activity over the year, we 
recorded net trading income of €467.8 million and 
net profit of €159.5 million for the financial year 2024, 
which was well above our financial performance in 
the prior year.
Strategic priorities and initiatives
During our 2024 AGM, we shared the core four pillars 
of the Flow Traders’ strategy, and outlined actions to 
deliver into these pillars. 
Capital is the lifeblood of trading and in 2Q, we 
announced our Trading Capital Expansion Plan. This 
strategic move was aimed at strengthening our 
capital base in order to leverage opportunities in the 
market. The team has demonstrated the success of 
this initiative by delivering a strong financial 
performance and immediately extracting value from 
the expanded capital base. 
We continued to demonstrate our ability to leverage 
and expand proprietary infrastructure, with a 
strategic focus on China and the broader APAC 
region. These efforts have strengthened our 
operations and network, positioning us for sustained 
growth in the future.
Our commitment to technology and innovation was 
further bolstered by the election of Owain Lloyd as 
CTO. With his expertise and leadership, we are 
confident in our ability to advance our technology 
stack and enhance our capabilities, driving 
continued progress and innovation across the global 
financial landscape. 
Throughout 2024, Flow Traders Strategic Capital 
continued to build strong relationships, with a 
particular highlight being AllUnity, our partnership 
with DWS and Galaxy Digital.

The journey ahead
2025 is poised to deliver a wealth of opportunities, 
and Flow Traders is well-positioned to capitalize on 
them. With a strengthened capital base, a clear 
growth and diversification strategy, and a talented 
team ready to execute, we are prepared to play a 
pivotal role in shaping the future of global financial 
markets.
The continued rise of digital assets, the expansion of 
ETPs, and the advancement of transparent 
regulation all align with our Company’s strengths, 
setting the stage for an exciting year ahead.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my 
heartfelt gratitude to all our employees for their 
significant contributions and unwavering dedication 
throughout the year. As a Board, we are confident 
that together, we will make 2025 another successful 
and memorable year for our business.

The Board's focus in 2024
During 2024, the Board held ten formal Board 
meetings and met several times without holding a 
formal meeting. Examples of meetings without 
holding a formal meeting include a preparation 
session for the AGM, education and strategy days 
and the self-assessment day. During these meetings 
a variety of topics were discussed, including but not 
limited to the following:
Strategy 
The Board remained focused on sustainable long-
term value creation, taking into account the 
strategy’s implementation and feasibility, the 
business model applied by the Company and the 
market in which the business operates, opportunities 
and risks for the Company and the Company’s 
operational and financial goals. They also consider 
the future impact of the Company’s position in 
relevant markets, stakeholder interests, and any 
other aspects relevant to the Company and its 
business, such as the environment, social and 
employee-related matters, the value chain within 
which the business operates and fighting corruption 
and bribery.
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the Company’s risk assessment processes 
and the monitoring of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems continued to be a 
priority and joint responsibility of the Board and all 
committees throughout the year 2024. The review 
entailed an overview of all relevant risks the 
Company is exposed to, the internal controls in place 
to address these risks, and the Board’s view on such 
risks.
Financial results
The Board was updated on the Company’s financial, 
legal and compliance risks through the Audit 
Committee and the Risk & Sustainability Committee. 
Other topics discussed were the annual, half-yearly 
and quarterly results. 
Off-site
The Board met for a three-day off-site meeting in the 
Flow Traders New York office. During this off-site, the 
Board concentrated on gaining insights into and 
interacting with the U.S. operations, which involved 
engaging with local leadership and essential 
ecosystem partners. The sessions held provided the 
Board with an opportunity to learn more about 
business development in the region, trading, and 
Flow Traders’ value proposition in the U.S.
Remuneration and variable compensation of 
Executive Directors and employees
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee 
updated the Board on remuneration and variable 
compensation plans for both employees and the 
Executive Directors. The Executive Directors did not 
participate in the deliberations and decision-making 
concerning their own remuneration. 
Sustainability
Through the Risk & Sustainability Committee, we 
intensified our focus on sustainability, we continue to 
monitor developments in relation to the adoption of 
the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) within Dutch legislation and the implications 
of the European Commissions’ Omnibus 
Announcement in February 2025.
As part of our ESG efforts, we conducted a detailed 
DMA to assess both the financial impacts of 
sustainability risks and the environmental and social 
impacts of our operations. The findings were 
integrated into the deliberations of the Risk & 
Sustainability Committee.
The Internal Audit function (IA)
The recommendations of the IA function, the 
functioning of the IA function and the progress of the 
2024 Internal Audit Plan have been discussed and 
followed up during 2024.
Board evaluation
In November 2024, the Non-Executive Directors self-
evaluated their functioning and performance as a 
group as well as for the Board’s committees and for 
the individual Non-Executive Directors. In 
preparation, input was collected by way of an 
extensive questionnaire from the individual Non-
Executive Directors, from the Executive Directors and 
from key employees with regular access to the Board 
and/or its committees. The Non-Executive Directors 
discussed this input and reflected on the insights 
provided.
Based on the input and their own assessment of the 
skills matrix, the Non-Executive Directors concluded 
that they bring sufficient diversity in experience and 
competencies to collectively be able to ensure a 
proper and effective governance for the Company. 
Also the composition and effectiveness of the Board 
committees was positively assessed.

## Page 66

The Non-Executive Directors identified the following 
key themes requiring continued attention in order to 
further strengthen the effectiveness of the Non-
Executive Directors and of the Board as such going 
forward: 
▪
Global visibility and exposure of the Board vis-a-
vis employees
▪
Structural learning and development of Board 
members, particularly regarding fast-evolving 
asset classes like digital assets
▪
Clear delineation of roles and responsibilities 
between Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors
▪
Board and committee meeting hygiene factors
The 2024 Non-Executive Director self-assessment 
also included an independence-assessment which 
was led by Rudolf Ferscha as Chairman of the Board 
and Linda Hovius as Chairwoman of the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee. As a 
result of this independence-assessment, the Non-
Executive Directors reconfirmed the independence 
of Rudolf Ferscha, Linda Hovius, Delfin Rueda, Paul 
Hilgers and Karen Frank. Jan van Kuijk was 
considered a Non-Independent Director.
The Executive Directors also evaluated their own 
functioning and performance as a group and 
individually. In the 2024 Executive Director self-
assessment, the focus was on the dynamics between 
and the functioning of the CEO, CFO and CTO, and 
further strengthening the joint strategic vision of the 
Executive Directors as a leadership team. It was 
further concluded that the capabilities and 
competencies of the Executive Directors are highly 
complementary to each other, especially with Owain 
Lloyd being elected as CTO as per the 2024 AGM and 
being in charge of driving the Company’s strategic 
direction with respect to all technology related 
matters.
The performance of the Executive Directors was 
discussed among the Non-Executive Directors, and 
with each Executive Director individually, on at least 
two separate occasions throughout the year. For a 
detailed overview of the performance reviews and 
the means by which these were conducted, 
reference is made to the Remuneration report as 
included in this Annual Report.

Committees
During the financial year 2024, the Board operated four committees: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, the Trading & Technology 
Committee, and the Risk & Sustainability Committee. For more information on the functioning and on the responsibilities of the committees, please refer to the chapter 
Corporate governance.
The committees reported to the Board by sharing 
their advice and recommendations during Board 
meetings and by providing an update of the 
deliberations. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee met nine times in 2024. Other 
attendees besides the committee members included 
the CEO, CFO, CTO, the Global Head of Finance, the 
Head of Investor Relations, the Global Head of 
Internal Audit, the Global Head of Tax, the Global 
Head of Risk and Compliance and the external 
auditor.
During these meetings, the Audit Committee 
discussed the annual results, the half-yearly results 
and the quarterly results. Other topics discussed 
include e.g. significant new and proposed legislative 
initiatives related to accounting, auditing and 
financial reporting, tax planning, tax strategy and 
monitoring, assessing whether there were significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal 
control over financial reporting, the Company’s 
financing strategy and Capital Management Policy 
(including dividend proposals), assessing the 
Company’s compliance with rules and regulations, 
the Company’s Code of Conduct and the methods 
used to assess the effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit processes. Topics discussed with the 
external auditor included the financial statements 
over the financial year 2023, recommendations on 
the basis of the Annual Report, their audit plan for 
the financial year 2024 and their interim review 
report. The Audit Committee reviewed the 
management letter and recommendations included 
in the auditor’s report, as issued by the external 
auditor and discussed the actions taken by 
leadership to address any recommendations and 
observations. The Audit Committee evaluated the 
performance of the external auditor and discussed 
this with the Board and subsequently with the 
external auditor. In light of this, the Audit Committee 
advised the Board about the reappointment of the 
external auditor for the reporting years 2024 and 
2025, before the Board determined EY's nomination 
for the appointment of the external auditor to the 
General Meeting. Given the nature of our business, 
the application of information and communication 
technology by the Company, including risks relating 
to cyber security, are discussed in detail in the 
Trading & Technology Committee. Subsequently, key 
items in respect of these items are also discussed in 
the Audit Committee.
External auditor
The Audit Committee and the Executive Directors 
reported to the full Board on EY’s functioning as the 
external auditor, the Company’s relationship with the 
external auditor, on its fees, as well as on other audit 
and non-audit services it provided to the Company. 
EY performed a review of the Company’s interim 
financial statements and issued an unqualified 
review report. The Audit Committee evaluated the 
qualifications, performance and independence of EY, 
taking into account the opinions of the Executive 
Directors. The Audit Committee also obtained a 
report from the external auditor regarding, among 
other topics, its internal quality control procedures. 
EY confirmed its independence from Flow Traders in 
accordance with the professional standards 
applicable to it. Based on the information provided 
by the Audit Committee, the Board nominated EY as 
external auditor for the reporting years 2024 and 
2025 at the Company’s General Meeting in 2024. 
Subsequently, EY was reappointed by the General 
Meeting as external auditor for the reporting years 
2024 and 2025.
The Internal Audit (IA) function 
The IA function carried out all audits that were due 
per the 2024 Internal Audit plan, as approved by the 
Board in October 2023. Focus areas in the 2024 
Internal Audit plan included amongst others trading, 
risk management, IT systems and adherence to 
regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee and 
the Global Head of Internal Audit discussed the 
internal audit results from 2024 (findings, 
observations, recommendations, management 
feedback and follow-up). In October 2024, the Board 
approved an updated version of the Internal Audit 
Charter and approved the risk-based multi-year 
Internal Audit Plan for the years 2025-2027. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee maintains regular 
dialogue with the Global Head of Internal Audit, 
particularly in relation to ongoing audits and 
outstanding audit items. More information can be 
found in the chapter Corporate governance.
Risk & Sustainability Committee
The Risk & Sustainability Committee met five times in 
2024. Invitees to the meeting were the Executive 
Directors, the Global Head of Risk and Compliance 
and the Global Head of Tax. The main focus in these 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

## Page 68

meetings were (i) the Executive Directors’ risk 
assessment, (ii) the firm’s execution of its compliance 
and regulatory frameworks (iii) and the firm’s initial 
ESG efforts. The attendees discussed in detail the 
relevant risks the Company is exposed to, the internal 
controls in place to address these risks, the Executive 
Directors’ views on such risks, as well as the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
internal risk management and control system. More 
information can be found in the chapter Corporate 
governance. 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee met 
seven times in 2024. Other attendees besides the 
Committee members included the CEO, the CFO 
and the Global Head of HR and Recruitment. During 
these meetings the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee regularly discussed the Company culture 
in general including but not limited to the results of 
the annual employee engagement survey and any 
follow-up actions resulting out of such survey. The 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee further 
discussed the Employee Remuneration Policy, made 
proposals to the Board with respect to the the 
remuneration of the individual Executive Directors. 
The size, composition, functioning and succession 
planning of the Board was reviewed including any 
findings and conclusions. Other duties included the 
monitoring of developments in rules and regulations 
in relation to remuneration policies and the 
preparation of the Remuneration report. Before 
determining the remuneration of the individual 
Executive Directors, the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee took note of the individual 
Executive Director’s views with regard to the amount 
and structure of their own remuneration.
Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee met six times 
in 2024. As the core business of the Company is 
discussed in this committee, all of the Non-Executive 
Directors formed part of the Trading & Technology 
Committee. Invitees to the meeting were the 
Executive Directors, Global co-Heads of Trading and 
the Global co-Heads of Technology. The committee 
addressed trading topics including but not limited to, 
trading performance across all specific asset classes 
and regions including KPI tracking, trading 
strategies, market conditions and capital 
management. The Trading & Technology Committee 
also addressed technology topics, including but not 
limited to technology strategies, information 
security, and developments with respect to rules and 
regulations concerning the Company’s technology 
operations, e.g. DORA. 
Non-Executive Directors 
During the year 2024, two meetings were held 
among the Non-Executive Directors, without the 
Executive Directors being present. Both meetings 
were related to the profit share allocation to the 
Executive Directors, which, in accordance with the 
Board Rules and the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy, is a matter reserved for the Non-Executive 
Directors. In January 2024, the Non-Executive 
Directors discussed and approved the final 2023 
profit share allocation to the Executive Directors, and 
in December 2024, the Non-Executive Directors 
discussed the preliminary 2024 profit share allocation 
to the Executive Directors.
Financial statements
The 2024 financial statements were prepared by the 
Board. They were discussed with the Audit 
Committee, in attendance of EY. The financial 
statements were audited by EY, who issued an 
unqualified auditor’s report. Reference is made to the 
auditor’s report of the financial statements. The 
Board approved the financial statements as audited 
by EY. We invite the General Meeting to adopt the 
financial statements for 2024.
Information on the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors can be found in the Remuneration report.

Board composition
Changes throughout 2024 
The sole change to the composition of the Board
during the financial year 2024 was the election of
Owain Lloyd as CTO and Executive Director
per 13 June 2024.
Rotation Schedule
Any changes in the composition of the Board require 
careful consideration from a succession planning 
perspective. In making nominations to the General 
Meeting of Shareholders for the election of directors 
to the Board, the Board tries to mitigate the potential 
future risk of directors simultaneously retiring. The 
Board rotation schedule, which gives a clear insight 
into each director's term(s) is available our website.
Gender diversity within the Board 
We aim to incorporate diversity aspects such as 
nationality, age, gender, educational background or 
professional background into decision making 
concerning the composition of our workforce. 
Regardless of rules and regulations, we see diversity 
as a means to guarantee a safe and inclusive 
environment for our employees and to optimize 
balanced decision making. To the extent possible, 
these aims also apply to the composition of our 
Board. The current composition of the Board is 
diverse in terms of gender, nationality and expertise, 
and has a suitable level of experience in the financial, 
economic, trading, technology, social and legal 
aspects of a Company like ours. Specifically with 
respect to gender diversity within the Board, we have 
set the following goals: (i) to have at least 1/3 female 
and 1/3 male Non-Executive Directors and (ii) at least 
one female and at least one male Executive Director. 
During the year 2024 we were able to continue 
meeting our gender diversity goals, as is reflected in 
the following table.

Letter from the Chairwoman 2024  
Dear Stakeholders,
On behalf of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, I am pleased to present our 2024 
Remuneration report. This report includes a 
summary of our Remuneration Policy currently in 
place and the remuneration paid out in 2024 in 
accordance with this policy. In relation to the 
allocated remuneration for 2024, this was aligned to 
Flow Traders’ strong financial performance, including 
a record fourth quarter in 2024 and second-best year 
in terms of financial performance in the firm’s 20-
year history. To provide context, as a result of the 
overall increase in market activity over the year, we 
recorded net trading income of €467.8 million and 
net profit of €159.5 million for the financial year 2024, 
which was well above our financial performance in 
the prior year. These results are aligned with the KPI 
scorecard and formed the basis for the remuneration 
distributed for the financial year 2024. The Non-
Executive Directors, in close consultation with, and 
supported by, the Executive Directors have decided 
that the 2024 firm-wide variable remuneration pool 
is €87 million (2023: €34.7 million), corresponding to 
32.5% of operating result in 2024. 
Competition for talent
Talented professionals, especially those with 
expertise relevant to Flow Traders, are in short 
supply. To stay ahead of the competition, we 
prioritize attracting, retaining, and developing top 
talent. That is why we have strengthened our talent 
pipeline and enhanced our remuneration 
frameworks to align with our ambitious talent goals. 
In 2024, we developed and implemented revised 
salary frameworks and increased transparency in the 
distribution of our profit-sharing scheme in an effort 
to further improve our position as an employer of 
choice. 
A stronger technology team
A key element in building strong, engaged teams is 
appointing the right leaders. In 2024, we were thrilled 
to welcome Owain Lloyd as our CTO. With his 
extensive expertise and proven track record in critical 
areas such as quantitative systems, automation, and 
scaling technology infrastructure, Owain brings the 
leadership and vision needed to drive our technology 
function forward.
His appointment marks an exciting step in our 
continued growth. Since joining the firm, Owain has 
already made a significant positive impact by 
strengthening the core Technology leadership team 
as well as improving cross-functional collaboration. 
We look forward to the continued impact he will 
make as we advance our mission and strengthen our 
capabilities. 
Fostering culture
The Flow Traders Board members, and specifically 
the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, 
remain committed throughout the year in 
supporting initiatives that foster engagement and 
strengthen the firm’s entrepreneurial culture.
In 2024, the Executive Directors, supported by the 
broader leadership team, developed and executed 
regional engagement plans aimed at enhancing key 
focus areas such as team collaboration, 
communication, and strategic transparency. 
Additionally, members of the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee engaged directly with 
employees to build connections and gain valuable 
insights. These interactions enable us, as Non-
Executive Board members, to provide informed 
guidance and support to the organization, ensuring 
we continue to drive growth and innovation.

2024 remuneration for the Executive Directors of the Board
The remuneration (and other arrangements) for the Executive Directors is 
determined by the Non-Executive Directors of the Board (following proposals 
from the Remuneration & Appointment Committee). The Non-Executive Directors 
have assessed the remuneration of the Executive Directors based on their 
performance - both individual and as a team- and in accordance with Company 
performance in 2024. A detailed explanation of the assessment is included in the 
Performance assessment section of this Annual Report.
Total remuneration
The table below shows the total remuneration awarded to individual Executive 
Directors in 2024. Flow Traders recorded a record fourth quarter in 2024 and 
second-best year in terms of financial performance in our 20-year history. The 
firm-wide variable remuneration pool in 2024 represents 32.5% of the operating 
result, in line with the existing Remuneration Policy. In line with the proposed cap 
on total remuneration in the 2024 Remuneration Policy, the hard cap on total 
remuneration for each Executive Director in 2024 is €4.8 million. The cap is based 
on average employee total pay of €239.8k, calculated according to the 
recommendation of the Dutch Monitoring Commission.

Base salary
In 2024, Owain Lloyd joined the firm as CTO and 
member of the Flow Traders Board. Alongside Mike 
Kuehnel (CEO) and Hermien Smeets-Flier (CFO), our 
Executive Directors receive an annual base salary of 
€300,000. This modest base salary is in line with our 
remuneration philosophy, which heavily relies on 
variable remuneration based on positive Company 
performance.
Variable remuneration
The design of our variable remuneration reflects our 
remuneration principles. We operate a single 
incentive plan that drives and rewards both annual 
and long-term performance with a significant focus 
on the long-term through the multi-year pay-out 
mechanism and half of the award being paid in Flow 
Traders equity. The value of the equity is directly 
linked to performance of the Flow Traders’ share 
price from the date of grant to vesting. Further, any 
outstanding variable remuneration (deferred or 
unvested) remains at risk in full for future years. In 
line with our guiding principles, the Executive 
Directors share in the same firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool as all other employees. This pool 
of variable remuneration is primarily a function of 
operating results. While this structure is uncommon 
among listed companies, it is in line with the practice 
in our industry among both listed and non-listed 
peer companies, and necessary to be able to attract, 
retain and motivate individuals of the highest caliber.
Executive Directors performance assessment
To determine the Executive Directors’ variable 
remuneration awards, the Non-Executive Directors 
conduct a holistic assessment of the performance of 
each Executive Director and the Executive Directors 
as a whole in accordance with a defined scorecard. In 
this holistic performance assessment, the Non-
Executive Directors consider performance against 
Company targets, which have a weight of 70% of 
their variable compensation and include both 
financial and sustainability KPIs. To ensure a 
balanced assessment, our KPIs do not have pre-
determined weightings, allowing the Remuneration 
& Appointment Committee to determine the overall 
outcome and ensure appropriateness in wider 
circumstances. Objectives for the KPIs included in 
the scorecard are set prior to the beginning of the 
year and where appropriate quantitative targets are 
predefined to ensure the assessment is robust. 
Individual performance is assessed alongside 
Company performance with a 30% weighting to 
determine the final variable compensation 
outcomes. Below we present the Company KPIs and 
the explanation on the performance assessment as 
conducted for 2024. Total remuneration amounts are 
formally capped for any individual Executive Director 
of the Board at 20 times the average FTE total 
remuneration.
Performance assessment
The Company performance scorecard is focused on 
six specific performance criteria. The criteria were 
chosen to align with our business, our strategy and 
include a range of financial and sustainability 
metrics. During 2024 similar Company performance 
criteria were applied as in 2023 (with a change in the 
Normalized EBITDA margin to EBITDA margin), with 
a weighting of 70%. The remaining 30% is based on 
individual performance metrics. 
The criteria were set ahead of the performance 
period, ensuring that the achievement of targets is 
challenging, and were as follows:
1. Median daily net trading income (NTI) 
normalized for volatility:
We believe that the median daily NTI normalized by 
volatility provides a statistically clean picture of 
overall business growth. The distribution of daily NTI 
is not normally distributed but more shaped like a 
Poisson or Gamma distribution with a few negatives 
days and more higher profitability days. Due to the 
fact that the higher profitability days are 
independent, a simple average of daily NTI is 
statistically less relevant than the median of the daily 
NTI. It is Flow Traders’ ambition to increase this 
median NTI for equal volatility scenarios. Therefore, it 
is necessary to normalize the observed daily NTI by 
the volatility. Since volatility does not have a linear 
effect, but a moderately exponential impact, it has 
been determined that the most appropriate 
calculation option is to divide the daily median NTI by 
the square root of the volatility. This exercise has 
been performed on our historical results and the 
average VIX value has been used to normalize the 
NTI. It is important to note that for a business with a 
global footprint which is exposed to multiple 
different asset classes, VIX is a simplified proxy for 
overall volatility (VIX is the implied volatility of the 
S&P500). However, it does provide a measure of 
general market sentiment. 
The target value set by the Company is to have this 
metric increase by 10 points every year which equals 
an increase of approximately €50,000 per trading 
day. The target for this metric was set at 247 for 2024 
and Flow Traders achieved an actual result of 350.
2. EBITDA margin 
EBITDA margin is a profitability ratio that measures 
how much in earnings a company is generating 
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, 
as a percentage of the total income.
The target for this metric was set at 34.3% for 2024, 
this is reflective of prior annual outcomes and is at a 
level which ensures a sustainable and growing 
business for all internal and external stakeholders. 
Flow Traders achieved an actual result of 45%.

## Page 75

The criteria of this metric was changed from 
Normalized EBITDA margin to EBITDA margin 
during the 2024 performance year. 
3. Return on average shareholders' equity
The return on average shareholders' equity shows 
how much money is returned to our shareholders as 
a percentage of the money that has been invested or 
retained in Flow Traders. It is calculated by dividing 
Flow Traders net profit for the year by the average 
total shareholders' equity for the year (i.e., the 
average of the opening and closing shareholders' 
equity balances, expressed as a percentage). 
The target for this metric was set at 20% for 2024, 
which is an approximation of Flow Traders’ cost of 
equity and steers towards delivering a return on 
shareholders' equity that is greater than the 
Company’s cost of equity. Flow Traders achieved an 
actual result of 24%. 
4. Business development 
It is an ongoing goal of the Company to further grow 
and diversify our trading activities each year, 
particularly in the context of the broader market 
volumes. We revised the business development KPI 
in the previous year to more closely align with the 
Company’s stated growth and diversification agenda,  
with four components contributing to this KPI. An 
important component of our trading is off-exchange 
with institutional counterparties and the value 
traded per active counterparty helps to measure the 
development in this area. As we diversify our trading 
into different asset classes, the net trading income 
we derive from fixed income, commodities, FX and 
digital assets as a portion of total net trading income 
measures the growing diversification of the business. 
In a similar vein, the net trading income we derive 
from the Americas and APAC as a portion of total net 
trading income measures the growth of the business 
outside of our European market. And lastly, our own 
ETP value traded compared to the market ETP value 
traded measures our share of the overall market. 
This business development score provides a relative 
score based on an algorithm comprised of several 
input levers including the number of active 
counterparties, off-exchange value traded, our net 
trading income by asset class and by region, our own 
ETP value traded and total market ETP value traded. 
At the end of 2024, Flow Traders had over 2,000 
counterparties and off-exchange value traded 
amounted to €518 billion for the year. Fixed income, 
commodities, FX and digital assets accounted for 51% 
of total NTI and the Americas and APAC accounted 
for 44% of total NTI. Flow Traders ETP value traded 
amounted to €1,545 billion and market ETP value 
traded amounted to €47,933 billion.
The target for this metric was set at 1.8 for 2024, given 
these inputs and developments, Flow Traders 
achieved a actual score of 1.72.
5. Compliance awareness score 
The compliance awareness score ensures that the 
incidents raised as part of the Financial & Capital Risk 
and Non-Financial Risk & Compliance Committees 
are reported on a timely basis to the Board. Only 
known incidents are raised to the Board at the time 
of reporting. 
Incident management was successful overall; issues 
were identified and escalated through transparent 
channels. Opportunities remain for improvement 
with respect to implementing cross-departmental 
enhancements and structural solutions rather than 
ad hoc improvements.
Flow Traders achieved a 100% outcome with respect 
to its compliance awareness score which is in line 
with the 2024 target set for the executives. All 
incidents were reported on a timely basis and Flow 
Traders relies on the procedures and training of the 
Compliance and Business teams to ensure any 
breach of obligations are sufficiently escalated and 
acted upon.
6. Engagement score 
This is the average score given by our employees in 
response to the main engagement question in our 
annual global employee engagement survey. 
Engagement is a measure of how committed and 
enthusiastic employees are about their work and the 
organization. When people are engaged, they feel 
more comfortable being themselves at work. 
Different factors contribute to employee 
engagement, including organizational culture, work 
environment, work relationships, and development 
opportunities.
On the engagement score a 7.2 (2023: 7.0) was 
scored, this is 6% below the global target of 7.7 for 
2024. However, the regional scores (EMEA: 7.1, 
Americas: 7.4, APAC: 7.0) were all in line with the 
regional benchmarks.
2024 performance summary
The performance on the Company scorecard in 
combination with the Executive Directors’ individual 
performance have determined the individual variable 
compensation outcome. As mentioned, our KPIs do 
not have further pre-determined weightings, 
allowing the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee to determine the overall outcome and 
ensure appropriateness in overall circumstances. 
While the results of the engagement score and 
business development measures came in below 
target, performance on these metrics was still viewed 
as acceptable, given the market circumstances. The 
rationale for not reaching the targets has been

understood. In addition to the Company 
performance metrics, the individual performance of 
the Executive Directors was also considered in 
setting the variable remuneration levels.
2025 scorecard
The Non-Executive Directors of the Board have 
determined that the six KPIs used to assess 
Executive Director performance in 2024 will be 
retained for the 2025 performance year. The specific 
targets relating to each of these KPIs are 
commercially sensitive and accordingly the target 
ranges and actual performance outcomes achieved 
will be disclosed retrospectively together with 
appropriate commentary in the next Annual Report. 
The weighting of the Company versus individual 
targets will remain at 70% versus 30%.

Deferral and vesting of variable pay
We believe in creating a culture of ownership, risk awareness and entrepreneurial 
spirit and we embrace an approach which truly connects our people to the 
business in sharing profit and risk. To ensure that the variable remuneration award 
of the Executive Directors is aligned with our beliefs and contributes to long-term 
value creation and shareholder experience, 50% of the 2024 award to the 
Executive Directors is paid out in equity deferred over multiple years. This 
approach allows us to take a longer-term outlook on remuneration and the table 
below illustrates the vesting schedule for outstanding awards. All equity-based 
awards are subject to a holding period of one-year post-vesting. The main terms 
and conditions of the awarded shares to Executive Directors are provided in the 
table ‘Executive Directors share-based compensation’. The remaining 50% is 
settled in cash, paid in equal installments in 2025 and 2026. 
The above approach accords with our culture and remuneration philosophy of 
encouraging management and employee share ownership, creating alignment 
with the our long-term success.

Comparative overview of Company performance and remuneration
The long-standing foundation of our Remuneration Policy reflects a relatively 
modest base salary and variable remuneration that is aligned with Company 
performance – which varies each year depending on successful or less successful 
(financial) years. This is clearly illustrated in the table below which shows the 
development of the Company performance and the awarded (full-time) 
remuneration of executives and average employee remuneration over the last   
five years. 
Internal pay ratios
The 2024 pay ratio (CEO total pay vs. average total employee pay) is 7.92 compared 
to 4.33 in 2023. This is well below the cap of 20 times average total employee pay.
Scenario analyses 
The Board carries out yearly scenario analyses when determining the structure 
and level of Executive Director remuneration outcomes, in accordance with the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code. 
This includes the calculation of remuneration under different scenarios, whereby 
different performance assumptions are considered. By considering different 
performance assumptions, the possible outcomes of variable components and the 
resulting impact on the total remuneration of the Executive Directors is 
understood and examined. The Board believes the current remuneration structure 
and outcomes are appropriate and aligned with shareholder experiences. The 
Board will continue to assess the adequacy of the remuneration structure, 
including performance measures used for variable remuneration components.

No pensions, loans and other benefits
In 2024, no personal loans, guarantees or related 
benefits were granted by the Company to the 
members of the Board as part of their compensation 
package. No loans, guarantees or similar instruments 
to the members of the Board were outstanding on 31 
December 2024.
We have not reserved nor accrued any amounts to 
cover pension claims or retirement claims. We do not 
provide any other ancillary benefits for any member 
of the Board.
Clawback variable remuneration
Malus and clawback provisions are in place that are 
comprehensive, irreversible and substantially exceed 
regulatory requirements. No variable remuneration 
has been clawed back during 2024.
Temporary deviations from the 
Remuneration Policy 
No temporary deviations took place from the 
respective policy in 2024. 
Shares held by employees and Executive 
Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, 
creating alignment between the Company’s long-
term success and individual personal financial 
circumstances. Since IPO, we have utilized a number 
of share schemes. In connection with the IPO a 
significant number of current and former employees 
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow 
Traders Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and Flow Traders 
Loyalty Incentive Plan (FLIP) were introduced. The 
FCIP was replaced in 2020 by a new share plan which 
provides for the award up to 50% of variable 
remuneration in shares (or share-like instruments).

2024 remuneration for employees
Variable remuneration
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the 
beginning of each calendar year, clear objectives are 
set, which are in line with our Company objectives. 
Performance is reviewed twice during an annual 
cycle. Individual variable remuneration payable from 
the collective variable compensation pool is 
dependent on Company and business unit 
performance, individual performance and the 
individual’s contribution to the long-term success of 
the Company as a whole, discouraging a culture of 
‘star’ behavior and fostering collaboration and 
teamwork. Flow Traders does not base variable 
remuneration directly on financial results achieved 
individually. The Executive Directors approve the 
awarding of variable remuneration. If awarded, 
variable remuneration is paid in cash, Company 
shares and Company share like instruments in one to 
multiple annual installments, depending on the 
amount of variable remuneration awarded. The 
deferred variable component acts as a first loss 
tranche to compensate for any operating loss in the 
subsequent year, acting as a buffer before such loss 
would impact shareholder equity. This serves as an 
important incentive for risk-aware behavior, focusing 
on the long-term objectives of the Company and 
alignment with our risk appetite. We deem the 
deferral period sufficient given the Company’s risk 
profile and horizon.
▪
Variable remuneration components may become 
subject to reduction or clawback if it is 
determined that the relevant employee did not 
meet adequate norms of competence and 
appropriate behavior or was responsible for 
behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of 
the Company’s position, in accordance with 
applicable law
▪
We do not award guaranteed variable 
remuneration to employees unless the 
guaranteed variable component is awarded in 
relation to hiring new staff, limited to the first year 
of employment, and only if we have a sound and 
strong capital base
▪
We do not award severance payments if there is a 
serious imputable act or negligence by the 
employee in the fulfillment of his or her function 
or where an employee resigns voluntarily (unless 
this is the consequence of a serious imputable act 
or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar handelen of 
nalaten) by the Company)
▪
The Company does not grant its employees any 
personal loans, guarantees or equivalent benefit 
as part of their compensation package. We do not 
provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
employee. We have not reserved or accrued any 
amounts to cover pension claims or retirement 
claims
Emphasizing share ownership
We value ownership, both in terms of mindset, 
behavior as well as a share in the ownership of the 
Company. We believe that being a shareholder aligns 
the interests of the Company with those of our 
employees. Ever since the Company went public and 
before, we have a history of offering our employees 
the opportunity to become shareholders. From 
performance year 2020 onwards, we have begun 
rewarding employees directly in Company shares. 
The higher the variable remuneration an individual 
receives, the higher the proportion of variable 
compensation paid out in shares.
We are also maintaining our FLIP (Flow Loyalty 
Incentive Plan) program, whereby we award 
Company shares to employees marking their two-
year anniversary with the Company. Shares awarded 
under the FLIP are subject to a lock-up period. All 
shares awarded to employees are fully paid out from 
the variable compensation pool. The terms and 
conditions of the employee share plans are subject to 
review by the Executive Directors annually. As a part 
of these plans, shares have been and will be bought 
in the market.
Pension
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. 
At our headquarter in Amsterdam, we partner with a 
pension provider, giving employees the freedom of 
choice to select the option that best suits their 
individual needs while incentivizing participation in 
the Company-sponsored program. In our other 
offices we offer schemes that are driven by country 
specific practices and regulations.
Variable compensation granted
In 2024, the total amount of variable remuneration 
awarded to all employees including the Executive 
Directors was €87 million (2023: €34.7 million). 
In 2024, Company-wide average compensation 
(includes salary, social security costs and variable 
remuneration) paid per average FTE was €239.8K 
(2023: €151.7K), while variable remuneration per 
average FTE amounted to 56.8% (2023: 33.8%) of total 
compensation in 2024. This excludes any Executive 
Director remuneration.

trading income and €0.5 million (2023: €0.3 million) to Other income or expense. The interest received for the period 31 December 2024 is €65.7 million (2023: €77.9

Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1.
Reporting entity
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 are presented in 
euros, which is also the Company’s functional currency and rounded to the 
nearest thousand. Consequently, the rounded amounts may not add up to the 
rounded total in all cases. Flow Traders Ltd. (referred to as the “Company”) is an 
exempted company limited by shares registered under the Companies Act 1981 
of Bermuda, as amended (the “Companies Act”). Flow Traders Ltd. was 
incorporated on 13 January 2023 with its registered office at Canon's Court,          
22 Victoria Street, PO Box HM 179, Hamilton HM 12 Bermuda. The Company's 
principal place of business is located at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 1018 LL 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Flow Traders Ltd. is registered with the Dutch 
Trade Register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 88926257 as a 
company formally registered abroad (“formeel buitenlandse 
kapitaalvennootschap”). This term is referred to in the Dutch Companies 
Formally Registered Abroad Act (“Wet op de formeel buitenlandse 
vennootschappen”), which means the Company is deemed a Dutch resident 
company for corporate reporting purposes in accordance with applicable Dutch 
laws.
These Consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The Company is the ultimate 
parent of the Group.
The Group is a leading technology-enabled global multi-asset class liquidity 
provider with its core business in Exchange Traded Products (ETP) actively 
expanding in fixed income, FX, commodities and digital assets, while 
systemically increasing its presence in the global ecosystem through strategic 
partnerships and investments.
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 
December 2024 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders Ltd. and its 
subsidiaries. The annual financial statements were authorized for issue by the 
Company’s Board on 13 March 2025 subject to adoption by the general meeting 
of shareholders.
2. Predecessor and continuation accounting
a) Changes to corporate structure 
On 13 January 2023, the Group completed the update to its corporate holding 
structure. This followed receipt of shareholder approval at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting held on 2 December 2022 and fulfillment of all regulatory and 
other customary closing conditions. As a result of the update, the Group’s top 
holding company is now Flow Traders Ltd. The updated of the corporate holding 
structure enables Flow Traders to become more competitive as a global liquidity 
provider, particularly in relation to regulatory capital management. 
As part of the change of its corporate holding structure Flow Traders N.V. 
entered into a cross-border legal merger in which (i) all Flow Traders N.V.'s assets, 
liabilities, rights, obligations and other legal relationships were acquired by Flow 
Traders S.A. incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, (ii) Flow Traders N.V. 
ceased to exist and (iii) each Shareholder received one Flow Traders S.A. share for 
each Flow Traders N.V. share. Following this merger Flow Traders S.A. converted 
into a Bermuda limited company and changed its registered address to 
Bermuda. 
The change in the Group's corporate holding structure had no impact on the 
profit and loss or equity of the Company. A predecessor value method is used to 
determine the carrying value of all assets and liabilities that transfer as part of 
the merger. As at 13 January 2023 the assets and liabilities of Flow Traders N.V. 
are consolidated in the financial statements of Flow Traders S.A. at their carrying 
amount on this date, in accordance with the predecessor value method. 
3. Basis of preparation 
a) Statement of compliance
The Group applies IFRS accounting standards as adopted by the European Union 
(‘IFRS Accounting Standards’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS 
Accounting Standards provide several options in accounting principles. The 
Group’s accounting principles and its decisions regarding the options available 
are set out in the section ‘material accounting policies’ below.
b) Going concern basis of accounting
These Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the 
going concern assumption.

## Page 93

c) Functional and presentation currency
These Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the 
functional currency of the parent company, Flow Traders Ltd. All financial 
information presented in euros has been rounded to the nearest thousand, 
except when otherwise indicated.
d) Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of these Consolidated financial statements requires 
management to form opinions and make estimates and assumptions that 
influence the reported value of assets and liabilities and of income and 
expenditure. The actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Information about estimates and judgments made in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the 
Consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: 
▪
Note 8: Fair value measurement
▪
Note 13: Share based payments 
▪
Note 33: Provisions and contingencies
During the current year, the Group further refined their application of estimates 
to the fair value measurement of investments held at fair value through profit or 
loss and through other comprehensive income. These estimates exclusively 
relate to strategic investments in the digital asset sector. This sector continues to 
evolve with increases in market participant sophistication, available investment 
products and historical results. As a result of this evolution, the Group’s 
methodology to form estimates of significant unobservable inputs (see note 8) 
has evolved and changed. The Group has concluded that the effect of this 
change should be accounted for as a change in estimate. Please see note 8h for 
the impact in the current year. The Group has not calculated the effect on future 
periods as estimating the effect on fair value would be impracticable given the 
interdependencies on assumptions, which include active market prices.
e) Principles for the preparation of the Consolidated statement 
of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities are presented in the Consolidated 
statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Cash flows from investing 
activities and financing activities are presented in the Consolidated statement of 
cash flows using the direct method.
The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, investment activities and 
financing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash flow from operating activities. The Group has elected to 
classify interest received and interest paid as cash flows from operating activities 
when generated from principal revenue-producing activities. The Group has 
elected to classify interest paid or received on all other activities as financing 
activities. 
Investment activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in 
respect of financial investments other than in the course of operations, as well as 
acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. 
Financing activities include the payment of dividends to shareholders, the (re)-
purchase of shares, the issuance and repayment of financial debt, including 
financial lease liabilities, and capital contributions.
4.  Restatement of prior period errors
Restatement 1
The Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023 has 
been restated for the effect of incorrect recognition of certain derivative 
contracts. For these contracts only an asset or liability should had been 
recognized depending on the contract’s gain or loss position. However, notional 
amounts have been incorrectly recognized as both assets and liabilities, despite 
not meeting the recognition criteria in IFRS 9. Additionally, these derivative 
contracts were previously presented within trading receivables and trading 
payables and should have been presented as financial assets or liabilities held for 
trading. There was nil impact on the statement of profit or loss and nil impact on 
retained earnings. 
Restatement 2
The Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023 has 
been restated for the effect of incorrect presentation for stablecoins (digital 
assets) as trading receivables and trading payables. Digital assets are presented 
as other assets and liabilities held for trading and accounted for as inventory 
under IAS 2.  Trading receivables and trading payables are financial assets and 
liabilities accounted for under IFRS 9. There was nil impact on the statement of 
profit or loss and nil impact on retained earnings. 
Please see the table below for impact on the Consolidated statement of financial 
position and Consolidated statement of cash flows.

5. Material accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all 
periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
a) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group 
entities. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and 
expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions 
with equity-accounted investments are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in 
the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an 
investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through power over 
the investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
Consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences 
until the date when control ceases.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary it derecognizes the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other 
components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when 
control is lost.
Equity-accounted investments
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but 
not control or joint control, over its financial and operating activities. A joint 
venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the 
Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its 
assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Interests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method and are recognized initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

## Page 95

and OCI of equity-accounted investments, until the date on which significant 
influence or joint control ceases. 
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the 
date control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the 
acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain 
purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are 
expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or equity 
securities. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Any gain or loss resulting from the fair value remeasurement of contingent 
consideration is recognized in profit or loss.
b) Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of 
the respective entities of the Group at exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the 
foreign currency difference being recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising 
on the translation of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income unless 
the instrument is impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items in a foreign currency that are measured based on historical cost are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at 
the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated to euros at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, 
and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of 
equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant 
influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve 
related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain 
or loss on disposal.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with 
maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Group in 
the management of its short-term commitments.
d) Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are 
originated. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and 
sales of financial assets) are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on 
which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or 
minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
▪
trading receivables, measured at amortized cost;
▪
investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;
▪
investments measured at fair value through profit or loss;
▪
financial assets held for trading at fair value through profit or loss; and
▪
other financial assets at amortized costs (Other receivables on the 
Consolidated statement of financial position).
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and 
loan commitments, into the following categories:
▪
trading payables, measured at amortized cost;
▪
financial liabilities held for trading at fair value through profit or loss; and
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

---

## Page 96

▪
other financial liabilities measured at amortized costs (Other liabilities and 
loans and borrowings on the Consolidated statement of financial position).
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading are those assets and liabilities that 
the Group acquires or incurs principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of a portfolio that is managed 
together for short-term profit.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading are initially recognized and 
subsequently measured at fair value in the Consolidated statement of financial 
position, with transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. All changes in fair 
value, along with any interest and dividend income or expense, are recognized as 
part of net trading income in profit or loss. Financial assets and liabilities held for 
trading are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition.
Trading receivables and payables
Such assets and liabilities are recognized initially at fair value minus/plus any 
directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these assets and liabilities 
are measured at amortized cost.
Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)
Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
non-derivative debt and equity investments that the Group considers long-term 
strategic investments. Investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are 
recognized in other comprehensive income as part of the change in fair value at 
the next remeasurement. They are never reclassified into profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair 
value reserve in equity. When an investment is derecognized, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit or loss.
Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)
Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss includes both 
derivative and non-derivative debt and equity investments that the Group holds 
for long term trading purposes. Investments measured at fair value through 
profit or loss are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized 
in the profit or loss as part of the change in fair value, any re-measurement of the 
investments is classified to other income in the statement of profit or loss .
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein, are recognized in profit or loss. When an investment is derecognized, the 
gain or loss is classified to other income in the statement profit or loss.
Other financial assets and liabilities
Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are recognized initially at fair value 
less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method (EIR). The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group 
derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange 
risk associated with its capital contributions to the United States and Singapore 
subsidiaries. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI while any gains or losses relating to 
the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. On 
disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or 
losses recorded in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of 
offset is agreed between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a 
net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under 
IFRS Accounting Standards, for gains and losses arising from a group of similar 
transactions such as in the Group’s trading activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants at 
the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

## Page 97

market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability 
reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an 
active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions 
for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to 
provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition 
is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or 
received. If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs 
from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted 
price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a 
valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the 
financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the 
difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. 
Subsequently, that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate 
basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is 
wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on estimated prices whereby 
the price differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those 
estimated prices can differ from quoted market prices. The Group’s risk and mid-
office department monitors whether all differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the 
Group on the basis of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are 
measured on the basis of a price that would be received to sell a net long 
position or paid to transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure. 
Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of 
the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e) Other assets held for trading
Other assets held for trading comprise the amount of digital assets that the 
Group holds as a broker-trader. The Group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets and 
these are measured at fair value less cost to sell with changes in value 
recognized in profit or loss. 
For the determination of the fair value, the Group collects reference price points 
on an on-going basis from multiple crypto exchanges and other active markets. 
If assets are not actively traded the valuation is based upon quoted prices or 
observable inputs from similar assets.
f) Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When parts of an item 
of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as 
the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount 
of the item) is recognized in Other income or expense in profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
Ongoing repairs and maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in 
profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of each component. 
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant 
items of property and equipment are as follows:
▪
hardware: 5 years;
▪
office fixtures: 5 years;
▪
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the 
lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024   
 
 
 
 
 
96


---

## Page 98

are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized less any lease 
incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. 
Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Right-of-use assets are recorded 
in property and equipment and intangible assets on the Consolidated statement 
of financial position.
g) Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the 
estimated useful lives of each component. The estimated useful life of significant 
intangible assets is 5 years.
h) Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and other 
debt financial assets not held at fair value through profit or loss is based on the 
credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected 
credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk 
since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ 
expected credit loss (12mECL). 
For other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating 
ECLs as these receivables relate to operating activities of the Group. Therefore, 
the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has 
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss 
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment. 
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 
90 days past due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a financial 
asset to be in default when internal or external information indicated that the 
Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before 
taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial 
asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the 
contractual cash flows.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax 
assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized if the 
carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and 
its fair value less cost of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets 
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which 
impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized 
in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investment is measured 
by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying 
amount. An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there 
has been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount.

i)
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under 
short-term cash variable compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of 
past services provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated 
reliably. If the Group incurs a loss in a certain reporting period, there will be no 
obligation to pay the cash variable compensation.
j)
Share based payments
When employees render services as consideration for equity instruments, the 
expense is recognized in employee expenses, together with a corresponding 
increase in equity, both calculated based on the fair value of the instruments 
granted and over the period in which the service conditions are fulfilled (the 
vesting period). The fair value of equity-settled transactions granted to 
employees is determined by the fair value of the shares at the date when the 
grant is made. The awards vest in tranches on various dates over a total period of 
up to five years. Vesting is conditional upon the employee being actively 
employed by the Group on the vesting date. If the employment is terminated or 
if the employee resigns, any unvested tranches of the award will be forfeited. The 
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting 
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest.
The fair value of share appreciation rights (SARs) granted to employees, which 
are cash-settled, is recognized in employee expenses, together with a 
corresponding increase in other liabilities, over the period during which the 
service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The liability is remeasured at 
the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes 
in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Estimates used are reassessed at the end 
of each reporting period. These estimates are based on the fair value of the 
parent entity share price (which does not materially differ from the option price 
model) and consider the extent to which the employees have rendered services 
as at the reporting date as well as the likelihood that the employees will be 
employed by the Group at the vesting date.
k) Other liabilities held for trading 
As part of its trading activities, the Group enters into digital asset payables. The 
borrowed digital assets payables are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Additionally, the Group may borrow digital assets as part of market making 
arrangements. The Group measures these liabilities at fair value. Certain 
arrangements contain options to settle the borrowed digital assets. The Group 
has concluded that the market making arrangements and the options cannot 
be separated and are initially valued at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred and subsequently measured at fair value. The options are valued using 
an option pricing model to which there is a material source of estimation 
uncertainty from estimates of volatility levels (see note 8(a)).
At initial recognition, any difference between the fair value and the transaction 
price is not recognized in profit or loss immediately but is deferred over the life of 
the arrangement, unless the fair value on initial recognition is evidenced by a 
quoted price in an active market or based on valuation techniques to which 
unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant. The difference between 
transaction price and initial fair value which is not yet recognized in profit or loss 
is recognized in other liabilities held for trading on the Consolidated statement 
of financial position. The amount of the deferred profit or loss which has been 
recognized in the current period’s profit or loss is included in the gross trading 
income line on the Consolidated statement of profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income. 
Please see note 8(f) for additional information.
l)
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized 
as finance cost. 
Provisions made in the current year are recognized in the Provisions line item of 
the Consolidated statement of financial position and within Other expenses in 
the Statement of profit or loss. 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

## Page 100

m) Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities on 
the Consolidated statement of financial position measured at the present value 
of lease payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present 
value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date. After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease 
payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a change in the lease term or in case of other 
reassessments or modifications
n) Loans and borrowings
On initial recognition, loans and borrowings are measured at fair value plus or 
minus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using the effective-interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognized in 
profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR 
amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortization is included as finance expense in the statement of profit or loss. 
Please refer to Note 30 for additional information on loans and borrowings.
o) Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial 
expenses related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and 
are therefore directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading 
income.
p) Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax 
are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to a business 
combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive 
income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or 
loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of 
previous years. Current tax payable also includes any withholding tax liability 
arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
their tax bases. Deferred tax is not recognized for:
▪
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
▪
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in 
the foreseeable future; and
▪
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to 
temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into 
account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and 
interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are 
adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, 
including interpretations of tax law and management judgment. This 
assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgment 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause 
the Group to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax 
liabilities or the collectability of tax assets. Such changes will impact tax expense 
in the period that such a change in estimate is made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the 
same tax authority on the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis or the tax assets and liabilities will be realized 
simultaneously.

## Page 101

A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and 
deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date.
q) Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
recognized at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in 
profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own 
equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the 
consideration, if reissued, is recognized in equity.
6. New standards and interpretations 
The Group has assessed all new standards, amendments and interpretations that 
are relevant to its operations and effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2024. These amendments do not have a material impact on the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
Additionally, the new IFRS issued but not yet effective for the 31 December 2024 
include:
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
IFRS 18, which replaces IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, introduces 
new requirements for presentation within the statement of profit or loss, 
including specified totals and subtotals. Furthermore, the Group is required to 
classify all income and expenses within the statement of profit or loss into one of 
five categories: operating, investing, financing, income taxes and discontinued 
operations, whereof the first three are new. 
It also requires disclosure of newly defined management-defined performance 
measures, subtotals of income and expenses, and includes new requirements for 
aggregation and disaggregation of financial information based on the identified 
‘roles’ of the primary financial statements (PFS) and the notes.
In addition, narrow-scope amendments have been made to IAS 7 Consolidated 
statement of Cash Flows, which include changing the starting point for 
determining cash flows from operations under the indirect method, from ‘profit 
or loss’ to ‘operating profit or loss’ and removing the optionality around 
classification of cash flows from dividends and interest. In addition, there are 
consequential amendments to several other standards. 
As of 31 December 2024, EFRAG has not endorsed IFRS 18. IFRS 18 is effective for 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, but earlier application is 
permitted and must be disclosed. IFRS 18 will apply retrospectively. The Group is 
currently working on identifying all impacts the amendments will have on the 
primary financial statements and notes to the financial statements. The Group 
will apply IFRS 18 at the effective date, early adoption is not expected. 
Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of exchangeability 
The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. EFRAG endorsed the amendment on 12 
November 2024 and the amendments are effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2025. 
Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 – Amendments to the Classification and 
Measurement of Financial Instruments

consolidated financial statements. EFRAG endorsed the amendment on 15 May 
2024 and the amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2026. 
IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures
As the Group’s equity instruments are publicly traded, it is not eligible to elect to 
apply IFRS 19. As of 31 December 2024, EFRAG had not endorsed the standard. 
The effective date of IFRS 19 is for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027.
IFRS Annual Improvements Volume 11
All amendments from the IFRS Annual Improvements Volume 11 are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group. As of 31 December 2024,

7. Operating segments
The chief operating decision makers of the Group examine performance from a 
regional perspective and have identified three reportable segments of its global 
trading business: Europe, the Americas and Asia.

Europe consists of activities in the Netherlands with institutional trading 
activities in France, UK, Italy, trading activities in Jersey and internal IT activities 
in Romania. Americas consists of the subsidiaries in the USA. Asia contains our 
subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore and a Chinese representative office in 
Shanghai. The executive directors of the Board consider this segmentation to be 
relevant to understand the Group financial performance because it allows 
investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate 
the operating performance and decision making about allocation of resources 
and trading capital.
The Group measures results on an IFRS basis and reconciles the total segment 
results on net trading income, profit before tax and net profit. Significant 
transactions and balances between geographic regions occur primarily as result 
of Group operating companies incurring the operating expenses such as 
employee compensation, communication, software development and data 
processing and overhead costs for the purpose of providing services to affiliated 
operating companies (line items intercompany recharge income and expenses).
a) Restatement of prior period operating segments disclosure
On review of intercompany recharges, it was concluded that certain 
arrangements were accounted for incorrectly in 2023. As a result, the Group 
evaluated the presentation of its inter-company recharge arrangements in the 
Segment Report tables and have restated the disclosure as of 31 December 2023 
to enhance the understanding of the users of the financial statements of 
reported segmental results. The resulting differences between the restated 
presentation and the previously disclosed presentation are disclosed below. 
The aforementioned changes had no impact on the overall financial position or 
net earnings of the Group.
Additionally, total assets and total liabilities as of 31 December 2023 have been 
restated in-line with the prior period error disclosed in Note 4. The impact to total 
assets and total liabilities was a reduction of €2.3 billion.

(a) Gross trading income for each region was restated to reflect the results 
achieved by regions trading as principal.
(b) The inter-segment revenue and expenses related to trading services, 
represents inter-segmental transactions from trading income earned by regions 
trading in agency capacity from other regions, with a corresponding inter-
segmental expense. Intra-region revenue and expenses are presented on a net 
basis. EMEA’s 2023 intra-region revenue related to trading activities has been 
restated as it was previously presented gross. These lines have previously been 
disclosed in NTI. 
(c) The inter-segment revenue and expenses related to other intercompany 
transactions, represents an accumulation of all intercompany transactions not 
already covered under note (a), resulting in inter-segmental revenues and 
corresponding expenses. Intra-region revenue and expenses are presented on a 
net basis. This line was previously entitled ‘Intercompany recharge’.
(d) Assets for each region have been previously presented net of financial 
liabilities held for trading, Trading payables and Other liabilities held for trading. 
Liabilities for each region have previously not included Financial liabilities held 
for trading, Trading payables and Other liabilities held for trading. Besides this, 
the balance has been restated for the incorrect presentation of FX forwards, 
please refer to note 4, for the this restatement.
8. Fair value measurement
Valuation models 
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement 
that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer 
the liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants 
at the measurement date. 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, 
depending on the inputs used for making the measurements.
▪
Level 1: fair value of financial instruments based upon inputs that are quoted, 
unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical instruments;
▪
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in 
active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are not considered active; or other valuation 
techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable 
from market data;
▪
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments 
for which the valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a 
significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes 
instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments 
but for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are 
required to reflect differences between the instruments, for example unlisted 
equity securities.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active 
markets are based on prices obtained directly from an exchange on which the 
instruments are traded or obtained from a broker that provides an unadjusted 
quoted price from an active market for identical instruments. For all other 
financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation 
techniques.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on 
the basis of net exposures to market risks, it applies judgment in determining 
appropriate portfolio-level adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such 
adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask spreads for similar instruments 
and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. 
Similarly, when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial 
liabilities on the basis of net exposure to the credit risk of a particular 
counterparty, it takes into account any existing arrangements that mitigate the 
credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty).

Implied 
Volatility 
(80%-140%)
If implied volatility were to 
increase, the fair value 
would increase
The discount for lack of marketability is driven by factors which include the 
contractual terms of each investment as well as time elapsed. Due to this, the 
range of DLOMs used as of the reporting date will change year over year to 
reflect the portfolio as of the reporting date.
A reasonably possible alternative assumption to the illiquidity discount is an 
increase or decrease of the percentage by 5% percent (2023: 5%). For investments 
measured at FVPL, this would increase/decrease the total fair value by €1.6 
million (2023: €837k) and for investments measured at FVOCI, this would 
increase/decrease the total fair value by a €621k (2023: €125k). 
A reasonably possible alternative assumption for applying the range of implied 
volatility would be to apply a 120 percent implied volatility for all other liabilities 
held for trading measured using a significant unobservable input of implied 
volatility. This would result in an increase in the total fair value of other liabilities 
held for trading by €172k (2023: €190k). If those instruments were to all have an 
80 percent implied volatility, the impact would be a decrease in the total fair 
value of other liabilities held for trading of €2.5 million (2023: €1.1 million). 
Assuming an increase in fair value of a liability is making it less negative, and a 
decrease in fair value of a liability making it more negative.
b. Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The valuation of trading positions, both long and short positions, is determined 
by reference to last traded prices from identical instruments from the exchanges 
at the reporting date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are 
carried at fair value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted 
market prices. The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused 
by the fact that the Group continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities 
based on all available information. This includes prices for identical and near-
identical positions, as well as the prices for securities underlying the Group’s 
positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on which the 
financial asset or liability is primarily traded closes. Consequently, such financial 
assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to 
determine fair value.
c. Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income is determined by reference to their quoted closing bid 
price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation 
technique and are classified as Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular 
availability of quoted closing bid prices. 
d. Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through profit or loss is 
determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, 
or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique and are classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular availability of quoted closing bid 
prices.

e. Other assets held for trading 
Other assets held for trading comprises the amount of digital assets that the 
Group holds as a broker-dealer. The Group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets and 
these are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Group uses its own 
fair value models based on quoted prices or observable inputs for the valuation 
of the digital assets, these assets are classified as Level 2. 
f.
Other liabilities held for trading
The Group borrows digital assets as part of its trading strategy. The borrowed 
digital assets are measured at fair value less cost to sell. As the Group uses its 
own fair value models based on quoted prices, observable inputs or 
unobservable inputs for the valuation of the borrowed digital assets, these 
liabilities are classified as Level 2 and Level 3. When the borrowed digital assets 
have an embedded derivative (see note 5(k)), the Group values the derivative 
using an option pricing model. See note 8(a) for additional information about the 
significant Level 3 inputs used.

The unrealized gain of €2.6 million (2023: loss of €9.1 million) on other liabilities 
held for trading is included in ‘Gross trading income’ in the Consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
9. Hedge of net investments in foreign operations 
Included in Financial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2024 is a short 
position of USD 8.7 million (2023: USD 19.3 million) which has been designated as 
a hedge of the net investment in the United States and Singapore subsidiaries, 
which have their functional currency in USD. This position is being used to hedge 
the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign exchange risk on this investment. Gains 
or losses on the retranslation of this translation are transferred to other 
comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net 
investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the 
foreign exchange risk on the USD short position. The Group has established a 
hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to 
the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the 
amount of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the 
amount of the short position. The hedging gain recognized in other 
comprehensive income before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for 
measuring effectiveness. There is no ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss.

trading on the Consolidated statement of financial position is as follows:

10.  Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders with the number of ordinary shares outstanding. 
The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted 
average effect of changes in treasury shares (repurchased and re-issued by the 
Group) during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the basic earnings per 
share for the effects of all dilutive share-based payments to employees.

where the fixed costs were presented as variable costs. As such, Wages and 
salaries has increased by €3.7 million, Social security charges have increased by 
€0.3m and Variable compensation paid in cash as decreased by €4.0 million. 
The amount of variable compensation payable is based on the operational profit 
of the Company. Variable compensation costs are based on existing variable 
compensation obligations as well as expected variable compensation for the 
period.
Share-based payments
The Group awards its employees with shares as part of their variable 
compensation and is responsible for withholding wage taxes upon vesting in the

a) Variable remuneration share plans - equity settled
Under the variable remuneration share plans, shares are granted to employees 
as part of their variable compensation. The shares vest in four equal installments 
during the first quarter of the subsequent year over a period of three or four 
years subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on the 
vesting date.
Employees are granted shares based on a fixed monetary value. As part of the 
2024 variable remuneration plan the Company awarded shares to employees 
based on a fixed monetary value of €29.3 million. The number of shares granted 
is estimated based on the monetary value divided by the fair value of the share 
price at grant date. The final number of shares granted are determined based on 
the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the first open period of the 
following year, resulting in an updated calculation of the shares awarded, as is 
shown in the tables below. These awards have a nil exercise price.
Prior year variable remuneration plans have been adjusted as follows:

The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date. The fair value of 
shares granted to employees during 2024 is estimated at grant date at €0.2 
million (2023: €1.1 million), reflecting a weighted average fair value of shares 
granted of €18.50 (2023: €22.9). The exercise price of the share option is equal to 
the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The expense 
recognized during the year was €0.8 million (2023: €1.0 million).

c) Share appreciation rights - cash settled
Certain employees are awarded share appreciation rights (SARs) as part of their 
variable remuneration, settled in cash. The SARs vest in equal installments over a 
period of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The liability for the SARs is measured, initially and 
at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the SARs. The 
carrying amount of the liability relating to the SARs at 31 December 2024 was 
€7.2 million (2023: €8.6 million). The expense recognized during the year was €2 
million (2023: €1.7 million). At year end there are no vested SARs that are unpaid.

In addition to the movement of deferred tax included in the income tax expense 
in the statement of profit or loss,  an amount of €1.3 million is reported through   
other comprehensive income relating to investments at fair value through other 
comprehensive income.
During 2024 we have moved an amount of € 1.1 million between Current tax and 
Deferred tax, partially due to realized gains on investments. The remaining 
movement is explained by exchange rate differences. 
In 2024, it was identified that the offsetting criteria had been met within certain 
tax jurisdictions in both 2024 and 2023. As such, a deferred tax liability of €2.6 
million was offset against deferred tax assets in 2024. The 2023 eligible deferred 
tax liability has not been restated as the Group concluded it was immaterial.

parties to exchange streams of payments over time based on specified notional 
amounts, in relation to movements in a specified underlying index. The Group’s 
derivative assets and financial liabilities are generally not offset in the 
Consolidated statement of financial position unless the IFRS netting criteria are

of receivables for securities that are sold, but not yet settled as at the reporting 
date and amounts due from brokers and exchanges. Trading receivables are 
measured at amortized cost. Given the short-term nature of these assets, their 
carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Additionally, the 
expected credit loss is immaterial.

Due to the short-term nature of these liabilities, their carrying amount is a 
reasonable approximation of fair value. Please also refer to note 17, 18 and 26.
Payables for securities bought
In accordance with the Group’s policy of trade date accounting for regular sale 
and purchase transactions, payables for securities bought represent amounts 
payables for securities that were purchased, but not yet settled as at the 
reporting date. The amount payable is based on the net unsettled amount per 
clearing institution.
Credit Facilities
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to 
facilitate the trading activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of 
financial instruments). The drawn amounts on these facilities continuously 
fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given moment.
The Group has interest-bearing credit facilities with its prime brokers and 
clearing institutions for a total facilities amount of €5,041 million as at 31 
December 2024. The variable interest rate charged on these facilities is based on 
the overnight interest rates per respective currency plus 50 bps. These facilities 
can be modified or terminated at any time and do not have an expiration date 
and is yearly automatically renewed. The facilities are exclusively for the 
financing of positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary course 
of the trading activities using the various prime brokers.
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin 
requirements (representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is 
variable and calculated on a daily basis depending on portfolio size and 
composition) in cash or securities as security for our positions held with the 
relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements. As of 31 December 2024, the amount of financial assets pledged 
as collateral for liabilities was €678 million (2023: €600 million).
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities, the Group is required 
to comply with a net liquidation (or trading capital) balance that exceeds the 
haircut calculated by the prime broker. Both the net liquidation balance and 
haircut are variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio size 
and composition. The main covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to 
loan size (variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio 
composition). In addition, for certain operating subsidiaries of the Group, they 
require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%, calculated by shareholders' 
equity divided by credit limit for the respective subsidiaries.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with 
financial statements and other information, including information on our trading 
activities and trading counterparties. Furthermore, they require us to maintain 
all relevant authorizations and memberships required in order to conduct our 
business, and comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and place 
restrictions on mergers and disposition of our assets outside the ordinary course 
of our business.
Other covenants related to credit facilities provided by prime brokers and 
clearing institutions mainly include ratios in respect of shareholders’ equity for 
the Group and Flow Traders B.V., as well as a minimum regulatory capital ratio 
for Flow Traders B.V.
The Group has not had any defaults and did not breach any covenants with 
respect to any of its liabilities during 2024 and 2023.

several guarantees for the obligations of Flow Traders US Institutional Trading 
LLC, Flow Traders Hong Kong Ltd and Flow Traders US LLC (collectively 
“Beneficiaries”) to external counterparties in relation to trading relationships.
Obligations under the guarantees require Guarantors to fulfil claims of the

one of its prime brokers. If and as long as the solvency ratio of Flow Traders B.V. 
falls below 4% of the maximum credit limit agreed with this prime broker, Flow 
Traders Holding LLC has committed to provide such additional security for Flow 
Traders B.V. in the form of this parental guarantee. The maximum obligation 
under this guarantee for Flow Traders Holding LLC will be 4% of the maximum 
credit limit for Flow Traders B.V. as agreed with the prime broker. The parental 
guarantee shall be in full force and effect until terminated. Flow Traders Holding 
LLC may terminate this guarantee at any time upon 15 days’ prior written notice 
to the prime broker, or at any time upon the written consent of the prime broker.
Flow Traders Holding LLC has provided a guarantee for the obligations of Flow 
Traders B.V. in connection to the EUR 25 million term loan from Barclays Bank 
PLC, which was entered into during the second quarter of 2024. This guarantee 
has the same duration as the loan facility, which is a period of twelve months.
On 30 September 2024, Flow Traders Holdings LLC entered into a deed of 
guarantee and indemnity for the liabilities and obligations of its subsidiary Flow 
Traders Asia Pte. Ltd., in favour of Barclays Bank PLC up to a maximum 
cumulative amount of USD 50 million. This guarantee and indemnity will be in 
effect until the termination of all agreements between Barclays Bank PLC and

and the Americas. In this context, it is possible that tax exposures which have not 
yet materialized may result in different interpretation of local rules. As of 31 
December 2024, management concluded that it is probable that the tax 
authority in the Netherlands will accept our treatment of earnings stripping 
rules. It is possible that different interpretation of local rules may result in tax 
effects from timing differences.
Contingent Assets
Flow Traders Investment Limited (FTIL) held both digital assets and fiat currency 
on FTX Trading Ltd.’s (FTX) digital asset exchange prior to FTX filing bankruptcy 
in November 2022. As a result of that bankruptcy, FTIL derecognised their 
balances held on FTX’s platform during the year ended 31 December 2022. FTIL 
subsequently filed a customer claim with the bankruptcy estate in September 
2023. As a result of the filing, FTIL is an FTX Debtor under the bankruptcy 
proceedings.
During the year ending 31 December 2023, FTX announced a proposed 
settlement plan which included a Preference Settlement Amount. The 
Preference Settlement Amount allowed FTX Debtors the opportunity to resolve 
any liabilities and claims with FTX on a net basis. As of 31 December 2023, the 
Group has concluded that an inflow of economic benefit from the Preference 
Settlement Amount was probable, but not virtually certain (hence, no asset had 
been recognized as of 31 December 2023). On 25 March 2024, the Group sold its 
claim.

others in society who need (financial) help. During 2020 Flow Traders established 
the funding to make sure that a significant financial basis has been laid, so that 
the Foundation has the financial means to make not only an annual but also a 
structural impact and meets its purpose.
In 2024 Flow Traders contributed a total value of €0.6 million (2023: €0.5 million) 
related to support of organizations such as SINA and Project Backboard. The 
Group also reserved an amount from the 2024 variable remuneration pool for 
employees for donation to the Foundation of €0.45 million in 2024 (2023: €0.2

36.  Financial risk management
Overview
The Group is exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
▪
Operational risk;
▪
Credit risk;
▪
Market risk;
▪
Foreign exchange risk;
▪
Interest Rate risk;
▪
Liquidity risk;
▪
Concentration risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing 
risk, and the Group’s management of our liquidity and capital.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Our Group Operational Risk framework contributes to raise awareness of these 
risks to all our employees and promotes a risk mitigation culture in all our 
processes. This includes documenting of procedures and periodically updating of 
this documentation. 
The risk governance and independence of the Risk team ensures that our risk 
appetite is appropriately implemented, monitored and reported to management 
on a regular basis. We maintain an internal operational risk event database that 
captures any incident that may have occurred (irrespective if it led to a financial 
loss/profit or not). We routinely perform an in-depth analysis of these incidents in 
order to avoid a reoccurrence. 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

## Page 126

Every year, we conduct Risk Control Self Assessments (RCSA) across the 
organization to update what our main inherent risks are and which could be the 
most impactful in order to manage them to be within our risk appetite. 
Any breach of risk appetite is escalated to management. A decision is then made 
as to whether we should mitigate, defer or accept the breach. If mitigation is 
considered to be the appropriate action, a taskforce is put in place to bring back 
the residual risk scoring within our risk appetite. This ongoing vigilance ensures, 
that we dedicate the appropriate amount of time and resources to improve our 
control environment in a consistent and risk-based manner.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the 
settlement of off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is 
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the Consolidated 
statement of financial position. These amounts significantly exceed expected 
loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes into account the 
likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of 
counterparty default is deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the 
counterparties and the central counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk at the reporting date was as follows:
Carrying amount
As at 31 December
2024
2023 (restated)
Cash and cash equivalents
8,389
5,708
Trading receivables
5,960,221
5,647,163
Other receivables
35,464
20,675
Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are 
guaranteed by the central counterparty or clearing house related to that 
exchange. Members of these clearing houses are required to deposit substantial 
amounts of cash, bonds or equities as collateral for any failure to settlement of 
trading. There is an inherent risk related to transactions on digital asset 
exchanges and protocols, both centralized and decentralized. Additionally, this 
risk is mitigated by strict onboarding procedures and limiting the assets held for 
trading on each exchange to limit the maximum risk per exchange. 
The Group manages credit risk through its Risk department that provide specific 
guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit 
risk.
Policies include amongst others:
▪
limits for individual product types;
▪
limits per counterparty;
▪
limits on the duration of the exposure;
▪
limits for settlement types;
▪
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements;
▪
limits to exchanges.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty 
exposures are monitored on an intraday basis.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial 
liabilities that:
▪
are offset in the Group’s Consolidated statement of financial position; or
▪
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar 
agreement that covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether 
they are offset in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master 
repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. 
Similar financial instruments include derivatives, sales and repurchase 
agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and 
securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, such as loans and 
deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
Consolidated statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for 
offsetting in the Consolidated statement of financial position. This is because 
they create a right to offset recognized amounts for the parties to the agreement 
that is enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of 
the Group or the counterparties or following other predetermined events.
In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net 
basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can 
receive and grant collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in 
respect of the following transactions:
▪
derivatives;
▪
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
▪
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable 
securities as set out in notes 18 and 27 in respect of derivatives (including swaps). 
Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms including, where 
appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities received/
granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction, 
but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each 
party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure 
to post collateral.
Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to 
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include: 
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and 
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar 
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to offset liabilities against 
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event of 
the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or 
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount 
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit exposure. 
However, the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 are not met in all cases.

Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial 
instrument fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited 
to, interest rates, volatilities, currency exchange rates, future dividend 
expectations and equity prices. The Risk department monitors market risk 
exposure on a continuous intraday basis. Based on the limits set per product or 
the aggregated risk for the Group, limit breaches will trigger action from the Risk 
department in order to reduce the risk back to within our preset limits.
In addition to the Group’s Risk department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily by Operations. The applicable haircut and margins are 
computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The Risk department computes the 
haircut using internal models enabling intraday monitoring. Limits are set on 
both capital and credit usage. Long and short trading positions include securities 
and derivatives such as: shares, American Depository Receipts (ADR’s), options, 
warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRA’s), exchange-traded products 
(ETP) and digital assets. All traded financial instruments are liquid instruments. 
Therefore, our portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame and 
with a limited cost impact.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize its risk for adverse 
price movements and does not engage in long or short only positions. The 
direction of market movements, i.e. what the Group considers directional market 
risk taking, is not relevant for the Group because of our market-making trading 
strategy. Due to the manner in which the Group hedges foreign currency, 
interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency 
risk and settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are 
captured in the risk and margin requirements which the Group is required to 
post at its prime brokers and clearing firms. Although the positions are fully 
hedged, a minimum risk close to zero remains as a result of inefficiencies in the 
models of the prime brokers.
Market risk factors relating to digital assets and liabilities
In a similar matter to traditional assets, the price of a digital asset or liability 
fluctuates according to its supply and demand. We manage this risk by holding 
digital assets in the same proportion as liabilities (long/short delta neutral book).
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions 
denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the 
Group entities, primarily the Euro, as well as United States dollars and Singapore 
dollars.
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well 
as net results of these foreign operations during the year. The Group manages 
foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies 
other than the functional currency. The Group does use financial instruments to 
hedge the translation risk related to net investments in foreign operations or net 
results of foreign operations. Due to the manner in which the Group hedges 
foreign currency risk, the directional foreign currency risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial 
instruments. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches 
of arranged interest rates of assets and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on 
interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These limits ensure that interest rate 
risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies 
are used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. All 
financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair 
value on the Consolidated statement of financial position. Positions carried on 
the Consolidated statement of financial position are short term and listed on 
exchanges and therefore liquid and tradable.
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility 
available to facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the Consolidated 
statement of financial position. In order to match the liquidity and short holding 
period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate payable, which is 
floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact that 
the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short 
positions and in the ETP of the future. Due to the manner in which the Group 
hedges interest rate risk, the directional interest rate risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.

Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as 
the Group’s investments in investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income or through profit or loss. In addition, for its option 
positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk 
factor. Other factors to consider are time and dividend expectations.
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual 
positions per product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the 
size of the exposure, concentrations, pricing and valuation parameters and 
natural hedging between these long and short positions. As the Group is active 
in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in underlying 
values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and 
margins are computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis 
measures all positions, individual and correlated, and reflects the different risk 
components. The third-party haircut calculation confirms the internal 
assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is exposed to 
on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under the earlier "Market risk" section.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the 
obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering 
cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to 
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without 
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The 
Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime 
brokers, is monitored on a daily basis.

Concentration risk
Concentration risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in 
similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have 
similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual 
obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other 
conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s 
performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic 
location. The Group’s policies and procedures and the broad geographic and 
industry spread of its activities limit its exposure to any concentration risk. 
Additionally management has established credit limits for geographic and 
counterparty exposures, which are monitored on a daily basis. We monitor the 
distribution of assets and off-balance sheet items by geographic region and 
industry sector on an ongoing basis.

Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the 
prime brokers through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well 
as cash generated from our operating activities. As of 31 December 2024, the 
Group held €8.4 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to €5.7 million 
as of 31 December 2023. These balances are maintained primarily to support 
operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient short-term 
access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.
The Group maintains a highly liquid Consolidated statement of financial position, 
with a large portion of its total assets consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable 
securities and short-term trading receivables (arising from securities 
transactions).
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intraday basis and maintains 
significant portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to 
facilitate trading. These facilities are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as 
well as all financial assets in accounts held at the respective prime brokers.
Capital management
Regulatory capital requirements
As a result of the corporate restructuring per 13 January 2023 the Group is not 
subject to consolidated capital requirements under the EU Directive Investment 
Firm Regulation (IFR) and Investment Firm Directive (IFD). Regulated Flow 
Traders subsidiaries do comply with the local capital requirement regulations as 
monitored by their respective National Competency Authority (NCA). 
The Board monitors the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to 
shareholders while complying with prime broker and regulatory capital 
requirements. The available capital in the trading companies is monitored on a 
daily basis to ensure that requirements are met at all times and sufficient capital 
is available to support the Group’s strategy. Trading capital as at 31 December 
2024 was €774.9 million (31 December 2023 €583.6 million).
37.  Non-Financial Risks
The disclosure of non-financial risks, including information requests by the AFM 
and DNB to investigate compliance with Dutch Money Laundering and Terrorist 
Financing (Prevention) Act (“Wwft”), has been including on page 30.
38.  Subsequent events
No material subsequent events have occurred since 31 December 2024 that 
require recognition or disclosure in this year’s financial statements.

Notes to the parent Company financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the 
determination of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and 
liabilities and determination of the result for its parent Company financial 
statements, the Group applies the option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the 
Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the recognition and measurement of 
assets and liabilities and determination of the result (hereinafter referred to as 
principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent Company financial 
statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS Accounting 
Standards financial statements. Participating interests over which the Company 
has significant influence, are measured at equity value. Please see Notes to the 
consolidated financials statements for a description of the Group’s IFRS 
Accounting Standards principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Company’s share in the 
results of these participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the 
transfer of assets and liabilities between (i) the Group and its participating 
interests on (ii) between participating interests themselves, are not recognized.

The effective tax rate differs from the (nominal) statutory tax rate. This difference is 
mainly caused by prior year adjustments, a difference in tax rate and non-
deductible share plan costs.
Profit before tax, presented in the note above, for the year ended 2023 has been 
restated to agree to the profit before tax on the Income statement’s comparative 
figures. The previously disclosed amount was incorrect as a loss of €8.2 million. 
This resulted in a difference in the effective tax rate  from the previously presented 
amount of (14.8%).  
12. Other contingent liabilities
Cash incentive provided to employees
As from 2020 certain employees receive part of their variable compensation in 
share appreciation rights (SARs). The SARs vest in equal installments over a period 
of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains employed 
on the vesting date. The SARS are expenses and recognized in the financial 
statements in line with the IFRS 2 Share based payment - cash settled accounting 
rules (refer also to note 9 - Employee Expenses).

16. Legal Reserve
As per the Dutch Civil Code requirement, the Company has a legal reserve which 
is comprised of foreign currency translation reserve, fair value reserve and our 
minimum regulatory capital requirements across the Company’s subsidiaries 
(Other legal reserve).
The Other legal reserve balance as of 1 January 2023 has been restated for a 
calculation error in the opening balance. The effect of the restatement is a 
decrease to Other legal reserves by €34.1 million and an increase to Retained 
earnings by €34.1 million. The movement for the 2023 year has been restated for a 
calculation error, the effect of which was a decrease of €43.9m.
The Fair value reserve has been restated as of 31 December 2023, to account for 
the transfer of the unrealized profits after taxes of €2.7 million on Investments at 
Fair Value through Profit and Loss from Retained Earnings to the Fair value 
reserve, pursuant to Book 2 Article 390, paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.

About sustainability information
Environment metrics
Remarks on GHG emissions data metrics
For scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, Flow Traders 
applies the operational control approach for the 
consolidation of its CO2e emissions footprint. This 
means that Flow Traders accounts for all emissions 
from the operations over which it has control. The 
operations, i.e. office locations, as presented on the 
right have therefore been included in this CO2e 
emissions footprint calculation.

In addition to the office locations, the use of server 
space from data centers is particularly relevant to 
Flow Traders’ business activities. These have been 
included in the scope 3 CO2e emissions footprint 
calculation. Due to the confidentiality of the 
information, the locations of the data centers will not 
be disclosed. 
Data quality 
The calculated CO2e footprint of GHG emissions 
emitted, through Flow Traders’ own business 
activities and those through its value chain, contains 
several factors of uncertainties, primarily due to 
limitations in the availability of actual emissions data. 
Flow Traders obtains third party data from service 
providers for its scope 1, 2 and 3 results. By default, we 
request actual CO₂e data from our landlords and 
utility providers (for scope 1 and 2) and from our value 
chain (for scope 3). However, at this stage, most are 
unable to provide actual CO₂e data. As a result, we 
rely on primary or secondary estimation methods 
based on factors such as energy consumption (kWh), 
distance traveled (km), and expenditure to calculate 
our footprint. We consider that actual emissions data 
will come over time as our suppliers may be subject 
to CSRD reporting or due the increased request from 
their value chain.
The table on next the page provides an overview of 
the calculation methods, uncertainties and data 
limitations for each emission category included in 
the calculation. 
Miscellaneous 
Facilitated emissions
The Facilitated Emissions Standard aims to increase 
transparency across this category of financial  
transactions. The standard covers the primary 
issuance of capital markets instruments and loan 
syndication. A primary issuance refers to new 
securities to provide debt-based or equity-based 
financing, including new issuance of various types of 
bonds issued for general purposes, common stock, 
equity and debt investments in private companies, 
preferred shares, and syndicated loans.
We have reviewed the Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials (PCAF) framework and 
concluded that facilitated emissions are not 
applicable to Flow Traders, whereas Flow Traders 
operates in the secondary markets and does not 
involve with primary issuance of capital or financial 
instruments. 
Social impact assessment
From review of Reporting Framework methodology 
outlined by the United Nations Guiding Principles 
(UNGP) on Business and Human Rights, Flow Traders 
has identified risks related to social, human rights. 
These is focused exclusively on our own operations. 
While Flow Traders has policies in place to promote 
ethical practices, human rights-related issues may 
still arise. Most risks are considered low, reflecting our 
values and inclusive workplace culture. However, 
some areas, particularly those involving cultural or 
individual differences, such as freedom of expression 
and rest, carry a potential medium to high impact if 
not carefully managed. Flow Traders plans to adopt 
targeted initiatives, like fostering mental health and 
encourage open communication in order to further 
mitigate these risks.

Scope 1: Heating 
(natural gas)
Calculation based on secondary data method, by:
▪
Actual natural gas consumption (in kWh) from meter 
reading
▪
Multiplied by the emission factor of natural gas to 
CO2e
Meter reading data is derived from energy supplier invoices. Since invoicing occurs throughout the 
month rather than on the first day, we use a prorated proxy to calculate emissions for the reporting 
period from 1 January, 2024, to 31 December, 2024. Additionally, due to the absence of invoices for two 
months, we estimate based on 366 days over the year. We use the UK government Department of 
Environment, Fuels and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) conversion factors to convert natural gas usage into CO2.
Worldwide 
Scope 1: Company 
car
Calculation based on primary data method, by:
▪
Distance driven in KM
▪
Multiplied by average emission factor of petrol 
medium size car (unknown)
The distance driven is determined using meter reading data from the fleet manager's application. Since 
readings are taken intermittently throughout the reporting year, we use the most recent readings 
available closest to the reporting period -  early December 2023 and mid-January 2025 - to calculate the 
total distance driven during the period. We estimate the total KM driven based on 366 days over the year. 
We use DEFRA conversion factors to convert the total KM driven in the car into CO2. 
Worldwide 
Scope 2: Electricity 
(location-based)
Calculation based on primary data method, by:
▪
Amsterdam, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong, 
London, Cluj, Shanghai office: actual electricity 
consumption from meter reading (in kWh) as 
provided by the electricity supplier/landlord on the 
invoices, multiplied by country specific emission 
factor of the electricity grid
▪
Paris and Milan offices: estimation based on floor size 
in m2 multiplied by average emissions per m2
Meter reading data is derived from energy supplier invoices. Since invoicing occurs throughout the 
month rather than on the first day, we use a prorated proxy to calculate emissions for the reporting 
period from 1 January, 2024, to 31 December, 2024. Additionally, due to the absence of invoices for Cluj 
five-months, London three months, Chicago one month and New York three to five  months, we 
estimate the annual total based on 366 days over the year. We use DEFRA conversion factors to convert 
natural gas usage into CO2.
Worldwide
Scope 2: Electricity 
(market-based)
Calculation based on primary data method, by:
▪
Total scope 2 Electricity Location-based
▪
The total location-based emissions from all reported 
offices minus the total location based emissions from 
Amsterdam and London as these 2 locations' 
electricity are from renewable energy sources 
▪
Milan, Paris and Shanghai is calculated using average 
square meters for each office 
For the share of renewable electricity, we rely on renewable energy certificates provided by our office 
landlords. As of year end 2024, the electricity consumption for our offices in Amsterdam and London is 
sourced from renewable energy. No actual CO2 data is available for any office location, as such location-
based data is used for the calculation to market based emissions).
Green certificates for buildings that don’t cover the reporting period cannot be relied upon in full for 
2024 from an audit perspective. Due to the timing difference between the issuance of the annual report 
and receipt of the 2024 updated green certificates result in certain buildings having to be considered 
gray as oppose to green.
For offices in Paris, Milan and Shanghai we use the square meter for each office and assume an average 
kWh per square meter. This is then converted into CO2e using DEFRA conversion factors.
Worldwide 
(however only in 
Amsterdam, 
London 
renewable 
electricity is used) 
Scope 3: Cat. 7 – 
Employee 
commuting
Calculation based on primary data method, by:
▪
Commuting by various modes
▪
CO2 emissions per travel as provided by NS Business 
Card railway agent
Our data calculation includes all Amsterdam office employees commuting registered by public transport 
using the NS business card. However, employee commuting outside these channels - car, bike, walk - is 
not included in the calculations. Flow Traders calculates the conversion using a weighted average 
conversion factor from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. 
Amsterdam
Scope 3: Cat. 15 - 
Investments
Relevant. No data available from investee’s. The majority 
of material strategic investments are in the form of 
equity and warrant investments in digital asset 
companies, from whom no data is available on 
environmental footprint.
No data is available from the investee companies, and there is no comparable companies, with similar 
business activities, CO₂ footprint average to support a reasonable estimate of scope 3 emissions. Flow 
Traders will work with relevant investees to obtain this data in the future. However for now, we are 
unable to calculate the emissions.

Scope 3: Cat. 1 – 
Purchased services 
from data center 
server space
Calculation based on secondary data method, by:
▪
Total server space capacity purchased (from contract 
agreement / invoice) in kVa (kilo volt ampere) (APAC 
and US)
▪
Server capacity for actual power draw (EMEA 
only).Note that one EMEA data center relies on 
contracted power usage.

▪
The percentage of electricity consumption from 
renewable and non-renewable sources are as 
provided by the data center supplier
▪
Multiplied by country specific emission factor of the 
electricity grid
We rely on confirmation from our data center service providers to determine the share of renewable 
electricity used. As of year-end 2024, the data center services providers were not able to provide the 
Green energy certificates for the reporting year due to timing, hence we used the most recent available 
certificates (2023) and requested a confirmation for 2024. Due to confidentiality, we do not disclose the 
exact number or locations of these data centers. Currently, no actual CO₂ emissions data is available from 
any data center service provider. Instead, we base our calculation on (1) contracted space capacity (2) For 
EMEA DCs we obtain actual power draw from the DCs into our internal reporting dashboard. There is one 
data center that is not included in the reporting dashboard where contracted power is used. Power 
usage is converted into CO₂ greenhouse gas emissions factors from Carbon Footprint ltd.

▪
Total hardware related spend includes servers, 
storage hardware, networking peripherals, switches, 
laptops, screens, data communication, computers, 
racks and other hardware 
▪
Multiplied by supply chain industry (NAICS) specific 
emission factors
Since we use a spend-based calculation, local pricing differences may lead to variations in the emissions 
calculated for the same product. Additionally, we rely on industry-specific emissions factors for the 
supply chain, which are sourced from public data and based on historical figures from previous years. 
There is data limitations at regional offices for all scope 3 categories. We use NAICS conversion factors to 
convert spend amounts into CO₂.

▪
The parent company balance sheet as at 31 December 2024
▪
The parent company income statement for the year ended 31 December 2024
▪
The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other 
explanatory information
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch 
Standards on Auditing and in accordance with the International Standards on 
Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report.
We are independent of Flow Traders in accordance with the Wet toezicht 
accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening 
inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) 
and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we 
have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants 
(VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics for professional accountants). The ViO and VGBA are 
at least as demanding as the International code of ethics for professional 
accountants (including International independence standards) of the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (the IESBA Code) related to 
audits of public interest entities.
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. 
Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following 
information in support of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this 
context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.
Our understanding of the business
Flow Traders is a global financial technology-enabled multi-asset class liquidity 
provider with its core business in Exchange Traded Products, which includes fixed 
income, currencies, digital assets and commodities. Flow Traders is structured in 
components and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. In our audit, 
we paid specific attention to a number of areas driven by the nature of the group 
and our risk assessment.

## Page 151

We determined materiality and identified and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to 
design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Materiality
Materiality
€9.8 million (2023: €2.2 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of profit before tax (rounded)
Explanation
Based on our professional judgment and our 
perception of the financial information needs of the 
users of the financial statements, a benchmark of 5% of 
profit before tax is an appropriate quantitative indicator 
of materiality as profit before tax best reflects the 
financial performance of Flow Traders. We determined 
materiality consistently with the previous financial year, 
as a result our materiality reflects the increase in profit 
before tax as compared to previous financial year.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements 
that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for 
qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the audit committee of the board (hereinafter: the audit 
committee) that misstatements in excess of €0.5 million, which are identified 
during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this 
group is included in the financial statements.
We are responsible for planning and performing the group audit to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the 
financial statements. We are also responsible for the direction, supervision, review 
and evaluation of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We 
bear the full responsibility for the auditor’s report.
Based on our understanding of the group and its environment, the applicable 
financial framework and the group’s system of internal control, we identified and 
assessed risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and the 
significant accounts and disclosures. Based on this risk assessment, we 
determined the nature, timing and extent of audit work performed, including the 
entities or business units within the group (components) at which to perform 
audit work. For this determination we considered the nature of the relevant 
events and conditions underlying the identified risks of material misstatements 
for the financial statements, the association of these risks to components and the 
materiality or financial size of the components relative to the group. We 
communicated the audit work to be performed and identified risks through 
instructions for component auditors as well as requesting component auditors to 
communicate matters related to the financial information of the component that 
is relevant to identifying and assessing risks.
We have: 
▪
Performed audit work ourselves at group entities (components): Flow Traders 
Ltd., Flow Traders B.V., INIT Capital B.V., Flow Traders Holding LLC, Flow Traders 
US Holding LLC and Flow Traders Investments Limited. 
▪
Performed audit procedures ourselves in respect of areas such as investments, 
fair value adjustments of trading positions, variable personnel expenses, 
impairment of equity-accounted investees, taxes and transfer pricing and net 
trading positions.
▪
Used the work of another (non-EY) auditor working under our supervision for 
auditing the group entities: Flow Traders U.S. LLC and Flow Traders 
Institutional Trading LLC (the Flow Traders US operating entities). Moreover, we 
are also directly involved in parts of the audit work by auditing certain accounts 
centrally for Flow Trader U.S. LLC and communicating regularly with the 
component’s management.
▪
Used the audit work of a component auditor from an EY Global member firm 
working under our supervision for the following entities: Flow Traders Asia Pte. 
Ltd., Flow Traders Hong Kong Services Limited, and Flow Traders Hong Kong 
Limited (the Flow Traders Singapore and Hong Kong entities).
This resulted in a coverage of 92% of profit before tax, 99% of total income and 95% 
of total assets.

For other components, we performed analytical procedures to corroborate that 
our risk assessment and scoping remained appropriate throughout the audit. 
We held meetings with local management and component teams and visited the 
component team for Flow Traders Hong Kong entities, observed the component 
operations, discussed the group risk assessment and the risks of material 
misstatements for the Flow Traders Singapore, Hong Kong and US operating 
entities. We reviewed and evaluated the adequacy of the deliverables from 
component auditors and reviewed key working papers for these components to 
address the risks of material misstatement. We held planning meetings, key 
meetings required based on circumstances and we attended closing meetings 
with component teams for the above-mentioned components. During these 
meetings and calls, amongst others, the planning, procedures performed based 
on risk assessments, findings and observations were discussed and any further 
work deemed necessary by the primary or component team was then performed.
By performing the audit work mentioned above at the entities or business units 
within the group, together with additional work at group level, we have been able 
to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial 
information to provide an opinion on the financial statements.
Teaming and use of specialists
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included 
the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed 
client in the business of providing liquidity to financial markets. We included 
specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, derivatives and investments valuation, 
tax and transfer pricing, and have made use of our own experts in the area of 
auditing digital assets and certain disclosures that include capital requirements.
Our focus on climate-related risks 
Climate change and the energy transition are high on the public agenda and lead 
to significant change for many businesses and society. 
The board summarized Flow Traders’ ESG (environmental, social and governance) 
focus areas and reported in the section Sustainability information of the board 
report how the company is addressing climate-related and environmental risks 
also taking into account related regulatory and supervisory guidance and 
recommendations. 
As part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which 
climate-related risks and Flow Traders’ commitments and (constructive) 
obligations, are taken into account in estimates and significant assumptions as 
well as in the design of relevant internal control measures. Furthermore, we read 
the board report and considered whether there is any material inconsistency 
between the non-financial information in the annual report and the financial 
statements.
Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks 
to have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments, estimates or 
significant assumptions as at 31 December 2024.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we 
cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is 
our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, 
taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial 
statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the 
company and its environment and the components of the system of internal 
control, including the risk assessment process and the board’s process for 
responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and 
how the Risk Committee exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to 
Section Our risk management of the board report for the board’s (fraud) risk 
assessment.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control 
and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, the 
global whistleblower policy and incident registration. We evaluated the design 
and the implementation of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. As 
part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with 
respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and 
corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024   
 
 
 
 
 
151


---

## Page 153

whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is 
present.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the 
outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were 
indicative of fraud or non-compliance.
We addressed the risks related to management override of controls, as this risk is 
present in all organizations. For these risks we have performed procedures among 
other things to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may 
represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to 
important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in 
Note 3 (d) to the consolidated financial statements. We have also used data 
analytics to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the 
business rationale (or the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions. 
We evaluated that there are risks of fraud in the gross trading income recognized 
on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, as management may override 
controls around fair value measurement. We describe the audit procedures 
responsive to this risk in our key audit matter “Fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities held for trading”.
Furthermore, we identified a risk related to the private keys of digital asset wallets 
being misappropriated or compromised. We describe the audit procedures 
responsive to this risk in our key audit matter “Existence, rights and obligations 
and valuation of digital assets”.
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, 
directors, internal audit, legal, compliance, human resources, risk management 
and regional directors and the audit committee. 
The fraud risks we identified, enquiries and other available information did not 
lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially 
impacting the view of the financial statements.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations
Flow Traders is subject to many laws and regulations from market regulators and 
for its trading activities on exchanges worldwide where the consequences of non-
compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial 
statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or instructions. We refer 
to section “Our risk management” section of the annual report for the compliance 
and ethical risk identified by the board and Note 33 “Provisions and contingencies” 
to the financial statements.
We performed appropriate audit procedures regarding compliance with the 
provisions of those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the 
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on 
the financial statements from our general industry experience, through 
discussions with the board and the audit committee, reading minutes, inspection 
of internal audit and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of 
details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.
We inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and 
remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the 
audit. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of 
non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.  
Our audit response related to going concern
As disclosed in Note 3 “Basis of preparation” section b) “Going concern basis of 
accounting” to the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial 
statements, the board made a specific assessment of the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for the foreseeable 
future.
We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with the board, exercising 
professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism. We considered 
whether the board’s going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and 
understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or 
otherwise, contains all relevant events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties 
about going concern. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

## Page 154

up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of 
most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have 
communicated the key audit matters to the audit committee. The key audit 
matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. 
In comparison with previous year, the nature of our key audit matters did not 
change.
Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Risk
At 31 December 2024 the financial assets held for trading (long 
positions in equity, debt securities-trading and mark to market 
derivatives asset) amounted to €6.1 billion (2023: €5.6 billion) and 
the financial liabilities held for trading (short positions in equity, 
debt securities-trading and mark to market derivatives liabilities) 
amounted to €4.2 billion (2023: €3.2 billion), as disclosed in Note 
17 and Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements, 
respectively. Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities held for trading is based on internally 
determined theoretical prices as disclosed in Note 8 to the 
consolidated financial statements. These prices can differ from 
closing prices at various stock exchanges or prices from clearers, 
due to market illiquidity, variety in opening hours of the stock 
exchanges and the prices used for identical or near-identical 
positions.
The fair values recorded require judgment which represents a 
risk of improper adjustments directly impacting the gross 
trading income. Therefore, we considered the valuation of 
financial assets and liabilities held for trading a key audit matter.
Our audit 
approach
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the 
appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies related to 
valuation of financial assets and liabilities according to IFRS 9 
“Financial Instruments”, IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”. In 
addition, we obtained an understanding of the valuation process, 
including verifications done by the company. We evaluated the 
design and implementation of internal controls relevant to fair 
value measurement.
Furthermore, we performed the following procedures:
▪
Risk-based sample testing on the valuation of individual 
positions by evaluating the internally determined theoretical 
prices against market prices from independent sources
▪
Independent verification of year end positions with third 
parties (clearers, banks, exchanges) to verify the positions in 
financial assets/liability held for trading as at 31 December 
2024
▪
Subsequent cash receipt testing in January 2025 for 
transactions recorded directly after 31 December 2024 to 
evaluate the valuation of financial assets and liabilities held 
for trading
▪
Cut-off procedures to ensure that transactions are recorded 
in a correct period 
Furthermore, we evaluated the presentation and disclosure in 
the financial statements for compliance and consistency with 
IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure” and IFRS 13 “Fair Value 
Measurement” on disclosure requirements for financial assets 
and liabilities held for trading, including the fair value hierarchy.
Key 
observations
Based on our procedures performed, we consider the fair value 
of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading to be 
reasonable as at 31 December 2024.

Existence, rights and obligations and valuation of digital assets
Risk
At 31 December 2024, the other assets held for trading including 
digital assets traded on centralized and decentralized exchanges 
amounted to €625.0 million (2023: €213.9 million) as disclosed in 
Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Digital assets are exchangeable directly between two parties 
through decentralized networks that record transaction and 
position data, which is publicly observable on the blockchain. 
These are digital assets kept in private wallets, which are each 
safeguarded by a private key. As these private keys grant access 
to the digital assets, the safeguarding of these keys are of high 
importance and there is a risk related to compromised private 
keys or misappropriation of the digital assets. Contradictory to 
digital assets kept in private wallets, direct trades on centralized 
exchanges and related positions in digital assets cannot be 
observed on the blockchain, as the digital assets on these 
centralized exchanges are stored in commingled wallets. 
Ownership is established based on legal terms. Digital assets 
prices are based on the market data from the various exchanges 
where prices vary per exchange. The exchanges are unregulated 
and due to the lack of transparency of transactions and positions 
there is an increased risk to existence, rights and obligations and 
valuation of indicated positions. Reference is made to the 
information on digital assets in Note 8 and Note 36 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Due to the risks involved for both digital assets kept in private 
wallets and in commingled wallets, judgements required to 
establish prices and verification of the quantity of digital assets 
owned by the company, we considered existence, rights and 
obligations and valuation of digital assets a key audit matter.
Our audit 
approach
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the 
appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies related to 
the classification and measurement of the digital assets under 
IFRS Accounting Standards, including IAS 2 “Inventories” and 
IFRS 13 “Fair value Measurement” and current market practice.
Our audit 
approach
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls related 
to digital assets, including reviews performed by the Risk and 
Operations and the Compliance departments in onboarding 
exchanges as well as trading in certain digital assets, involving 
our own experts in the area of auditing digital assets. 
Furthermore, we evaluated the design and implementation of 
the daily trades reconciliation controls and procedures for 
deposits and withdrawals with cryptocurrency exchanges. We 
also evaluated the design and implementation of controls around 
the safeguarding of the private keys.
For digital assets in private wallets, we tested Flow Traders’ 
reconciliation of digital asset ending balances from its books to 
the blockchain and investigated any unusual and other 
reconciling items as at 31 December 2024. We further verified 
that Flow Traders has access to its wallets, and therefore its digital 
assets, before and after the reporting date. For digital assets held 
on centralized exchanges, we observed the positions at the 
majority of the exchanges at year-end to verify the existence and 
rights and obligation thereof.
We evaluated the valuation methodology and consistency of its 
application by the Company. We further tested the valuation of 
individual positions by comparing the internally determined 
prices to independent sources as at 31 December 2024. 
Key 
observations
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any 
material audit findings in relation to the rights and obligations, 
existence and valuation of digital assets as at 31 December 2024.

Valuation of (long-term) investments accounted for at fair value
Risk
Long-term investments include investments measured at fair 
value through Other Comprehensive Income and through Profit 
or Loss. Flow Traders invests in private companies across all 
geographies, with an emphasis on three key themes: platform, 
data, and connectivity. These investments include warrants, 
tokens and equity stakes in the companies of which most are in 
the start-up and scale-up phase. 
At 31 December 2024, the investments measured at fair value 
through Other Comprehensive Income and Profit or Loss totaled 
to €57.8 million (2023: €26.6 million), as disclosed in Note 21 and 
Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. As 
described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, 
management estimates the fair value of (long-term) investments 
measured at fair value, by applying reference to their quoted 
closing bid price at the reporting date or, if unquoted, determined 
using a valuation technique using market observable and 
unobservable inputs and assumptions. Management judgment is 
required for these assumptions, which includes performance 
adjustments and discounts for liquidity.
Determining the fair value of investments using unobservable 
inputs and assumptions is a complex process and requires 
judgment from the board as these investments exhibit higher 
estimation uncertainty. Due to the matters described, we 
considered the valuation of investments accounted for at fair 
value a key audit matter.
Our audit 
approach
With involvement of our specialists, we obtained an 
understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of 
controls over the estimation of the valuation of the (long-term) 
investments and the appropriateness of the valuation 
methodologies applied, including the review of Flow Traders 
policies in line with The International Private Equity and Venture 
Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines and IFRS 13 “Fair Value 
Measurement”. 
Our audit 
approach
We evaluated the reasonableness of inputs used in the valuation 
models and assumptions made by the board as part of their 
valuation process, by performing validation procedures using 
external data where relevant and underlying source 
documentation. For a sample of investment valuations, we 
obtained the valuation models and compared objective inputs 
used in the models to agreements or underlying source 
documents as provided by the company. Furthermore, we tested 
the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models. In addition, 
we evaluated subsequent events and transactions and considered 
whether they corroborated or contradicted the year-end 
estimates. 
Finally, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the 
disclosures related to the fair value measurement of these 
investments in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards.
Key 
observations
Based on our procedures performed we consider the valuation of 
investments accounted for at fair value as at 31 December 2024 to 
be reasonable.

Reliability and continuity of the IT environment
Risk
Flow Traders’ activities and financial reporting are highly 
dependent on the reliability and continuity of the IT environment. 
Flow Traders has a complex IT landscape, with a part of the IT 
services outsourced to service organisations. Effective general IT 
controls with respect to change management, logical access, 
infrastructure and operations, support the reliability and 
continuity of the IT systems as well as the operating effectiveness 
of the automated business controls. Flow Traders as an 
internationally operating group, is inherently subject to higher 
risks of cybersecurity attacks. We refer to the risk category 
“Technology risk” as discussed in the Our risk management 
section of the annual report.
In our audit of the financial statements, we identified the risk that 
the general IT control measures may not always operate as 
intended. The dependency on the IT environment could lead to 
undetected material misstatements in financial reporting. 
Therefore, we considered the reliability and continuity of the IT 
environment a key audit matter.
Our audit 
approach
With the help of IT audit professionals, who are an integral part of 
the audit team, we assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT 
environment to the trading process and evaluated design and 
existence of general IT controls for the applications in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements. Our audit was not 
designed to express an opinion on the continuity and reliability of 
Flow Traders’ automated data processing (or parts thereof).
As part of our audit of the financial statements, we assessed the 
impact of changes to the IT environment during the year for the IT 
applications in scope of the audit of the financial statements. 
Our audit 
approach
Furthermore, we performed the following procedures:
▪
Evaluating the design of the IT general control processes and 
testing the operating effectiveness of IT general controls for 
the main IT processes being access management and change 
management. This was done for the IT applications in scope of 
our financial statements audit as well as for the underlying 
operating system including database management and 
tooling supporting access management and change 
management IT processes 
▪
Designing and executing IT substantive procedures when IT 
general controls where lacking or not operating effectively. 
▪
Reviewing relevant reports of vendors on the design and the 
operating effectiveness of controls when one or more of the 
main IT processes have been outsourced, including critical 
cloud computing outsourcing 
▪
Testing application controls over the trading process and 
interfaces relevant to this process.
Our audit was not aimed at making a statement about the 
cybersecurity procedures, controls and reporting of Flow Traders. 
However, we did obtain an understanding of the cybersecurity 
procedures, controls and reporting as performed by Flow Traders.
Key 
observations
Based on our IT general controls testing procedures and IT 
substantive procedures performed, we have obtained sufficient 
assurance about the reliability and continuity of the IT 
environment relevant in the context of our financial statements 
audit.

Report on other information included in the Annual Report
The annual report contains other information in addition to the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other 
information:
▪
Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material 
misstatements
▪
Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code 
for the management report (excluding a sustainability statement) and the other 
information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding 
obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have 
considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By 
performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 
of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Standard 720 and ISA 720. The scope of the 
procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our 
audit of the financial statements.
The board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the 
management report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and 
other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V., as 
predecessor of Flow Traders Ltd., on 19 May 2016, as of the audit for the year 2016 and 
have operated as statutory auditor ever since that date.
European Single Electronic Reporting Format (ESEF)

Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements
Responsibilities of the board for the financial statements
The board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and Part 9 of Book 2 of 
the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the board is responsible for such internal control 
as the board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board is responsible for 
assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the 
financial reporting framework mentioned, the board should prepare the financial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board either 
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. The board should disclose events and circumstances that 
may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in the financial statements. 
The audit committee undertakes preparatory work for the board’s decision-making 
regarding the supervision of the integrity and quality of the company’s financial 
reporting. Working within the board, the audit committee is charged in particular 
with the supervision with respect to the provision of financial information by the 
company.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows 
us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, 
which means we may not detect all material misstatements, whether due to fraud 
or error during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The 
materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the 
evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional 
skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing 
and ISAs, ethical requirements and independence requirements. The Information in 
support of our opinion section above includes an informative summary of our 
responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.
Our audit further included among others:
▪
Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
▪
Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control
▪
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the 
board
▪
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial 
statements, including the disclosures
▪
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Communication
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine the key 
audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

Provisions in the Bye-Laws governing 
the appropriation of profit
The provisions in the Bye-Laws governing the 
appropriation of profit read as follows: 
Dividends and other payments 
1.
Dividends and Distributions. Subject to these Bye-
Laws, the Board may from time to time declare 
dividends or distributions out of contributed 
surplus to be paid to the Shareholders according 
to their rights and interests, including such 
interim dividends as appear to the Board to be 
justified by the position of the Company. The 
Board, in its discretion, may determine that any 
dividend shall be paid in cash or shall be satisfied, 
subject to Bye -Laws 5.2, 35.1 and 35.2, in paying 
up in full shares in the Company to be issued to 
the Shareholders credited as fully paid or partly 
paid or partly in one way and partly the other. The 
Board may also pay any fixed cash dividend which 
is payable on any shares of the Company half 
yearly or on such other dates, whenever the 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the 
Board, justifies such payment. In making any 
determination regarding the declaration of a 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, the Board must, in addition to any other 
obligations or duties under the Companies Acts 
or these Bye-Laws, consider the Stakeholder 
Interests. 
2. Implementation. Except insofar as the rights 
attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share 
otherwise provide: (a) all dividends or 
distributions out of contributed surplus may be 
declared and paid according to the amounts paid 
up on the shares in respect of which the dividend 
or distribution is paid, and an amount paid up on 
a share in advance of calls may be treated for the 
purpose of this Bye-Law as paid-up on the share; 
(b) dividends or distributions out of contributed 
surplus may be apportioned and paid pro rata 
according to the amounts paid-up on the shares 
during any portion or portions of the period in 
respect of which the dividend or distribution is 
paid. 
3. Deductions. The Board may deduct from any 
dividend, distribution or other monies payable to 
a Shareholder by the Company on or in respect of 
any shares all sums of money (if any) presently 
payable by him to the Company on account of 
calls or otherwise in respect of shares of the 
Company. 
4. No Interest. No dividend, distribution or other 
monies payable by the Company on or in respect 
of any share shall bear interest against the 
Company. 
5. Method of Payment. (a) Subject to Bye-Law 
33.5(b), any dividend, distribution or interest, or 
part thereof payable in cash, or any other sum 
payable in cash to the holder of shares may be 
paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post 
or by courier addressed to the holder at their 
address in the Register or, in the case of joint 
holders, addressed to the holder whose name 
stands first in the Register in respect of the shares 
at their registered address as appearing in the 
Register or addressed to such person at such 
address as the holder or joint holders may in 
writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall, 
unless the holder or joint holders otherwise direct, 
be made payable to the order of the holder or, in 
the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder 
whose name stands first in the Register in respect 
of such shares, and shall be sent at their or their 
risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the 
bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good 
discharge to the Company. Any one of two (2) or 
more joint holders may give effectual receipts for 
any dividends, distributions or other monies 
payable or property distributable in respect of the 
shares held by such joint holders. (b) All dividends, 
distributions or interests in respect of shares held 
by a securities depository, including Euroclear 
Nederland, shall be paid by placing those 
dividends, distributions or interest at the disposal 
of such securities depository, subject to and in 
compliance with the regulations of such 
securities depository. 
6. Unclaimed Amounts. Any dividend or distribution 
out of contributed surplus unclaimed for a period 
of five (5) years from the date of declaration of 
such dividend or distribution shall be forfeited 
and shall revert to the Company and the payment 
by the Board of any unclaimed dividend, 
distribution, interest or other sum payable on or 
in respect of the share into a separate account 
shall not constitute the Company a trustee in 
respect thereof.

7. In-Kind Satisfaction. The Board may also, in 
addition to its other powers, direct payment or 
satisfaction of any dividend or distribution out of 
contributed surplus wholly or in part by the 
distribution of specific assets, and in particular of 
paid-up shares or debentures of any other 
company, and where any difficulty arises in 
regard to such distribution or dividend, the Board 
may settle it as it thinks expedient, and in 
particular, may authorize any person to sell and 
transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions 
altogether, and may fix the value for distribution 
or dividend purposes of any such specific assets 
and may determine that cash payments shall be 
made to any Shareholders upon the footing of the 
values so fixed in order to secure equality of 
distribution and may vest any such specific assets 
in trustees as may seem expedient to the Board, 
provided that such dividend or distribution may 
not be satisfied by the distribution of any partly 
paid shares or debentures of any company 
without the sanction of a Resolution.
Reserves
8. Reserves. The Board may before declaring any 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, set aside such sums as it thinks proper as 
reserves which shall, at the discretion of the 
Board, be applicable for any purpose of the 
Company and pending such application may, also 
at such discretion, either be employed in the 
business of the Company or be invested in such 
investments as the Board may from time to time 
think fit. The Board may also without placing the 
same to reserve carry forward any sums which it 
may think it prudent not to distribute. 
Capitalization of profits
9. Capitalization. The Board may from time to time 
resolve to capitalize all or any part of any amount 
for the time being standing to the credit of any 
reserve or fund which is available for distribution 
or to the credit of any share premium account 
and accordingly that such amount be set free for 
distribution amongst the shareholders or any 
class of shareholders who would be entitled 
thereto if distributed by way of dividend and in 
the same proportions, on the footing that the 
same be not paid in cash but be applied either in 
or towards paying up amounts for the time being 
unpaid on any shares in the Company held by 
such Shareholders respectively or in payment up 
in full of unissued shares, debentures or other 
obligations of the Company, to be allotted and 
distributed credited as fully paid amongst such 
Shareholders, or partly in one way and partly in 
the other, provided that for the purpose of this 
Bye-Law, a share premium account may be 
applied only in paying up of unissued shares to be 
issued to such Shareholders credited as fully paid.

This document contains "forward-looking statements" that relate to without limitation, our plans, objectives, 
strategies, anticipated developments in the industry in which we operate, and future operational performance. 
These forward-looking statements are often identified by terms such as "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend," 
"plan," "predict," "may," "will," "would," "should," "continue," "expect," and similar expressions, though not exclusively. 
Such forward-looking statements are to involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important 
factors that could cause circumstances or actual outcomes, results, performance, or achievements to differ 
materially from any future circumstances, results, performance or achievements expressed or implied. Key factors 
that may affect these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: reduced levels of overall trading 
volumes and lower margins; dependence on prime brokers, ETP issuers, trading counterparties, central 
counterparties (CCPs), and custodians; potential loss of access to important exchange or other trading venues; 
occurrence of systemic market events; incurrence of trading losses; disruptions or failures of our trading platform or 
third-party technical infrastructure; operational risks and challenges inherent to our business and trading activities; 
ineffective risk management systems processes and strategies; intense industry competition; reliance on 
continuous access to liquidity sources; capacity constraints in computer and communication systems; dependence 
on third-party software, infrastructure, or software availability; damage to our reputation and the reputation of our 
industry; loss of key staff or failure to attract and loss of key personnel or challenges in attracting and retaining 
skilled professionals; changes to applicable regulatory requirements; compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations specific to our industry; and enhanced media and regulatory scrutiny affecting public perception 
among other risks. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions, beliefs, and expectations derived 
from our industry experience, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future 
developments, and other factors we deem appropriate. Furthermore, any sustainability-related statements—
pertaining to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations—are based on the best evidence and 
information available to us at the time of this report. These statements, including those regarding future 
opportunities or risks, are inherently uncertain and subject to change as our understanding of ESG factors evolves. 
From a quantitative perspective, some of our sustainability metrics, such as emissions calculations, rely on estimates 
and external sources, including conversion factors. These estimates are based on current methodologies and 
sources, which may vary, leading to potential adjustments in reported figures over time. As such, the figures 
presented in this report should be understood as estimates that could change depending on the data sources or 
methods employed. While we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking and sustainability 
statements are reasonable as of the date they are made, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Therefore, you are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange 
regulations, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or 
sustainability metrics, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Any forward-looking 
statements should not be interpreted as guarantees of future performance or outcomes. If the risks or uncertainties 
materialize, or if the assumptions underlying our forward -looking statements prove inaccurate, our actual 
operational results, financial condition or sustainability outcomes could differ significantly from those anticipated, 
believed, estimated or expected. Statements regarding the market, industry trends, including the FX market, 
developments in ETP Assets under Management in specific markets, ETP value traded in certain markets and Flow 
Traders’ competitive position, are based on external data and sources. As these sources and methodologies evolve, 
so too may the information we present.
