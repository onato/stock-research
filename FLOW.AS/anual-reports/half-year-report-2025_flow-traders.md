Leadership update 
Building on our growth agenda
In the first half of 2025, we remained focused on the execution of our strategic 
growth agenda, including optimizing our core operations, enhancing our 
quantitative capabilities, and improving our technology infrastructure. Our 
strategy aims to both strengthen our existing foundation as well as embrace the 
future of financial markets with agility and innovation.
Leadership updates during the first half of 2025
In April 2025, Mike Kuehnel informed the Board of his decision not to seek re-
election for another term as Chief Executive Officer. Mike will officially step down 
from his role as CEO and Executive Director of the Board at the end of August 
2025. During Mike’s time with Flow Traders, he demonstrated unwavering 
commitment, a strategic and innovative approach, and an inspiring vision for the 
Company’s future. Under Mike’s guidance and support, Flow Traders expanded its 
global presence, strengthened its technological infrastructure and enhanced its 
capabilities. His dedication to fostering a culture of excellence and collaboration 
within the organization has been instrumental in achieving our strategic goals. 
On behalf of the Board and the entire Flow Traders team, we extend our heartfelt 
gratitude to Mike for his remarkable efforts and dedication. Mike’s support and 
assistance throughout the transition period has been extremely valuable, and we 
wish Mike the very best in his future endeavors.
As part of the leadership change, we are pleased to announce that Marc Jansen 
has been appointed Co-Chief Trading Officer and has received shareholder 
approval for his appointment as Executive Director of the Flow Traders Ltd. Board, 
officially assuming his role on 1 September 2025, subject to regulatory vetting. 
Looking ahead to the second half of 2025
The Board has actively been engaged in identifying a successor for Mike, 
evaluating a pipeline of promising candidates. After a comprehensive search 
process and extensive discussions, the Board is pleased to announce the 
appointment of Thomas Spitz as new CEO and Executive Director of the Flow 
Traders Ltd. Board, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, the latter 
expected to come at an upcoming Special General Meeting of shareholders. 
Thomas will join Flow Traders on 1 September 2025. The Board is committed to 
driving the company forward and is confident that Thomas possesses the vision, 
expertise, and leadership skills necessary to lead Flow Traders into the next phase 
of its growth.

Markets and trends 
ETP investing
The ETP ecosystem continues to mature and 
experience significant growth in both AuM and 
number of products in the first half of 2025. 
According to ETFGI, global ETP AuM increased from 
$14,846 billion at the end of 2024 to $16,874 billion at 
the end of June 2025. This is a reflection of the 
underlying market performance during the first half 
of 2025 coupled with record inflows into ETPs. The 
market expectation is that AuM will continue to grow 
going forward and we believe there are several 
reasons for this. One is that investors are attracted to 
the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables them 
to clearly follow how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid 
products which offer low transaction costs. A third 
reason is that ETPs can be composed of financial 
instruments from almost any asset class, sector or 
location, providing investors with access to markets 
that would normally be difficult to reach.  
Global ETP markets grew by 14% in the first half of 
2025, as measured by AuM, driven by the 
outperformance of the underlying markets as well as 
record inflows. Global inflows into ETP funds were 
$898 billion in the first half of 2025 ($686 billion in 
first half of 2024, as per ETFGI). Overall trading 
activity in the first half of 2025 increased significantly 
compared to the same period in the prior year given 
broad-based tariff announcements from the U.S. 
administration. 
Global coverage 
In the first half of 2025, Flow Traders’ ETP value 
traded was just short of the €1 trillion mark, coming 
in at €999 billion, an all-time high for a six-month 
period, compared to €755 billion in the first half of 
2024. The European ETP market recorded total ETP 
value traded of €1,717 billion in the first half of 2025, 
compared to €1,178 billion in the first half of 2024. 
Flow Traders' total ETP value traded in Europe was 
€465 billion in the first half of 2025, compared to 
€300 billion in the first half of 2024. We remain a 
leading liquidity provider in European ETPs and 
managed to grow our on- and off-exchange trading 
capabilities further. 
The largest ETP market globally remains the 
Americas, where total ETP value traded (on- and off-
exchange) was €24,278 billion in the first half of 2025, 
compared to €19,054 billion in the first half of 2024. 
Flow Traders' ETP value traded in the Americas was 
€446 billion in the first half of 2025, compared to 
€406 billion in the first half of 2024. Institutional 
trading continued to expand and Flow Traders 
continued to grow and deepen its overall presence in 
this important market.  
In APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with 
large differences in trading volumes, trading costs, 
regulation and maturity across the financial markets. 
The Asian ETP market recorded total ETP value 
traded of €4,938 billion in the first half of 2025, 
including China, compared to €2,761 in the first half 
of 2024. Flow Traders' total ETP value traded in Asia 
was €88 billion in the first half of 2025, compared to 
€50 billion in the first half of 2024. The record ETP 
valued traded for Flow Traders in the first half of the 
year reflects the importance of APAC as a growth 
driver for the Company in the near future.
Our business - operations
We operate three main trading hubs in Amsterdam, 
Hong Kong, and New York, which are supported by 
branch offices. We have ongoing access to 180+ 
exchanges and trading venues, globally. We provided 
liquidity in over 6,500 unique ETP ISINs on- and off-
exchange, which is more than 40% of all ETPs 
globally. Off-exchange, we provided liquidity in ETPs 
on a RFQ basis to more than 2,000 institutional 
counterparties across the globe, including banks, 
asset managers, pension funds, insurance 
companies, family offices, hedge funds, and others, 
and this number is increasing on an almost daily 
basis. In addition to ETPs we provide liquidity in 
similar instruments whose value is correspondingly 
affected by a change in the value of underlying or 
related assets, such as futures or bonds. 
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider 
we generally do not have a directional opinion on the 
market. In other words, our results do not depend on 
the direction of market prices. Our net trading 
income is derived from the small price differences 
that are realized between buying and selling related 
or correlated assets. Whether that is between the 
ETPs we buy or sell, the prices we pay or receive for 
the underlying related financial instruments to 
mitigate our risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager 
and do not have client AuM as we trade from our 
own capital. We also do not develop or make 
products, do not provide any services and do not 
have (consumer) clients. Our value chain comprises, 
among others, of our institutional counterparties, 
prime brokers and regulators.

Financial performance 
Financial overview
Flow Traders recorded a Net trading income (NTI) of 
€283.6 million in 2025 (vs. €206.6 million in HY2024) 
reflecting the overall market and trading 
environment. Losses from the investment portfolio, 
which includes digital asset holdings, were  
€4.6 million (first six months of 2024 a loss of 
€0.8 million). These losses are presented within 
Other income or (expense).
On the cost side, adjusted operating expenses 
increased to €100.5 million for the first six months of 
2025 (€87.2 million in the first six months of 2024). 
The increase is mainly attributed to the annual 
wages recalibration and increased technology costs 
in support of our trading activities and further due to 
general price inflation. FTEs were slightly higher this 
period at 607 (30 June 2024: 594). Variable employee 
expenses increased to €48.2 million (€35.0 million in 
the first six months of 2024) which is in line with the 
improved financial performance of the business 
during the period.
Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
continued to demonstrate solid operational leverage 
with an EBITDA margin of 46.7% in 2025 (restated 30 
June 2024: 40.6%) with EBITDA of €130.3 million 
(restated first six months of 2024: €83.6 million), due 
to the improved performance of the business.  
EBITDA for the first six months of 2024 has been 
adjusted as a result of the restatement of Other 
expenses (note 10). Additionally, EBITDA margin for 
the first six months of 2024 has been adjusted as a 
result of the above and calculating EBITDA as a 
percentage of Total income and not NTI. Total 
income consists of NTI and Other income or 
(expense). Profit for the first six months of 2025 was 
€87.5 million (first six months of 2024: €59.0 million), 
with basic EPS of €2.01 (first six months of 2024: 
€1.36).
Non-IFRS performance
Non-IFRS financial measures are disclosed in 
addition to the statement of comprehensive income, 
in order to provide relevant information to better 
understand the underlying business performance of 
our Company. 
In 2024, we decided to simplify our use of non-IFRS 
measures and discontinued the use of normalized 
alternative performance measures to reduce 
complexity in financial reporting and to adhere to 
accounting best practices. 
Flow Traders has the following non-IFRS financial 
measures:
▪
Adjusted operating expenses: Calculated as 
fixed employee expenses, technology expenses 
and other expenses. The measure provides a 
focused metric of the core operating expenses of 
the Company while removing the variable 
employee expenses which are dependent on 
current-year results
▪
EBITDA: Calculated as the operating result, before 
depreciation, amortization on intangible assets 
and (Reversal of) Impairment of intangible assets. 
EBITDA is used as it focuses on core trading and 
operational activities
▪
EBITDA margin: EBITDA as a percentage of the 
total income. The margin is used as a measure of 
profitability. The Company has changed its 
alternative performance measures (APM) from 
the prior year, where the percentage was based 
on net trading income, to ensure the APM reflects 
the financial performance presented within Other 
income or (expense)
▪
Revenue by region: Consists of net trading 
income, other income or (expense), inter-segment 
revenue related to trading activities less inter-
segment expense related to trading activities
Dividend Policy 
Flow Traders may or may not distribute out of the 
Company's net profits realized during the financial 
year to shareholders. The Company's Board may 
decide, in accordance with the Company's Bye-Laws 
and Board Rules, that the profits realized during a 
financial year will fully or partially be appropriated to 
increase and/or form reserves. A distribution of 
dividends is subject to applicable rules and

## Page 9

regulations, the Company's Bye-Laws and the Board 
Rules. 
If applicable, dividends will be declared and paid 
following the publication of our results. There can be 
no assurance that in any given year a dividend will be 
proposed or declared. 
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts 
and timing thereof, will depend on a number of 
factors, including future profits, financial conditions, 
general economic and business conditions, and 
future prospects and other factors the Board may 
deem relevant, as well as other legal and regulatory 
requirements. Our intentions in relation to dividends 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our 
control.

Risk management
Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF) forms the foundation 
of our approach to managing risks. The 
ERMF is documented in Flow Traders’ 
Enterprise Risk Management Policy and is 
reviewed on an annual basis.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify 
and document potential risks which are inherent to 
trading in an automated market-making firm. In the 
fast and dynamic environment of automated trading, 
we designed our ERMF in such a way that it is robust, 
efficient and transparent. In the figure below, we 
present the stakeholders that have an interest and 
place value in how our framework operates. 
Our ERMF helps us to ensure that we have adequate 
systems and controls including the management of 
our liquidity and capital. This is delivered through a 
consistent, continuous and careful method for 
addressing, managing and prioritizing our key risks 
in the context of our strategic goals.

Enterprise risk management (ERM)
We aim for a good balance between our business 
activities, return on capital and related risks taken. 
Flow Traders’ ERM approach ensures that our risk 
appetite and profile are integrated into our day-to-
day operations and strategic decision-making. 
Annually, the Board determines the strategic goals 
and subsequent business targets. Based on these 
targets, the Company formulates its risk appetite. 
These targets and risk appetite parameters provide 
direction to our various departments and are used to 
determine our strategic risks. 
Policies and control standards are maintained, 
developed and updated within the ERMF. The 
policies are based on our risk taxonomy and aligned 
with our control setting. To ensure that our daily 
activities remain in line with our risk appetite and 
residual risk we perform yearly Risk Control Self-
Assessments (RCSA) to evaluate current risks and 
identify new risks. We also conduct an annual Risk 
Management Control Cycle to define and test our 
key controls that mitigate our critical, high and 
medium inherent risks in all of our business 
processes to accepted residual risk levels.
Risk categories
Our risk taxonomy is split into five broad risk 
categories - Financial, Business and strategic, 
Compliance and ethical, Operational, and 
Technology - each with their own specific sub-risks:

Risk taxonomy 
domain
Level 1 risk 
category
Description of the risk
Financial risk
Capital risk
Capital risk (cost of doing business) refers to the situation where potential 
loss of investment value happens due to factors such as market volatility, 
regulatory and prime broker requirements, economic downturns, or poor 
financial performance of a company. It is the risk of failing to meet 
compulsory capital requirements invested in an asset or investment which 
are needed to maintain a firm’s trading licenses and normal business 
activities and relationships with prime brokers.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refers to the inability to replenish capital to the required level. 
This can happen when: 1) not being able to obtain additional funding in a 
timely manner at a reasonable cost and 2) an inefficient internal 
management on liquidity. This is the risk of not being able to quickly 
convert an investment into cash without experiencing a significant loss in 
value, due to a lack of buyers or sellers in the market, restrictions on 
trading, or the illiquid nature of the asset itself that leads to an inability to 
easily buy or sell an asset without incurring significant costs. It can also 
happen because of a lack of access to alternative sources of funding such 
as short-term loans, trading credit from certain platforms, etc. in a timely 
manner. This is the risk of internal management deficiency which can lead 
to liquidity constraints.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in 
market prices; in particular, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, and equity, cryptocurrency and commodity prices.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in 
trading in or issuing a financial instrument defaulting on an obligation.

Level 1 risk category
Description of the risk
Business and  
strategic risk
Strategy risk
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of a company’s business plan, from strategic changes in the business environment, and/or 
from adverse strategic business decisions. Market activity risk is part of this risk as trading income and profitability are primarily a 
function of the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial instruments traded. 
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or products. Concentration risk also 
includes supplier dependency risks.
Project delivery & 
management risk
The risk of inaccurate project management leading to inadequate realization of strategic project objectives.
Sustainability & 
environment risk
The risk that an environment, social or governance (related) issue or event will impact the entity financially, non-financially and/or 
in the realization of strategic objectives of the entity.
Compliance and 
ethical risk
Fraud risk 
Acts intended to defraud, misappropriate assets, deceive or circumvent regulations or the law, attempted or perpetrated against 
the entity.
Reputation risk
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders.
Financial crime risk
The risk of money laundering, sanctions violations, bribery and corruption, and Know Your Customer (KYC) failure.
Regulatory compliance 
risk
Failure to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations that are not captured through other risks.  
Conduct risk
Failure to act in accordance with internal and external stakeholders and society's best interests, fair market practices, and codes of 
conduct.
Operational risk
Business continuity risk
The risk of failure to provide and maintain appropriate Business Continuity Management (BCM), including inadequate business 
continuity plans.
Trading execution risk
The risk of losses due to errors in the execution.
Legal risk
Legal risk refers to the potential exposure and negative consequences that an individual or organization may face as a result of 
non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and legal obligations.
People risk
The risk that the entity is not able to develop, retain and attract the necessary skills and diverse capabilities in its workforce to 
realize strategic objectives.
Model risk
Model risk for a trading firm refers to the potential for adverse consequences resulting from errors or limitations in the financial 
models and algorithms used for trading and risk management. This risk arises from the reliance on mathematical models and 
computer algorithms to make trading decisions, value financial instruments, and manage risk. Model risk can stem from 
inaccuracies in the models, inappropriate assumptions, data errors, or the failure to account for all relevant market factors.
Reporting risk
The risk of not being able to report adequately to stakeholders (e.g., regulatory reporting).
Taxation risk
The risk of unexpected tax charges, including interest and penalties including tax related events resulting in for example a 
damaged reputation with the tax authorities, investors, employees and the public at large.

The effectiveness of risk management is linked to 
commitment and integrity. It is crucial that the 
Board, the global and local department heads, as 
well as all employees are aware of the risks that our 
Company faces and their responsibilities in 
managing these effectively.
Our risk management is organized along three 
lines of defense. The first line of defense is 
comprised of Trading, Technology and Operations. 
These departments are critical for managing the 
core processes within Flow Traders and are 
responsible for incorporating preventive and 
detective controls into the day-to-day trading and 
IT processes as well as for the continuous 
monitoring of our systems and trading controls.
The second line of defense is responsible for  
oversight and monitoring of risks, rules and 
requirements. Risk, Compliance, Legal and Finance 
manage risks through a combination of preventive 
and detective controls. Together they are 
responsible for the continuous risk management 
of the Company. 
On the second line we have the Financial & Capital 
Risk Committee and the Non-Financial Risk & 
Compliance Committee. The Financial & Capital 
Risk Committee includes oversight reporting and 
planning in relation to market, credit and treasury 
risk within the Company. Whereas the Non-
Financial Risk & Compliance Committee reviews a 
wide range of risks that are not directly related to 
financial matters, such as business and strategic 
risk, compliance and ethical risk, operational risk 
and technology risk. 
The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’ Internal Audit function (IA). They provide independent and 
objective assurance and advice on the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control 
systems. This helps to achieve the competent application of systematic and disciplined processes, expertise, and 
insight. They report their findings to management and the governing body to promote and facilitate continuous 
improvement. The IA carries out its audit work in accordance with the approved and implemented Group 
Internal Audit Charter.

The annual Risk Management Cycle follows 
the ERMF
Every year the Executive Directors and senior 
leadership establish strategic goals, generally in 
November/December, subsequently the business 
targets are set. Then, the Board approves both the 
strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Board is involved in the strategy 
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are 
then translated into annual Company-wide, 
departmental and individual goals and discussed in 
an annual meeting with senior leadership. 
Based on the targets and objectives, the Executive 
Directors and senior leadership formulate the risk 
appetite of the Company. The targets, objectives and 
risk appetite give direction to the various 
departments within Flow Traders and are used to 
derive the Company’s strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management Cycle is used to 
identify, manage and mitigate our financial, non-
financial and compliance risks. 
The Risk Management Cycle consists of four 
recurring activities: risk identification & assessment, 
risk control, risk monitoring and risk reporting. The 
cycle is designed and implemented to determine 
and assess our risk, take mitigating actions to control 
our risk, monitor the effectiveness and developments 
of the taken measures and report findings and 
effectiveness of all measurements and actions taken. 
The Risk Management Cycle ensures that our 
residual risk profile remains in line with our annual 
set risk appetite and that emerging risks, changed 
risk levels or non-effective controls are identified, 
assessed and analyzed in a timely manner.

Risk reporting
Flow Traders has a Financial & Capital Risk  
Committee and a Non-Financial Risk & Compliance 
Committee that continuously assess the risks we face 
in our business, and are comprised of our Global 
Head of Risk and Compliance, the Executive 
Directors and certain members of our senior 
leadership. 
Aside from regular communication, there are  
quarterly Financial & Capital Risk and Non-Financial 
Risk & Compliance Committee meetings. During 
these meetings they discuss all risk assessments and 
risk proposals related to position limits, strategies, 
procedures, liquidity and capital requirements, 
regulatory compliance, AML, incidents and market 
developments. Any material change to our risk 
profile, systems, strategies and limits must 
subsequently be approved by the Financial & Capital 
Risk and Non-Financial Risk & Compliance 
Committees. 
In addition to these standing Committees, we have a 
Risk & Sustainability Committee, all members of the 
Board are part of the Committee. The Global Head of 
Risk and Compliance informs the Risk & 
Sustainability Committee about the effectiveness of 
the internal risk management and control systems. 
This includes the reasonable assurance that the 
aforementioned systems do not contain any material 
inaccuracies. 
The tasks of the Risk & Sustainability Committee 
include supervision and monitoring, and advising the 
Executive Directors, and Co-Chief Trading Officers on 
the operation of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems. As well as 
providing advice on the Company’s development, 
performance, sustainability of its trading strategies 
and reviewing the risk of the Company.

Key risks detailed 
Key financial risk 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk management is vital to maintain a 
robust financial institution. Liquidity risk is defined as 
the risk that Flow Traders Ltd. cannot meet its 
financial liabilities when they become due, at a 
reasonable cost and in a timely manner. We have a 
robust framework in place to manage liquidity risks, 
as insufficient liquidity can pose an immediate threat 
to the continuity of trading activities.
The liquidity risk framework includes, among others, 
requirements and processes related to the 
maintenance of the liquidity buffer, both in a 
‘business-as-usual’ and under potential stress 
situations. Furthermore, the framework contains 
procedures to actively manage liquidity risk across 
asset classes, countries, legal entities and in multiple 
currencies. This includes taking into account 
regulatory- and operational requirements for the 
maintenance of adequate liquidity.
Furthermore, we define liquidity as the sum of excess 
liquidity over the requirement (haircut) at our prime 
brokers, as that is the basis for being able to facilitate 
all funding and liquidity needs. Given our business 
model as a market maker where we generally hedge 
any position taken instantly, our key liquidity risk is 
not so much in risking a significant loss, but rather in 
not being able to cover the requirements our prime 
brokers charge us. Therefore, our key liquidity risks 
are those that affect either the total pool of liquid 
assets we hold at our prime brokers and crypto 
exchanges or the total requirement that our prime 
brokers necessitate us to hold with them (haircut).
Market risk
Flow Traders is exposed to market risk arising from 
trading positions in instruments that are price-
sensitive to various factors such as company 
valuations, interest rates, FX rates, commodities and 
digital asset prices. As a liquidity provider we 
continuously provide bid and offer prices in multiple 
product groups across multiple financial markets. 
The bid and offer prices are calibrated such that the 
expected value of the trades and the hedges are 
positive while the resulting market risk is immaterial.
We have a multitude of trading desks which are 
providing liquidity in various products and various 
markets. The core business being equity and fixed 
income products and the Company also trades FX, 
commodities and digital assets. Each individual desk 
trades (close to) delta neutral hereby ensuring total 
market risk is therefore close to delta neutral. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing 
institution involved in trading in or issuing a financial 
instrument defaulting on its obligation. As part of our 
credit risk framework, Flow Traders monitors 
platform credit risk on a real-time basis against an 
established credit risk limit. In addition, Flow Traders 
has real-time monitoring on platform assets in- and 
out-flows to be able to anticipate on a platform 
insolvency event. Furthermore, funding is spread 
across multiple platforms and counterparties 
ensuring a diversified allocation that greatly limits 
the impact of a possible credit risk or liquidation 
event. The Company manages credit risk through its 
Risk and Mid-Office departments that provide 
specific guidelines, rules and procedures for 
identifying, measuring and reporting credit risk. 
Policies include amongst others: 
▪
limits for individual product types;
▪
limits per counterparty;
▪
limits on the duration of the exposure; 
▪
limits for settlement types; 
▪
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Business and strategic risk
Concentration risk (Market business risk)  
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of 
the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the 
financial instruments in which we trade, and the bid-
ask spreads (which largely determine the profit on 
the trade, or margins, we capture). 
Trading volumes in securities, derivatives, currencies, 
commodities, cryptocurrencies and other financial 
instruments on exchange and on other trading 
venues are directly affected by factors beyond our 
control, including economic and political conditions, 
broad trends in business and finance, regulatory 
requirements, actions by central banks, and changes 
in the markets in which such transactions occur.
To cope with periods of low market activity, we have 
diversified our trading into different products and 
markets. This is to safeguard that we are not overly 
dependent on market activity in one particular asset 
class or product type. 
Compliance and ethical risk 
Flow Traders continues to be a strong driver of 
effective, efficient and equal regulation and we 
contribute to the regulatory dialogue in our key 
jurisdictions to campaign for markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly manner.
Financial crime risk 
We are committed to complying with all relevant 
laws and regulations that apply to us, wherever we 
FLOW TRADERS | HALF YEAR REPORT 2025

## Page 18

operate. Especially important are the rules around 
anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering.
We also have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-
money laundering policies in place that apply to all 
our employees. We expect our counterparties, 
business partners, intermediaries, contractors and 
subcontractors to adhere to the same standards. We 
believe that the risk of bribery or corruption is very 
limited as we do not hold or manage client money or 
assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain 
production facilities or source raw materials. 
Nevertheless, our employees receive regular training 
in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering practices, as the Board would like to 
reinforce the importance of these policies. 
As part of our compliance framework, we also follow  
stringent KYC processes as part of our onboarding of 
new counterparties and projects.    
Regulatory compliance risk
We trade with institutional counterparties and do 
not provide investment services or ancillary services 
to third parties; our markets and nearly all aspects of 
our business are highly regulated. Where applicable, 
entities forming part of our Company have obtained 
the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses.
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in 
three international jurisdictions, Amsterdam, New 
York and Hong Kong/Singapore and supported by  
branch offices. As a Company, we currently trade on 
180+ exchanges and trading venues worldwide as 
well as operating on numerous other venues 
through our brokers. Our regulatory landscape is 
broad as we have to comply not only with our local 
regulations, but also the trading rules of all venues on 
which we trade. 
Legislators and regulators globally continue to 
closely supervise the financial markets in which we 
operate. This places significant demand on Flow 
Traders to maintain a professional, well-structured 
and compliant organization. 
The Compliance, Risk and Operations departments 
have implemented controls, internal rules and 
processes that have been systematically developed 
following applicable regulatory requirements, 
guidelines from market authorities, and industry best 
practices. 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable 
laws or regulatory requirements could adversely 
affect our reputation and in turn our long-term 
profitability and future business prospects. This may 
also be the case to a lesser degree for differences in 
interpretation or lack of timely or complete 
implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, 
disgorgement and censures, suspension or expulsion 
from trading venues or the revocation or limitation of 
licenses. 
We aim to minimize such risks by focusing 
considerable management attention to choose the 
most appropriate strategic approach. We employ 
highly-qualified compliance and risk professionals to 
allow the deployment of staff training; to efficiently 
update our monitoring and reporting systems; and 
to be able to continuously evaluate the impact of 
current and upcoming regulations on our operations 
to find the optimal path to evolve our processes. 
Notwithstanding such efforts and given the highly 
regulated nature of our business, we remain subject 
to routine (and more targeted) inquiries and audits 
from our global regulators and our trading venues. 
Conduct risk
Given the highly interconnected nature of the 
financial markets ecosystem we are a part of, we 
recognize that should any of the risks referenced 
within this section materialize, there could be a 
negative impact on various external third parties.
Specifically, market and operational risk events could 
negatively impact key parties within our value chain, 
namely our counterparties and our prime brokers. 
This could limit our counterparties’ ability to trade 
with us or to do settlement trades effectively on a 
timely basis. Moreover, the various prime brokers we 
work closely with could also be exposed to similar 
risks.
We believe that each employee has an individual and 
collective responsibility for ensuring an honest and 
ethical business conduct within our Company. 
Therefore, our Code of Conduct, forms part of our 
employment documentation.
Ensuring adherence with our Code of Conduct is the 
responsibility of the Executive Directors and the  
senior leadership. Any reported potential breaches 
are investigated fully by members of our senior 
leadership team in accordance with existing clearly 
laid out procedures and policies. Our Code of 
Conduct can be found on our website. 
In addition to our culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have a detailed 
Whistleblower Policy in place for all employees and 
relevant contractors, approved by our Executive  
Directors. 
FLOW TRADERS | HALF YEAR REPORT 2025

The Whistleblower Policy also provides any 
whistleblower with anonymity, confidentiality, and 
the Company will not impose sanctions on disclosure 
(or affect an employee’s legal position) when the 
employee reports a suspected misconduct in good 
faith, unless the employee is involved in the issue 
that is being reported. We respect a non-retaliation 
approach when a suspected misconduct is reported. 
Our Whistleblower Policy can be found on our 
website. 
Operational risk 
Business continuity risk 
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, 
systems or external events. Operational risk 
management is an integral part of our risk and 
control systems. Our operational risk is dominated by 
technology-related events at our exchanges and 
clearing members. Therefore, the level of our 
investment in technology is important to mitigate 
those associated risks as well as having resilient and 
robust internal systems and controls. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, high-
performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new 
hardware and software. 
Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement 
improvements in both hardware and software on an 
ongoing basis. Controlled releases of hardware and 
software enhancements provide for minimal 
disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or 
updates of our trading software) is being developed 
is strictly separated from the environment in which 
such trading software operates in production. Access 
to the source code is strictly controlled and limited. 
Prior to any releases relating to our trading software, 
or an update into our production environment, any 
element of our trading software is subjected to a 
review of its code, testing in a development 
environment that is separate from our production 
environment. Furthermore, validation occurs on  
limited production (processing a strictly limited 
number of trades) and on one trading desk in 
respect of trading a single financial instrument, 
followed by more extensive testing across multiple 
desks and/or trading multiple financial instruments. 
Each step must be completed before the next and 
also appropriately documented. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control 
undisrupted trading activities in real time. Multi-layer 
monitoring is employed to avoid errors. When an 
error does occur, the relevant teams are immediately 
notified via multiple different channels. We rely on 
multiple third-party service providers for business 
and market data, which is a key part of what is 
monitored. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with 
our proprietary technology platform, analyzing real-
time pricing data, and is designed to ensure that our 
order activity is conducted within strict 
predetermined trading and position limits. For 
example, our pre-trade [risk] controls are designed to 
prevent the trading engines from sending quotes 
that deviate from our predefined risk parameters. 
These include price and volume limits, which are 
independently set and monitored by our Risk 
function. This keeps our ordering, trading and 
positions well within our preset tolerance levels. Our 
post-trade monitoring tools include trade-level 
reconciliation of prices and positions against those of 
our exchanges and prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration 
tests by external experts. We have a comprehensive 
IT security system that is designed to protect us from 
attacks both from internally and externally. 
Where we have a technical interface with institutions 
such as our prime brokers and exchanges, the 
integrity of the connection between the systems and 
the data that is being exchanged is subject to prior 
conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, 
we continuously review to ensure it adequately 
captures relevant scenarios. 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we 
start trading on any new platforms, including 
platforms designated for trading digital assets. While 
many of these platforms remain unregulated, many 
have strongly improved their own onboarding 
procedures and counterparty identification 
procedures. While we believe our own procedures 
are strong, the unregulated status of these platforms 
and their location in emerging economies makes 
them inherently less institutionalized and supervised 
than regulated platforms in developed economies. 
We therefore subject these platforms to increased 
monitoring and due diligence.
Technology risk 
While the Company’ foundation is technology-driven, 
these risks and impacts are reflected and linked with 
the above categories. Specifically, under technology 
risks, we have carved out cyber risks to highlight a 
key component that the firm considers high priority. 
Cyber security risk 
Cyber security is the risk of not protecting computer 
systems, networks and data from digital attacks, 
FLOW TRADERS | HALF YEAR REPORT 2025  
 
 
 
 
 
 
18

## Page 20

unauthorized access and therefore posing damage 
or disruption to the firm. 
Cyber security risk management is the process of 
identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and addressing an 
organization's cyber security threats. The goal is to 
protect the organization's information systems from 
cyber attacks and data breaches while minimizing 
potential damage. The cyber security risk category 
was established together with the formalization of 
the risk appetite for 2025 to ensure a more focused 
approach to mitigating related cyber and 
information security risks. 
As of January 2025, Flow Traders is compliant with 
the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). The 
Company delivered their documentation to the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) in a 
timely manner and were approved accordingly. 
Internal Audit (IA) 
The IA function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and 
objective assurance, advice, and insight. An effective 
IA contributes to strong internal controls and to a 
robust governance structure, which can address key 
structural risks. 
The scope of IA's work includes the examination and 
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of our  
risk management, control and governance 
processes. It also includes quality assurance work 
reviewing our performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve our stated goals and 
objectives.
Our Group IA Charter defines the IA’s purpose, 
authority, responsibility and position within the 
organization. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance 
provided by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).
The IA function is an integral part of our reporting 
cycle and reports to the Audit Committee and to the 
CEO. It aligns its efforts with our external auditor and 
reports its audit results to the Board, the Audit 
Committee and informs the external auditor.
The Board assesses the way in which the IA function 
fulfills its responsibility annually and takes the 
opinion of the Audit Committee into account. 
Flow Traders IA’s function conforms to the 
International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) 
of the IIA.

Sustainability information 
General basis of preparation for the 
sustainability information  
The sustainability information in this Half-Year 
Report covers the material topics identified following 
our 2024 Double Materiality Assessment (DMA).
This information complies with the Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive (NFRD) and the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation.
We continue to monitor developments in relation to 
the adoption of the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive within Dutch legislation and the 
implications of the European Commissions’ Omnibus 
announcement in February 2025. 
Governance of sustainability matters
We have established a governance structure that 
oversees the rollout of our ESG priorities, along with 
their associated impacts, risks, and opportunities 
(IROs). 
We manage sustainability through this structure that 
spans across multiple organizational levels, ensuring 
accountability and execution. This includes the 
Board, the Risk & Sustainability Committee, theme 
owners and KPI action owners. 
Sustainability expertise
Collectively the Board has a sufficient level of 
knowledge of sustainability to oversee its 
governance. 
Risk management of sustainability matters
Sustainability and environmental risk are defined in 
our internal policies as the risk that ESG (related) 
issues or events will impact the entity financially, 
non-financially and/or in the realization of strategic 
objectives of the entity. Our leadership is charged 
with monitoring the sustainability and 
environmental risks via the Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework. Environmental and 
sustainability risks are monitored by our second line 
of defense.
Double materiality assessment (DMA)
The DMA serves as the foundation for prioritizing the 
sustainability matters most relevant to us and our 
stakeholders.
Our stakeholders include individuals and groups 
affected by our activities, those with a (in)direct 
interest in our operations and value chain, 
comprising of our end-to-end operational partners 
such as exchanges, counterparties, prime brokers 
etc., and those who influence our long and short 
term success.

## Page 22

Preparation of sustainability information
Our materiality framework is designed to reflect the 
requirements from, among others, the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), DMA 
guidance and industry best practices. We conduct a 
comprehensive DMA every three years, 
supplemented by annual reviews of our material 
topics in light of new insights, evolving stakeholder 
expectations, shifts in the regulatory landscape, and 
the progress we have achieved. 
In late 2023, we completed a comprehensive 
materiality assessment based on double materiality 
principles. In 2024 our DMA was updated, the 
material topics identified were first reported in 2024. 
Flow Traders has performance indicators to track 
progress toward its long-terms sustainability goals. 
The scope for the sustainability information in this 
report, spans multiple locations across three 
continents, EMEA, APAC, and the Americas, with key 
trading hubs in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and New 
York. When it comes to the environmental GHG 
footprint of our operations, the majority of our 
impact comes from our three largest offices 
(Amsterdam, Hong Kong and New York).
There has been no significant update on the risk, 
uncertainties or policies used as part of our 
sustainability framework in the first six months of this 
year.

Flow Traders’ themes
Environmental footprint
Our environmental priorities
We are committed to supporting the global 
transition toward a sustainable, climate-neutral 
economy by minimizing our environmental impact. 
To this end, we are committed to reducing the 
environmental footprint of our business operations.
Our business activities do not involve manufacturing, 
so our GHG footprint is relatively low. Most of our 
electricity consumption is tied to office operations, 
including lighting, temperature control, and 
electronic devices. In terms of carbon footprint, we 
identify three impact areas:
▪
The indirect scope 2 GHG emissions from the 
electricity consumption in our offices
▪
The indirect scope 3 GHG emissions from business 
travel (cat. 6) and employee commute (cat. 7)
▪
The indirect scope 3 GHG emissions from our data 
center services suppliers (cat. 1) 
Our direct scope 1 GHG emissions from fossil fuels are 
minimal. Our office buildings use electricity for 
heating. Our focus begins with what we can directly 
control: decarbonizing our own operations. Looking 
ahead, climate action will be essential for partnering 
with high-value, reputable chains, making a well- 
defined strategy with realistic objectives crucial to 
our ambition
EU Taxonomy 
The EU Taxonomy is a centerpiece of the EU actions 
to support the transition to a sustainable economy, in 
which the financial sector plays a vital role. It aims to 
provide a basis for harmonized and comparable 
disclosures related to economic activities that 
qualifies as environmentally sustainable. 
Applicable reporting requirements
Reporting requirements for Flow Traders: In 
compliance with section 2.4. of Annex VII Disclosures 
Delegated Act (DDA), investment firms should 
compute the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) for their 
services and activities dealing on own account by 
relying on the turnover KPI and CapEx KPI of 
investee undertakings for each environmental 
objective.
EU Taxonomy reporting
In light of the ongoing regulatory developments — 
particularly the adoption of the Omnibus Delegated 
Act on 4 July 2025, and the expected changes under 
the Content Directive and broader EU Taxonomy 
framework — we will continue to monitor 
developments and the regulatory landscape closely. 
We intend to reassess our reporting position and 
approach in line with future regulatory 
developments and stakeholder expectations during 
the annual report cycle. This includes evaluating the 
applicability of the new materiality thresholds, 
simplified templates, and other reliefs introduced 
under the evolving framework.

Sustainable employment
As society evolves, so does our Company. Over the 
past two decades we have grown into a global 
trading firm with an entrepreneurial spirit. We strive 
to continuously understand and address the needs of 
our team, always focusing on enhancing our culture 
and making Flow Traders the best place to work.
We are committed to fostering an international, 
diverse, and empowering environment centered on 
teamwork, collaboration, and talent development. To 
sustain our business success, it is essential that our 
employees take pride in being part of our Company 
and feel connected to our goals. Every individual 
plays a vital role, and our leadership is dedicated to 
providing clear direction and recognizing top talent.
How we can contribute - our people strategy
The competition for talent in the labor market is 
intense, especially for the individuals we want to 
attract and retain. Therefore, keeping our best talent 
on board is critical. The need to foster engagement 
across our employee base and ensure a diverse and 
inclusive work environment has become more 
important. We prioritize retention while at the same 
time focus on attracting new talent. This is how we 
deliver on our ‘People’ mission; ‘Empower the best to

gender expression, disability, economic status and 
other diverse backgrounds. 
Human Rights Policy
We are committed to upholding internationally 
recognized human rights standards across our 
operations, supply chains, and the communities in 
which we operate. We are dedicated to protecting 
the human rights of our workforce and other 
stakeholders. We oppose forced labor, child labor, 
and human trafficking across our workforce. Our 
Human Rights Policy, established by Flow Traders 
Ltd., applies to all employees, contingent workers, 
subsidiaries, and business partners. We align with 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human

Good governance 
Establishing a risk aware culture is crucial for 
building the right structures and preventing 
misconduct. This culture is driven by leadership tone, 
accountability, and open communication. Leadership 
must set the right example through role modelling 
our core values, shaping the ethical foundation our 
Company. 
How we can contribute
Our commitment to ethical behavior is laid down in 
our Code of Conduct, which is based on our values 
and how we define our corporate culture. We expect 
every employee to uphold to the Code of Conduct, 
ensuring a safe working environment and a respect 
for human rights. We embed our core values into 
business conduct, providing guidance through 
shared beliefs, a clear purpose, mission, norms, and 
transparent ways of working. A strong ethical 
foundation mitigates risks such as: misconduct, non-
compliance, business disruption, legal challenges 
and reputational damage.
Flow Traders has in place processes for identifying, 
reporting and addressing incidents of non-
compliance with its Code of Conduct. Within every 
department in Flow Traders there is an incident 
reporting policy that drives this process so that any 
behavior that contradicts our Code of Conduct is 
identified and investigated. 
Business conduct and corporate culture
Business conduct and our culture is at the core of 
everything we do. We operate within a highly 
regulated market. Upholding the highest ethical 
standards and adhering to our own policies and 
procedures is central to our business conduct and 
corporate culture. We enforce a zero-tolerance policy 
for any form of undesirable behavior and have 
reporting procedures in place to address and resolve 
issues, ensuring accountability to all stakeholders. 
These reporting procedures are set out in the policies  
below. 
Policies related to governance  
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy 
Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABC) Policy 
sets our commitment to and the standards for 
preventing bribery and corruption, while ensuring 
that any concerns about unlawful behavior are 
identified, reported, and investigated. This policy is 
aligned with the UN Convention against corruption.  
Every employee is responsible for upholding honesty 
and ethical conduct in all aspects of their work, as 
outlined in our ABC Policy. It is both a right and a 
duty to report any suspected abuse to the 
Compliance department or anonymously to the 
Trusted Person, without fear of retaliation.
Please see our Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption 
Policy on our website. Read more in section: Risk 
management - Compliance and ethical risk. 
Our five cultural pillars define our identity
Wherever we operate, we believe that honesty and 
the highest standards of integrity are fundamental to 
creating value for our stakeholders and ensuring our 
long-term success. Our corporate policies and 
procedures, which detail our principles and 
compliance standards, serve as a compass for 
making the right decisions and staying true to our 
values. Please refer to the corporate documents 
section on our website.

provider with its core business in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) actively 
expanding in fixed income, FX, commodities and digital assets, while 
systemically increasing its presence in the global ecosystem through strategic 
partnerships and investments.
2. Basis of preparation 
a) Statement of compliance
The Group applies IFRS accounting standards as adopted by the European Union 
(‘IFRS Accounting Standards’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS 
Accounting Standards provide several options in accounting principles. The 
Group’s accounting principles and its decisions regarding the options available 
are set out in the section ‘material accounting policies’ below.
These Interim condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) 34 
Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. They do not 
include all the information required for a complete set of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements. However, selected explanatory 
notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an 
understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance 
since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year 
ended 31 December 2024.
b) Material accounting policies
With the exception of the policy detailed below, the same accounting and 
methods of computation that were applied in the most recent annual Group's 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 have 
been applied to the Interim condensed financial statements for the six-month 
period ended 30 June 2025, except for the adoption of new standards or 
amendments effective as of 1 January 2025. The Group has not early adopted any 
standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet 
effective.
During the period ended 30 June 2025, the Group acquired assets which 
represent a new Investment class within intangible assets. These intangible 
assets are indefinite-life assets and measured at cost less impairment. Given the 
nature of these intangible assets, the Group performs a review for circumstances 
which indicate that the carrying value may be impaired on a continuous basis.  
Impairment is measured with reference to the individual asset’s recoverable 
amount and the individual asset’s carrying value. The recoverable amount is 
based on the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). FVLCD is measured with 
reference to an active market bid price and a discount for lack of marketability 
(DLOM). 
Any impairments within this class of intangible assets is presented within 
(Reversal of) impairment of intangible assets on the Interim condensed 
consolidated statement of profit or loss. Any reversals of historical impairments 
are presented within the same line. Upon disposal, any difference between the 
net proceeds and the carrying value at sale completion is recognized within 
Other income or (expense) on the Interim condensed consolidated statement of 
profit or loss.

3. Restatement of prior period errors
Restatement 1
The Interim condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as at 30 June 2024 
has been restated for the effect of incorrect recognition of certain derivative 
contracts. For these contracts only an asset or liability should had been 
recognized depending on the contract’s gain or loss position. However, notional 
amounts have been incorrectly recognized as both assets and liabilities, despite 
not meeting the recognition criteria in IFRS 9. Additionally, these derivative 
contracts were previously presented within trading receivables and trading 
payables and should have been presented as financial assets or liabilities held for 
trading. There was nil impact on the Interim condensed consolidated statement 
of financial position as at 31 December 2024 and the Interim condensed 
consolidated statement of profit or loss as the restatement had been included in 
the 2024 Annual Report. Additionally, there was nil impact on retained earnings.
Restatement 2
The Interim condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as at 30 June 2024 
has been restated for the effect of incorrect presentation for stablecoins (digital 
assets) as trading receivables and trading payables. Digital assets are presented 
as other assets and liabilities held for trading and accounted for as inventory 
under IAS 2. Trading receivables and trading payables are financial assets and 
liabilities accounted for under IFRS 9. There was nil impact on the Interim 
condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024 
and the Interim condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss as the 
restatement had been included in the 2024 Annual Report. Additionally, there 
was nil impact on retained earnings.
Please see the following table for impact on the Interim condensed consolidated 
statement of cash flows.

4. New standards and interpretations 
The Group has assessed all new amendments and interpretations that are 
relevant to its operations and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2025. These amendments and interpretations do not have an impact on 
the Interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The Group continues to identify all impacts of IFRS 18 on the primary financial 
statements and notes to the financial statements. The standard is effective for 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027. It is not expected that the 
Group will early adopt the standard. 
5. Operating segments
The chief operating decision makers of the Group (Executive Directors of the 
Board) examine performance from a regional perspective and have identified 
FLOW TRADERS | HALF YEAR REPORT 2025  
 
 
 
 
 
 
35

## Page 37

three reportable segments of its global trading business: Europe, the Americas 
and Asia.
Europe consists of activities in the Netherlands with institutional trading 
activities in France, UK, Italy, trading activities in Jersey and internal IT activities 
in Romania. Americas consists of the subsidiaries in the USA. Asia contains our 
subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore and a Chinese representative office in 
Shanghai. The Executive Directors of the Board consider this segmentation to be 
relevant to understand the Group’s financial performance because it allows 
investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate 
the operating performance and decision making about allocation of resources 
and trading capital.
The Group measures results on an IFRS basis and reconciles the total segment 
results on net trading income, profit before tax and net profit. Significant 
transactions and balances between geographic regions occur primarily as result 
of Group operating companies incurring the operating expenses such as 
employee compensation, communication, software development, data 
processing and overhead costs for the purpose of providing services to affiliated 
operating companies (line items intercompany recharge income and expenses).

6. Fair value measurement
Valuation models 
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement 
that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer 
the liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants 
at the measurement date. 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, 
depending on the inputs used for making the measurements.
▪
Level 1: fair value of financial instruments based upon inputs that are quoted, 
unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical instruments;
▪
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in 
active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are not considered active; or other valuation 
techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable 
from market data;
▪
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments 
for which the valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a 
significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes 
instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments 
but for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are 
FLOW TRADERS | HALF YEAR REPORT 2025  
 
 
 
 
 
 
37


---

## Page 39

required to reflect differences between the instruments, for example unlisted 
equity securities.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active 
markets are based on prices obtained directly from an exchange on which the 
instruments are traded or obtained from a broker that provides an unadjusted 
quoted price from an active market for identical instruments. For all other 
financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation 
techniques.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on 
the basis of net exposures to market risks, it applies judgment in determining 
appropriate portfolio-level adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such 
adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask spreads for similar instruments 
and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. 
Similarly, when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial 
liabilities on the basis of net exposure to the credit risk of a particular 
counterparty, it takes into account any existing arrangements that mitigate the 
credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty).

Implied 
Volatility 
(80%-120%)
If implied volatility were to 
increase, the fair value

The discount for lack of marketability is driven by factors which include the 
contractual terms of each investment as well as time elapsed. Due to this, the 
range of DLOMs used as of the reporting date will change year over year to 
reflect the portfolio as of the reporting date.
A reasonably possible alternative assumption to the illiquidity discount is an 
increase or decrease of the percentage by 5% (2024: 5%). For investments 
measured at FVPL, this would increase/decrease the total fair value by €0.4 
million (30 June 2024: €1.1 million) and for investments measured at FVOCI, this 
would increase/decrease the total fair value by a €0.2 million (30 June 2024: €0.5 
million). 
A reasonably possible alternative assumption for applying the range of implied 
volatility would be to apply a 120% implied volatility for all other liabilities held for 
trading measured using a significant unobservable input of implied volatility. 
This would result in an increase in the total fair value of other liabilities held for 
trading by €1.6 million (30 June 2024: 0.7 million). If those instruments were to all 
have an 80% implied volatility, the impact would be a decrease in the total fair 
value of other liabilities held for trading of €2.7 million (30 June 2024: €0.9 
million). 
a. Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The valuation of trading positions, both long and short positions, is determined 
by reference to last traded prices from identical instruments from the exchanges 
at the reporting date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are 
carried at fair value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted 
market prices. The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused 
by the fact that the Group continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities 
based on all available information. This includes prices for identical and near-
identical positions, as well as the prices for securities underlying the Group’s 
positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on which the 
financial asset or liability is primarily traded closes. Consequently, such financial 
assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to 
determine fair value.

b. Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income is determined by reference to their quoted closing bid 
price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation 
technique and are classified as Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular 
availability of quoted closing bid prices. 
c. Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through profit or loss is 
determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, 
or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique and are classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular availability of quoted closing bid 
prices.
d. Other assets held for trading 
Other assets held for trading comprises the amount of digital assets that the 
Group holds as a broker-dealer. The Group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets that 
are held for sale in the ordinary course of business and these are measured at fair 
value less cost to sell with fair value changes recognized in profit or loss. The 
Group uses its own fair value models based on quoted prices or observable 
inputs for the valuation of the digital assets, these assets are classified as Level 2. 
e. Other liabilities held for trading
The Group borrows digital assets as part of its trading strategy. The borrowed 
digital assets are measured at fair value less cost to sell. As the Group uses its 
own fair value models based on quoted prices, observable inputs or 
unobservable inputs for the valuation of the borrowed digital assets, these 
liabilities are classified as Level 2 and Level 3. When the borrowed digital assets 
have an embedded derivative, the Group values the derivative using an option 
pricing model. See note 6 for additional information about the significant Level 3 
inputs used.

7.  Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to ordinary 
shareholders with the number of ordinary shares outstanding. 
The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted 
average effect of changes in treasury shares (repurchased and re-issued by the 
Group) during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the basic earnings per 
share for the effects of all dilutive share-based payments to employees.

variable employee expenses. The increase in variable employee expenses is 
reflective of the increase in financial performance in the current period. The 
amount of variable compensation payable is based on the operational profit of 
the Group. Variable compensation costs are based on existing variable 
compensation obligations as well as expected variable compensation for the 
period.

a) Variable remuneration share plans - equity settled
Under the variable remuneration share plans, shares are granted to employees 
as part of their variable compensation. The shares vest in four equal installments 
during the first quarter of the subsequent year over a period of three or four 
years subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on the 
vesting date.
At year-end employees are granted shares based on a fixed monetary value. The 
number of shares granted is estimated based on the monetary value divided by 
the fair value of the share price at grant date. The final number of shares granted 
are determined based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the first 
open period of the following year, resulting in an updated calculation of the 
shares awarded, as is shown in the tables below. These awards have a nil exercise 
price.

period of one to four years, depending on the share plan and agreement with 
the employee, subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on 
the vesting date. 
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date. The weighted 
average fair value of shares granted during the period ended 30 June 2025 was 
of €23.88 (2024: €17.53). The exercise price of the share option is equal to the 
market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The expense 
recognized during the period was €0.2 million (2024: €0.4 million).

c) Share appreciation rights - cash settled
Certain employees are awarded share appreciation rights (SARs) as part of their 
variable remuneration, settled in cash. The SARs vest in equal installments over a 
period of three to four years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The liability for the SARs is measured, initially and 
at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the SARs. The 
carrying amount of the liability relating to the SARs at 30 June 2025 was €3.8 
million (31 December 2024: €7.2 million). The expense recognized during the 
period was €2 million (30 June 2024: €1.4 million).

19. Intangible assets
With reference to the policy described in note 2, €4.7 million (2024: nil) of the 
€6.6 million (2024: €2.0 million) Intangible assets on the Interim condensed 
consolidated statement of financial position represents Investment class 
intangible assets. During the period ended 30 June 2025, €17.3 million of 
Investment class intangible assets were acquired in non-cash transactions as a 
result of exercising legal rights from previous investments. 
The carrying value of the individual intangible assets within this class of 
intangible assets is reviewed on a continuous basis with their estimated 
recoverable amount based on fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). The 
estimate of the FVLCD uses a market approach valuation technique which is 
most sensitive to a Level 3 input of a DLOM. The DLOM is driven by factors which 
include contractual terms of each investment as well as time elapsed. Due to 
this, the range of DLOMs used as of the reporting date will change year over year 
to reflect the portfolio of investment class intangible assets as of the reporting 
date. As of 30 June 2025, the range of DLOM was 30% to 70%.
During the period ended 30 June 2025, impairment expense of €8.0 million 
(2024: nil), which is the net impairment expense after reversals of impairment of 
€3.0 million, was recognized in the Investment class intangible assets and 
presented within the (Reversal of) impairment of intangible assets on the Interim 
condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss. The events which lead to the 
impairment charge were the underperformance of the capital markets 
experienced in early 2025. 
Disposals of €3.8 million in Investment class intangible assets resulted in a gain 
of €0.1 million which was recognized in Other income or (expense) on the 
Interim condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Credit facilities
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to 
facilitate the trading activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of 
financial instruments). The drawn amounts on these facilities continuously 
fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given moment.
The Group has interest-bearing credit facilities with its prime brokers and 
clearing institutions for a total facilities amount of €4,528 million as at 30 June 
2025. The variable interest rate charged on these facilities is based on the 
overnight interest rates per respective currency plus 50 bps. These facilities can 
be modified or terminated at any time and do not have an expiration date and 
are yearly automatically renewed. The facilities are exclusively for the financing of 
positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary course of the trading 
activities using the various prime brokers.
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin 
requirements (representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is 
variable and calculated on a daily basis depending on portfolio size and 
composition) in cash or securities as security for our positions held with the 
relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements. 
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities, the Group is required 
to comply with a net liquidation (or trading capital) balance that exceeds the 
haircut calculated by the prime broker. Both the net liquidation balance and 
haircut are variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio size 
FLOW TRADERS | HALF YEAR REPORT 2025

## Page 48

and composition. The main covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to 
loan size (variable and calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio 
composition). In addition, for certain operating subsidiaries of the Group, they 
require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%, calculated by shareholders' 
equity divided by credit limit for the respective subsidiaries.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with 
financial statements and other information, including information on our trading 
activities and trading counterparties. Furthermore, they require us to maintain 
all relevant authorizations and memberships required in order to conduct our 
business, and comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and place 
restrictions on mergers and disposition of our assets outside the ordinary course 
of our business.
Other covenants related to credit facilities provided by prime brokers and 
clearing institutions mainly include ratios in respect of shareholders’ equity for 
the Group and Flow Traders B.V., as well as a minimum regulatory capital ratio 
for Flow Traders B.V.
The Group has not had any defaults and did not breach any covenants with 
respect to any of its liabilities during 2025 and 2024.

Guarantees
The Group did not enter into any new guarantees with external counter-parties 
during the six months ended 30 June 2025. Additionally, the Group has not 
amended or extinguished any guarantees with external counterparties which 
were previously disclosed as of 31 December 2024. 
Contingent liabilities
The Group is not involved in any significant and material legal other procedures 
and/or claims.
The Group’s calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the 
application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across EMEA, Asia, 
and the Americas. In this context, it is possible that tax exposures which have not 
yet materialized may result in different interpretation of local rules. As of 31 
December 2024, management concluded that it is probable that the tax 
authority in the Netherlands will accept our treatment of earnings stripping 
rules. It is possible that different interpretation of local rules may result in tax 
effects from timing differences. 
Significant restrictions
The Group does not have significant restrictions on its ability to access or use its 
assets and settle its liabilities other than those resulting from the supervisory 
frameworks within which its subsidiaries operate. Please refer to the Capital 
Management section of this report for more information.
27.Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial 
liabilities that:
▪
are offset in the Group’s Consolidated statement of financial position; or
▪
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar 
agreement that covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether 
they are offset in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master 
repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. 
Similar financial instruments include derivatives, sales and repurchase 
agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and 
securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, such as loans and 
deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
Consolidated statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for 
offsetting in the Consolidated statement of financial position. This is because 
they create a right to offset recognized amounts for the parties to the agreement 
that is enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of 
the Group or the counterparties or following other predetermined events.
In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net 
basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can 
receive and grant collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in 
respect of the following transactions:
▪
derivatives;
▪
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
▪
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable 
securities as set out in notes 14 and # in respect of derivatives (including swaps). 
Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms including, where 
appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities received/
granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction, 
but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each 
party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure 
to post collateral.

Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to 
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include: 
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and 
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar 
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to offset liabilities against 
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event of 
the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or 
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount 
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit exposure. 
However, the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 are not met in all cases.

Independent auditor’s review report
To: the shareholders and the board of Flow Traders 
Ltd.
Our conclusion
We have reviewed the 2025 Interim Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements (the “interim 
condensed consolidated financial statements”) 
included in the accompanying Condensed 
Consolidated Half-Year Report 2025 of Flow Traders 
Ltd. (hereinafter also referred to as: the company), 
registered in Bermuda, for the period from 1 January 
2025 to 30 June 2025. 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the interim 
condensed consolidated financial statements of Flow 
Traders Ltd. for the period from 1 January 2025 to 30 
June 2025, is not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” 
as adopted in the European Union.
The interim condensed consolidated financial 
statements comprise:
▪
The interim condensed consolidated statement of 
financial position as at 30 June 2025
▪
The following interim condensed consolidated 
statements for the period from 1 January 2025 to 
30 June 2025: the statements of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income, changes in equity 
and cash flows
▪
The supplementary notes comprising material 
accounting policy information and selected 
explanatory information
Basis for our conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with Dutch 
law, including the Dutch Standard 2410, “Het 
beoordelen van tussentijdse financiële informatie 
door de accountant van de entiteit” (Review of 
interim financial information performed by the 
independent auditor of the entity). A review of 
interim financial information in accordance with the 
Dutch Standard 2410 is a limited assurance 
engagement.  Our responsibilities under this 
standard are further described in the Our 
responsibilities for the review of the interim 
condensed consolidated financial statements section 
of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders Ltd. in 
accordance with the Verordening inzake de 
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-
opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect to 
independence) and other relevant independence 
regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we 
have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en 
beroepsregels accountants  (VGBA, Dutch Code of 
Ethics for Professional Accountants).
We believe the assurance evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our conclusion.
Responsibilities of the board for the 
interim condensed consolidated financial 
statements
The board is responsible for the preparation and 
presentation of the interim condensed consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, 
“Interim Financial Reporting” as adopted in the 
European Union. Furthermore, the board is 
responsible for such internal control as it determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of the interim 
condensed consolidated financial statements that is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
The Audit Committee undertakes preparatory work 
for the board’s decision-making regarding the 
supervision of the integrity and quality of the 
company’s financial reporting. Working within the 
board, the Audit Committee is charged in particular 
with the supervision with respect to the provision of 
financial information by Flow Traders Ltd.
Our responsibilities for the review of the 
interim condensed consolidated financial 
statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the review 
in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and 
appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusion. 
The level of assurance obtained in a review 
engagement is substantially less than the level of 
assurance obtained in an audit conducted in 
accordance with the Dutch Standards on Auditing. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
We have exercised professional judgement and have 
maintained professional skepticism throughout the 
review in accordance with Dutch law, including the 
Dutch Standard 2410. Our review included among 
others:
▪
Updating our understanding of the company and 
its environment, including its internal control, and 
the applicable financial reporting framework, in 
order to identify areas in the interim condensed 
consolidated financial statements where material 
misstatements are likely to arise due to fraud or 
error, designing and performing analytical and

and obtaining assurance evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our conclusion
▪
Obtaining an understanding of internal control as 
it relates to the preparation of the interim 
condensed consolidated financial statements
▪
Making inquiries of the board and others within 
the company
▪

information included in the interim condensed

▪
Evaluating the assurance evidence obtained
▪

changes in accounting principles or in the 
methods of applying them and whether any new 
transactions have necessitated the application of 
a new accounting principle
▪
Considering whether the board has identified all 
events that may require adjustment to or 
disclosure in the interim condensed consolidated 
financial statements
▪
Considering whether the interim condensed 
consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting framework and represent the 
underlying transactions free from material 
misstatement

"plan," "predict," "may," "will," "would," "should," "continue," "expect," and similar expressions, though not exclusively. 
Such forward-looking statements are to involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important 
factors that could cause circumstances or actual outcomes, results, performance, or achievements to differ 
materially from any future circumstances, results, performance or achievements expressed or implied. Key factors 
that may affect these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: reduced levels of overall trading 
volumes and lower margins; dependence on prime brokers, ETP issuers, trading counterparties, central 
counterparties (CCPs), and custodians; potential loss of access to important exchange or other trading venues; 
occurrence of systemic market events; incurrence of trading losses; disruptions or failures of our trading platform or 
third-party technical infrastructure; operational risks and challenges inherent to our business and trading activities; 
ineffective risk management systems processes and strategies; intense industry competition; reliance on 
continuous access to liquidity sources; capacity constraints in computer and communication systems; dependence 
on third-party software, infrastructure, or software availability; damage to our reputation and the reputation of our 
industry; loss of key staff or failure to attract and loss of key personnel or challenges in attracting and retaining 
skilled professionals; changes to applicable regulatory requirements; compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations specific to our industry; and enhanced media and regulatory scrutiny affecting public perception 
among other risks. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions, beliefs, and expectations derived 
from our industry experience, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future 
developments, and other factors we deem appropriate. Furthermore, any sustainability-related statements—
pertaining to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations—are based on the best evidence and 
information available to us at the time of this report. These statements, including those regarding future 
opportunities or risks, are inherently uncertain and subject to change as our understanding of ESG factors evolves. 
From a quantitative perspective, some of our sustainability metrics, such as emissions calculations, rely on estimates 
and external sources, including conversion factors. These estimates are based on current methodologies and 
sources, which may vary, leading to potential adjustments in reported figures over time. As such, the figures 
presented in this report should be understood as estimates that could change depending on the data sources or 
methods employed. While we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking and sustainability 
statements are reasonable as of the date they are made, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Therefore, you are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange 
regulations, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or 
sustainability metrics, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Any forward-looking 
statements should not be interpreted as guarantees of future performance or outcomes. If the risks or uncertainties 
materialize, or if the assumptions underlying our forward -looking statements prove inaccurate, our actual 
operational results, financial condition or sustainability outcomes could differ significantly from those anticipated, 
believed, estimated or expected. Statements regarding the market, industry trends, including the FX market, 
developments in ETP Assets under Management in specific markets, ETP value traded in certain markets and Flow 
Traders’ competitive position, are based on external data and sources. As these sources and methodologies evolve, 
so too may the information we present.
