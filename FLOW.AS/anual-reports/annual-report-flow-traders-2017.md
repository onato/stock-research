Profile
Who we are
We are a leading global financial technology-enabled 
liquidity provider, with a focus on exchange traded products 
(ETPs). Our trading desks in Europe, the Americas and Asia 
provide liquidity across all major exchanges, globally, 24 
hours a day. With 399 employees (394 FTEs) at year-end, we 
continued to build our organization in 2017. Founded in 
2004, we cultivate the entrepreneurial, innovative and 
team-oriented culture that has been with us since the 
beginning.
What we do
As a technology company operating in the financial services 
industry, we use our proprietary technology platform to 
quote bid and ask prices in thousands of ETP listings, as well 
as similar financial products. We also provide liquidity to 
institutional counterparties off-exchange across all regions. 
Liquidity provision makes markets more efficient and 
transparent, promoting better execution quality and lower 
overall trading costs for market participants. 
As a principal trading firm, we trade for our own account and 
own risk only. We do not have clients, nor do we provide any 
investment services or ancillary services to others. 
Our strategies are designed to use information that is 
publicly available and we use fairly simple, non-controversial 
and transparent order types. We are a strong supporter of 
fair, transparent and orderly markets. We derive our Net 
Trading Income (NTI) from the small price differences at 
which investors are willing to trade ETPs or other financial 
instruments and those of the underlying or related financial 
instruments at which we hedge the resulting exposures. 
We do not have a directional opinion on the markets and aim 
to be hedged perfectly and instantaneously. This focus on 
risk management is at the heart of our organization, and our 
risk functions are closely integrated into our platform.

Message of the Management Board
2017 was a year in which we witnessed subdued investor 
activity on the markets, leading to reduced market activity. 
Internally, our focus continued to be on long-term value 
creation. As well as launching the new FX trading desk, we 
opened an office in Hong Kong, continued to grow our 
institutional counterparty base, and laid the groundwork for 
future expansion into new markets. At the same time, we 
ensured we are fully prepared for the introduction of MiFID 
II, and continued to invest in our people and unique culture. 
Market developments
Market volatility in 2017 was defined by record lows. 
A variety of macro-economic issues linked to both US 
domestic politics and foreign affairs, as well as international 
ECB developments, suppressed trading activity. 
This resulted in investors focusing on liquid products rather 
than choosing to diversify or alter their investment 
strategies. 
 Long-term value creation 
During the course of the year, we continued to focus on our 
strategy of seizing opportunities and creating long-term 
value. One example is our move into providing liquidity to FX 
markets, which will enable us to increase efficiency and 
create a more level playing field for investors. In Asia, we 
opened an office in Hong Kong that will increase our 
footprint and visibility in the region, contributing to the 
company’s future growth. In the US, we continued to grow 
the number of institutional counterparties we are connected 
to. And in Europe, by investing in and improving our 
infrastructure, we again managed to secure a healthy share 
of the market. We also worked diligently on supporting the 
company’s unique culture. For example, we launched Flow 
Academy, a platform that promotes knowledge sharing 
across the business, and introduced an employee equity 
plan. From a regulatory standpoint, we continued to prepare 
for the upcoming introduction of MiFID II, which we believe 
will create more market transparency and lead to a situation 
where the best price wins.
Creating efficiencies
As well as executing our business model as effectively as 
possible, we also focused on executing it as efficiently as 
possible. Improving the quality of pricing and the quality of 
processes means we will be in a better position to scale our 
business into other asset classes. At the same time, cost 
efficiency insights will enable us to move away from 
strategies that provide limited returns on investment. 
Focus in 2018
Looking forward, our focus in 2018 will be building on and 
scaling up our current activities. We will also continue to 
maintain a constructive dialogue with regulators, which we 
believe will lead to a more level playing field across markets. 
Following another successful year, we would like to extend 
our thanks to the dedicated team at Flow Traders, as well as 
our shareholders and other stakeholders, for their ongoing 
support and contribution.
Regards,
Dennis Dijkstra, Sjoerd Rietberg and Marcel Jongmans.

Dividend policy and dividend proposal 
Dividend policy
Flow Traders intends to pay dividends annually in two 
instalments, with a target aggregate dividend pay-out ratio 
of at least 50 percent of the company’s net profits realized 
during the financial year. The Management Board may 
decide, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, that the 
profits realized during a financial year will fully or partially 
be appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. 
A distribution of (interim) dividends is subject to applicable 
rules and regulations, the Articles of Association of the 
company, the By-Laws of the Management Board, and the 
By-Laws of the Supervisory Board.
It is anticipated that our interim dividends will be declared 
and paid following the publication of our results for the first 
half of each year. However, there can be no assurance that in 
any given year a dividend will be proposed or declared.

The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and 
timing thereof will depend on a number of factors, including 
future profits, financial conditions, general economic and 
business conditions, future prospects and such other factors 
as the Management Board, subject to the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, may deem relevant as well as other legal 
and regulatory requirements. Our intentions in relation to 
dividends are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control.
The Management Board, subject to the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, may decide to make allocations to 
reserves and therefore decides how much of the profit will 
be allocated to reserves. The profits remaining shall be at 
the disposal of the General Meeting. For 2017, the 
Management Board has proposed to increase the total 
dividend payout ratio to at least 75%.

Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the company’s Articles of

for the financial year 2017, subject to a 15 percent dividend 
withholding tax (dividendbelasting). An interim cash

We provide liquidity in financial products, with a 
focus on exchange-traded products (ETPs). 
ETPs are baskets of securities made up of shares, 
bonds, or commodities. ETPs often track indices 
and, unlike most mutual funds, can be traded 
throughout the day on trading venues. We do this 
globally, enabling investors to buy and sell ETPs 
efficiently by quoting bid and ask prices under 
virtually all market circumstances.
Markets & Trends
Our business
We trade in well over 10,000 financial instruments, and have 
access to more than 100 trading venues in 36 countries 
around the world. We provide liquidity in over 5,500 ETP 
listings on- and off-exchange.
Off-exchange, we provide liquidity in ETPs on a request-
for-quote basis to over 700 institutional counterparties 
across the globe, including banks, asset managers, pension 
funds, insurance companies, family offices, hedge funds, 
and others in 36 countries and their number increases 
almost daily. Besides ETPs, we provide liquidity in similar 
instruments, whose value is correspondingly affected by 
a change in the value of their underlying assets.
As a liquidity provider, we do not have an opinion on the 
market. In other words, our results do not depend on the 
direction of market prices. Our Net Trading Income is 
realized through the small price differences between the 
ETPs and other financial instruments we buy or sell, and the 
prices we pay or receive for the underlying or related 
financial instruments to mitigate our risk.
The ETP market
The popularity of ETPs has continued to increase in the 
recent years. According to asset manager BlackRock 
Advisors, global ETP Assets under Management (AuM) grew 
from €3,323 billion in 2016 to € 3,962 billion by the end of 
2017. And this growth is expected to continue, with sources 
such as BlackRock, PwC, Boston Consulting Group and EY 
predicting the market will more than double to over €6 
trillion by 2020, as investors continue to invest in low-cost, 
transparent and easy-to-trade passive investment 
strategies.
We believe there are a number of reasons for this trend to 
continue, also after 2020: one is that investors are attracted 
to the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables them to 
follow clearly how the underlying securities are performing. 
Another is that ETPs are liquid and available at low costs, 
and can be bought and sold easily during market hours. 
A third reason is that ETPs can be composed of financial 
instruments from almost any asset class, sector or location, 
giving investors access to markets that would normally be 
difficult to reach.
Review of 2017
Global ETP markets continued to gain strength and grew by 
19 percent in 2017 measured in AuM. Annual global inflows 
of ETP AuM were €639 billion in 2017 (2016: €345 billion – 
source BlackRock Global ETP Landscape December 2017), 
driven by record investments in fixed income – and equity 
products. Overall trading activity in 2017 slowed down 
further, reaching levels not witnessed in over 30 years, as 
investors reduced diversification in their trading strategies, 
given economic developments and Central Bank policies. 
Flows in fixed income were €130 billion in 2017 (2016: €105 
billion - source BlackRock Global ETP Landscape December 
2017) signifying a growth of 23.3 percent, which can be 
largely attributed to investors’ appetite for better 
investments in fixed income themes through ETFs.

In Asia we continue to increase our participation in the 
markets where we are already active and expand into new 
markets. At the same time, we remain focused on markets 
that are potentially opening up, such as China, by capitalizing 
on our experience and increasing our business development 
capacities. In order to facilitate our future growth, we 
opened an office in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter, 
increasing our footprint and visibility in the region, 
supporting our institutional trading and reaffirming our role 
in the ETP ecosystem in the region.
In general, we believe growth can accelerate in all regions in 
the coming years, as electronic trading continues to evolve 
and we also start to diversify our technology and trading 
knowledge into FX trading. In terms of the ongoing 
discussions surrounding regulation, we continue to 
anticipate changes that further support a level playing field.
Products
ETPs
ETPs, the main products that we trade, are often compared 
to mutual funds mainly because they are both baskets of 
shares, bonds, or commodities. However, that is where the 
similarity ends. Unlike most mutual funds, the majority of 
ETPs simply track an index without trying to beat such 
indices. ETPs have open-ended fund structures rather than 
closed-end and, unlike mutual funds, can be continuously 
bought and sold on trading venues during trading hours and 
off-exchange after trading hours. 
They provide investors with exposure to a wide variety of 
underlying assets, ranging from ETPs that replicate the 
composition of a particular equity index, to those that 
provide investors with exposure to assets in specific sectors 
ETP market remains high growth market
In the ETP market, we see significant opportunities for 
growth, driven by the widely expected expansion of this 
industry in the foreseeable future. This is due to a number of 
changes within the asset management industry, including: 
◾
◾
The continuing shift to global electronic trading, which 
cuts costs and maximizes efficiency and transparency;
◾
◾
A shift in asset growth from active strategies to more 
cost-effective, passive strategies;
◾
◾
Increasing ETP adoption globally among institutions, 
intermediaries and retail investors;
◾
◾
Long-term shifts driven by regulators looking to 
increase financial stability and transparency, such as 
MiFID II.
To take advantage of this expected growth, we aim to 
expand our presence further in all areas of ETP trading in all 
regions.
In Europe we continue to grow our presence on the different 
venues and grow the number of counterparties. To date we 
have established a connection with virtually all issuers active 
in Europe and we continued to grow our institutional 
counterparty-base substantially. MiFID II developments are 
showing a beneficial impact on our counterparty base 
already, as investors increase their focus on best execution, 
regardless of research access.
In the Americas, where our current market share has grown 
substantially in 2017, but is still relatively limited. We believe 
there is significant growth potential in fixed income ETFs, 
developed market equity ETFs and institutional trading. 
Institutional trading has gained mass in 2017 and is expected 
to grow further in 2018. We will continue to expand the 
number of products traded, the number of venues in the US 
and the number of counterparties we are connected to.
Global coverage
We trade globally from four offices, in New York, 
Amsterdam, Singapore and Hong Kong. The largest ETP 
market is still in the United States, where total ETP value 
traded (on-exchange and off-exchange) was €15.72 trillion 
in 2017. Our New York office’s total ETP value traded was 
€245 billion in 2017, an improvement versus 2016 and the 
highest level for Flow Traders US since inception. 
With institutional trading gaining momentum in 2017, Flow 
Traders US continued to grow its overall presence in 2017. 
The EMEA ETP market, the world’s second largest, had 
a total ETP value traded of €851 billion in 2017. Our total ETP 
value traded from our Europe office was €418 billion in 2017. 
We remained the number one liquidity provider in ETFs in 
EMEA and managed to grow our on- and off exchange 
presence further.
In APAC, the ETP market is still fragmented, with large 
differences in trading volumes, trading costs, regulation and 
maturity across the financial markets. Additionally, the 
volumes traded in the APAC region are dominated by the 
top-10 most traded ETF products, as those 10 determine 
roughly 60-65 percent of the total market volumes. While 
that is a lower percentage than in 2016, it is nevertheless still 
very large. The total ETP value traded (on-exchange and 
off-exchange) was €1.9 trillion in 2017, including China, while 
the total ETP value traded at our Singapore office was €23 
billion. Overall we grew our market share further to about 
4 percent globally. That is the highest level we have ever 
realized since inception of our company.

or countries, to commodities, or to currencies. ETPs also 
enable investors to create and manage diversified 
investment portfolios in an efficient manner, as well as 
enabling them to switch exposures at any given moment 
during trading days. There are broadly three main categories 
within ETPs in which we trade: 
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
This category is the most traded, when compared to ETCs 
and ETNs. ETFs derive their value from shares or bonds held 
in proportion to an index. For example, a Euro Stoxx 50 ETF 
would hold the same shares as the Euro Stoxx 50 index, in 
approximately the same proportions. Fixed-income ETFs 
derive their value from a portfolio of debt instruments. 
For example, bonds included in the Barclays US Treasury 1-3 
Year Term Index. ETFs are the most widespread among ETPs 
as measured by AuM.
Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs)
ETCs typically derive their value from a commodity index, 
such as the Bloomberg Commodity Index, although in some 
cases they derive it from just a single commodity, such as 
gold or oil, or a certain currency. For example, the SPDR 
Gold Shares ETC tracks the value of physical gold. ETCs may 
hold physical assets, but exposure can also be held through 
derivatives of the underlying commodity, in combination 
with cash.
Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)
ETNs are a type of unsecured, unsubordinated debt security 
issued by an underwriting bank. The returns of ETNs are 
based on the performance of the index being tracked. 
For example, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures 
Index TR ETN would track the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term 
Futures volatility index.

The ETP ecosystem
The ETP ecosystem is made up of a number of participants who together make ETP investing and trading possible. These include: 
investors, ETP issuers, exchanges and other trading venues and authorized participants, who can also act as liquidity providers, 
such as Flow Traders. The ETP ecosystem can be further divided into two markets: the primary market and the secondary market.

Pricing
Pricing ETPs accurately 
Being able to accurately price the ETPs that we provide 
liquidity in is vital to the success of our business. Get it 
wrong, and we lose money or a trade goes to a competitor. 
Our experience in establishing the pricing relationship 
between the ETPs and the underlying assets in a variety of 
market conditions means we can offer competitive bid and 
ask prices, while still covering our trading costs and locking 
in transaction profit. We achieve this using pre-set hedging 
strategies, which (where possible) instantly reduce our 
market exposure, creating a market-neutral position. And it 
is these hedging strategies that enable us to trade ETPs in 
such a way that our Net Trading Income is unaffected by any 
price movements of the underlying or related securities. 
liquidity we make it easier for investors to buy and sell ETPs 
at a price that should reflect the (relation with the) current 
price of the underlying asset, and contribute to lower trading 
costs.
 
Another role we play in the ETP landscape is as an 
authorized participant (AP). We have AP-agreements in 
place with all the major ETP issuers. These agreements link 
the primary and the secondary ETP market and allow us to 
either create or redeem the ETPs and optimize our role as 
a leading liquidity provider in ETPs.
Liquidity Provider
Leading liquidity provider
We are recognized by the ETP industry as a leader in ETP 
liquidity provision. Each year for the last ten years we have 
won the ‘ETF Market Maker Europe’ award in the Global ETF 
Awards. We received the equivalent distinction in APAC as 
‘ETF Market Maker Asia-Pacific’ in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 
2016. Flow Traders has also been voted ‘Best Trading House 
for ETFs in the ETF Risk European Rankings’ in three 
consecutive years: 2013, 2014 and 2015. Finally, ETF Express 
awarded Flow Traders with the title ‘Best Asia-Pacific Market 
Maker’ in 2013 and 2016 and ‘Best European ETF Market 
Maker’ for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. We consistently rank in 
the top-three in terms of market share of ETP value traded 
on Europe’s five largest ETP trading venues: Deutsche Börse, 
Borsa Italiana, Euronext, Swiss Exchange (SIX) and LSE. 
In terms of total on-exchange ETP value traded in Europe, 
we hold a leading position.
Primary market
Interaction in the primary market takes place between 
authorized participants (APs) and the issuers, who either 
issue or cancel ETPs. This is done in reaction to market 
demand and is called the creation and redemption process. 
Authorized participants can create ETPs with the issuer by 
transferring the underlying assets (or cash equivalent) to the 
issuer in return for a corresponding number of newly issued 
ETPs. This increases the ETP’s AuM. In this way, the issuance 
of ETPs through authorized participants provides the issuers 
with access to a broad investor market without having to 
support a complex and costly trading infrastructure which 
would be non-core to their business. Redemption is the 
reverse of the creation process: the authorized participant 
transfers ETPs to their issuer in exchange for the underlying 
assets (or a cash equivalent). The issuer then cancels the 
ETPs it received. This decreases the ETP’s AuM. 
Secondary market
The secondary market is where ETP trading takes place 
between market participants, similar to the trading of 
ordinary shares, at market-determined prices. Secondary 
market participants include institutional and retail investors, 
liquidity providers and authorized participants. Secondary 
markets include exchanges and other automated trading 
venues, as well as off-exchange trading between market 
participants such as large institutional investors.
The role of Flow Traders
We have two main roles in the ETP ecosystem. The first is as 
a liquidity provider. In this role, we help maintain and 
improve the overall transparency and efficiency of the 
ecosystem, by quoting bid and ask prices for ETPs on trading 
venues, as well as off-exchange to institutional investors, 
that market participants can trade against. By providing

Cutting edge proprietary technology 
platform
We are a financial technology company. As such, technology 
lies at the heart of the business, enabling us to provide 
liquidity in a variety of market environments across the 
globe. We trade using proprietary and scalable software 
with the vast majority of our applications developed 
in-house. These include pricing and trading software, market 
data processing tools, pre-trade risk controls, and other risk 
and compliance tools. This is the main reason that our 
Technology department makes up around one-third of our 
total staff.
One of our software platform’s core features is its modular 
design, which allows us to rapidly test and implement 
ongoing enhancements. This also means we can easily and 
cost-effectively expand our coverage of securities, asset 
classes, and geographical markets as we grow the business.
In 2017 our total technology expenses grew 7 percent to 
support the improvements in our infrastructure and the 
growth in the number of trading venues. In total our 2017 
technology expenses were 44 percent of the total fixed 
expenses. Including salaries this would be 55 percent, which 
highlights our focus on technology as part of our business 
model. The number of technology FTEs grew from 118 to 
143, also confirming our overall growth.
Real-time risk management 
We manage risk effectively across the company. Within the 
trading environment we reduce our risk by monitoring our 
trades and positions, market exposure, portfolio efficiency, 
and liquidity on a real-time basis. Our risk management 
system is fully integrated with our trading platform, 
analyzing pricing data and ensuring that our order activity is 
conducted within pre-determined trading and position limits 
independently. At the same time the system reconciles 
internal transaction records against those of our prime 
brokers and exchanges where possible. Off-exchange we 
use strict risk management approval and monitoring 
procedures for institutional trading counterparties. 
Additionally, we settle almost all of our off-exchange trades 
through delivery-versus-payment, which means that the 
delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment 
by the buyer, thus limiting counterparty risk. For more 
information, please refer to the Our Risk Management 
chapter.

Growth focus
We focus on incremental growth. Although we will not 
exclude any possibilities where it concerns M&A activity, any 
opportunity would have to outweigh the integration costs 
and cultural issues that could potentially arise.
Strategy
Our strategic ambition
Our ambition is to be the leading global electronic liquidity 
provider. 
Our market
We operate in a highly competitive market that is changing 
rapidly. It is characterized by heightened regulation and an 
ever-increasing focus on technology. Yet the market’s core 
function remains the same: transferring risk between 
market participants. This is where we add value. Our focus 
will continue to be on providing liquidity in the fast growing 
ETPs market, and we are striving to trade all ETPs. 
Our business principles
Our business principles are being flexible, agile and being 
focused on continuous improvements. To be successful, we 
recognize that we need to perform well across all areas of 
the business. Achieving this involves diligently studying the 
markets and our responses to them, and using our resources 
where they have the greatest impact. The outcome of this 
process defines whether or not we have a competitive edge.
Our strategy 
We will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing to grow 
our business incrementally. This should result in increasing 
our Net Trading Income, while maintaining our desired risk 
profile, controlling costs, and securing and attracting the 
right talent. Increasing our NTI involves increasing the 
product of volume and revenue capture, where volume is 
the value of products we trade and revenue capture is the 
net margin we capture per trade after the corresponding 
exposure has been hedged. Our risk profile is characterized 
by having no opinion on market movement or direction.

firms dealing on their own account. Starting 31 March 2018 
Flow Traders is required to meet the regulatory requirement 
of the EU Capital Requirement Regulation (CRR). After 
detailed assessment Flow Traders has implemented the 
requirements applicable and expects to comply with these 
Capital Requirements as from 31 March 2018 onwards.
Growth
Flow Traders continued to grow its team, strategies and 
infrastructure in 2017. We increased our institutional 
counterparties globally to over 700, increased the number 
of products in which we provide liquidity to around 5,500 
and increased the number of venues to which we are 
connected to, to over 100. To facilitate this growth, we 
continued to grow the business during the year across all 
regions, resulting in an increase in the number of FTEs to 394 
by year-end (2016: 341).
traded in the market. VIX touched levels below 10 and set 
lows not recorded since 1990. 
Operational expenses
Our fixed operational expenses developed in line with 
guidance of 15-20 percent in 2017. We continued to invest in 
our people and technology to ensure future growth. Due to 
the strong focus on our cost growth, we were able to 
maintain an EBITDA margin of 34 percent in 2017 (2016: 47.5 
percent). Going forward our costs expect to grow at 
a maximum rate of 15 percent annually. 
Capital base
During the year we continued to maintain a strong, stable 
capital base, comfortably exceeding our regulatory and 
prime broker capital requirements. We paid out a €0.30 
interim dividend in August 2017 and propose to pay €0.35 as 
a final dividend. Over the course of 2017 we returned a total 
of €0.65 through dividends to our shareholders, as we raised 
the payout ratio to at least 75 percent in the third quarter 
of 2017.

Financial overview
Net Trading Income
The 2017 macro-economic topics surrounding the United 
States’ domestic politics and foreign affairs, as well as the 
ECB developments, pushed trading activity down further 
and kept flows in the markets centered around liquid 
products in the absence of the need to diversify investment 
strategies. The spreads in the market are impacted by the 
low volatility (characterized by VIX) which was showing 
levels not seen in a long time. These developments affected 
our Net Trading Income, which decreased to €166 million 
(2016: €250 million), although our ETP value traded 
increased to €686 billion (2016: €640 billion). This shows the 
market conditions Flow Traders operated in in 2017, as our 
revenue capture was impacted by the shift to highly liquid 
products and a prolonged period of low volatility in the 
market globally. Compared to 2016, our consolidated 
revenue capture decreased to 2.4 bps (2016:3.9 bps).
Market volatility
In 2017 market volatility declined sharply to record lows. 
Unlike previous years, 2017 had very few moments of 
heightened market volatility or pickups noted in volumes

Our success is driven by a combination of smart 
trading strategies, state-of-the-art proprietary 
technology and prudent risk management. 
Our people are critical to being able to deliver on 
these items, which is why we aim to recruit and 
retain the best talent available.
Culture
Open, informal and diverse culture
Our work environment is a reflection of the things we 
believe in. We believe that it is more important how you 
perform than what you wear. So our employees dress 
comfortably for work – jeans, t-shirts and sneakers are 
common. We believe that what someone says is more 
important than who says it. We believe that the 
contributions of our team-members are crucial to the 
success of the company. We believe that two people know 
more than one, and that people can have great ideas even in 
areas different to their core expertise. Therefore, we 
welcome and encourage everyone to share their opinions. 
Anyone with a good idea, be it in his/her own area of 
expertise or another, will be encouraged to put this forward. 
This is part of our open and collaborative culture.
One of our core values is ownership, and we mean it both in 
terms of mindset and behavior as well as literally. We believe 
that being a shareholder aligns the interests of the company 
with those of our employees. To promote shareholding and 
reward loyalty we have commenced awarding company 
shares to employees marking their two-year anniversary. 
Our employees include people from different backgrounds 
and nationalities. We have economists, engineers, computer 
scientists, mathematicians, lawyers and physicists among 
our employees. We harbor people from 43 different 
nationalities (2016: 36). This diversity ensures different 
viewpoints are brought into discussions, and we believe this 
leads to better, more innovative outcomes for the company.

Attract Talent
How we recruit
Our offices are all growing, and we look to hire as many 
qualified applicants as we can find. However, our selection 
standards remain high – our candidates need to go through 
a number of tests and interviews, with less than 1 percent of 
applicants for Trading positions ultimately receiving a job 
offer. To find people with the unique skill sets needed for 
a global liquidity provider we recruit across the globe, 
advertising and searching across multiple platforms. 
We also visit campuses in India, Hong Kong, Australia, 
Singapore, the US, and across Europe, meeting talents in 
career fairs and workshops. We recruit for all disciplines and 
look for the best caliber available, regardless of their gender, 
age, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. 
Junior traders are typically recruited straight from university. 
Although our traders have a varied educational background, 
they share a strong numerical aptitude, which is why 
a numerical test is an important part of the selection 
procedure. To experience the world of trading first hand, we 
invite a selected group of students to our bi-annual Business 
Course in our Amsterdam office. The two-day event is 
packed with interesting and challenging trading exercises 
and simulations and includes quantitative and technical 
cases to mirror the evolving nature of the role. We also host 
numerous informal events such as the annual poker 
tournaments in Amsterdam and New York, and trading 
competitions in select universities in Canada, the US, 
Australia and Singapore.
Candidates for roles other than trading are qualified 
specialists who have relevant work experience. We make 
very little use of contractors or temporary employees.
In 2017 we continued hosting, participating in, and 
sponsoring a variety of events, ranging from in-house days, 
Java User Group Meet ups, WomenHack ‘speed dating’ and 
Meeting C++ in Berlin.
We sponsored the IT Cluj Days, one of the biggest IT related 
fairs in Cluj Napoca with over 800 registered participants. 
A highlight of the event was our Co-CEO, Sjoerd Rietberg, 
giving a presentation on “What It Takes to Be a Leading 
Liquidity Provider in Today’s Financial Markets”.
Engage and Invest
Our Offices
All our offices are designed to provide a pleasant and 
ergonomically sound place to work. They are flooded with 
light, have attractive, well laid out interiors and 
ergonomically-optimized furniture. In addition, to give our 
people the opportunity to perform at their best, we offer 
healthy breakfast and lunch options, have our own in-house 
gym facilities and bar in Amsterdam, Singapore, Hong Kong 
and New York, and organize great company trips and parties. 
We not only use our newly-designed bars for after work 
gatherings, but also for recruiting events and quarterly staff 
updates. The bars’ authentic feel and design, which 
contrasts with the sleek, modern, white-and-red interior of 
our offices, has been well received by visitors. We believe 
these benefits are important to maintain a healthy and 
happy workforce and to stimulate bonding and connections 
beyond employees’ direct circle of colleagues, helping to 
stimulate teamwork across the whole company.
Onboarding
We are a fast growing company. In 2017 we had over 100 new 
hires, a 16 percent increase in the number of employees 
versus 2016. Our new colleagues join us from all parts of the 
world. To make sure they feel at home quickly we offer full 
relocation support for everyone moving to our offices from 
abroad. We help with finding a home, applying for a visa and 
getting to know the local culture. We also offer all 
international employees the opportunity to attend Dutch 
language classes.
Our new hires in trading and technology start with an 
intensive introduction program, bringing them up to speed 
with our way of working and training them in the specific 
skills they need to do their job well. All junior traders – 
including those hired in Asia and the US – begin their global 
training program at our offices in Amsterdam. In 2017 we 
also introduced a general onboarding program for all new 
hires in support functions, which provides a complete 
overview of our business.

profitability of the company, which means we only award 
variable remuneration, or pay deferred remuneration, if 
there is sufficient profit and capital to do so. 
In 2017, company-wide average compensation paid per 
employee was approximately €145,520 while variable 
remuneration amounted to around 44 percent of total 
compensation in 2017. In 2017 no employees (including the 
Management Board) were awarded remuneration of 
€1 million or more (2016: 19). 
Training and rotation
We help our employees shape their own future. We offer 
everyone diverse training opportunities, aimed at improving 
function-specific skills or for their own personal 
development. To facilitate continuous learning, we launched 
an exciting new platform in 2017, Flow Academy, with 
courses spanning all areas of the business and delivered 
through a variety of interactive formats. The offerings will 
continue to evolve and expand, helping our people develop 
even further. 
Most of our managers are ‘home-grown’, having developed 
into their positions after a number of years working with the 
company. They set an example and act as an inspiration for 
new hires, illustrating the career paths open to them. 
To further support them in their personal growth, 
a leadership development program will be introduced in 
2018.
To complement self-growth, we also like to give our 
employees the chance to transfer between our offices and 
experience life and work elsewhere. 
Remuneration
We reward our uniquely skilled employees with an attractive 
combination of fixed and variable pay. When awarding 
variable compensation, we look beyond an employee’s 
individual results or direct area of responsibility. The variable 
pay element depends on company performance, individual 
performance, and how an employee contributed to the 
long-term success of the company as a whole. We use this 
compensation structure as an important tool to stimulate 
team work and risk awareness and to reward performance. 
For example, awarding variable remuneration and payment 
of deferred variable remuneration depends on the future

Sustainability statement
Our activities influence the society we live in. As a liquidity 
provider we are active on global financial markets and we 
contribute to transparency and to the pricing process, 
enabling market participants to invest at fair prices and lower 
costs. Our activities contribute to sustainable employment 
and technological innovation in our society and we are 
committed to full compliance and integrity. We seek to limit 
our environmental footprint and contribute to our society and 
immediate vicinity. 
Our activities do not involve the production, use, processing 
or transport of physical goods. We therefore have not 
explicitly incorporated sustainable development goals into 
the company’s strategy. However, sustainable business and 
value creation is of high importance to Flow Traders. We aim 
to reach a sustainable environment by means of –amongst 
others – our environmental footprint, societal commitment 
and commitment to charity and our Equal Opportunity 
Policy.
We are aware of our impact on society while executing our 
business strategy. Four themes summarize our interaction 
with society: 
1	
We offer liquidity to financial markets;
2	
We offer sustainable employment;
3	
We are committed to full compliance and integrity;
4	
We are involved in society and our immediate vicinity.
1.	 We offer liquidity on financial markets
We contribute to transparency and effective operation of 
global financial markets by providing liquidity to markets 
globally. We facilitate that thousands of exchange-traded 
products (ETPs) and similar products can be traded across 
the world’s markets, by continuously quoting bid and ask 
prices. As an innovative segment of global financial markets, 
ETPs have introduced efficiencies and cut investment costs 
substantially for a wide range of investors, from pension 
funds to retail investors. Increased liquidity, higher 
execution quality, and lower overall trading costs are just 
some of the benefits that liquidity providers, such as Flow 
Traders, offer through these innovative financial products 
compared to more traditional investment products. 
Our role is to enable trading in widely diversified investment 
products accessible and transparent to anyone at any time, 
allowing end investors to invest with lower costs and thus 
potentially higher returns. As a result, over the years, trading 
costs have dropped dramatically and access to transparent 
and inexpensive investment products for anyone, and not 
only the happy few, has never been more efficient. 
This benefits institutional investors, individual investors and, 
ultimately, society at large.
Stakeholder dialogue
We enter the public dialogue with full transparency. 
Our contributions to the regulatory dialogue are typically 
made public and we are always willing to discuss what we do, 
and how that impacts the world around us. We have 
extensive dialogues with interest groups, including those 
focusing on transparency, institutional and retail 
shareholder interests, academia and students, local 
governments, regulators and anyone else who has an 
interest in what we do, and how we do it. We commit to being 
approachable and fully transparent with the goal to promote 
fairness, transparency and orderly functioning of the 
financial markets.

Employee dialogue
We take good care of our people and stakeholders. 
We ensure a high-quality working environment, fair 
treatment and equal remuneration principles for all our 
staff, including contractors, regardless of gender, tenure or 
personal factors. All employees and contractors have 
unrestricted, direct access to senior management and are 
regularly informed and consulted about key developments. 
People are encouraged to speak their minds to help make 
Flow Traders better. Information travels freely and is not 
restricted unless we need to protect overriding interests, 
such as those concerning regulations, commercial 
sensitivities or to protect our intellectual property. 
In addition, we hold regular employee surveys, including 
that held by ‘Great Place to Work’, to hear our employees’ 
views on how the company is doing and their experiences 
about their day-to-day workplace.
3.	 We are committed to full compliance 
and integrity
Flow Traders is a strong proponent of effective, efficient and 
equal regulation and contributes to the regulatory dialogue 
in our key jurisdictions as we want markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
We commit to complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations that apply to us, wherever we operate, including 
in respect of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Integrity 
and transparency is central to the way we run our business, 
from our Management Board and Supervisory Board to all 
our staff, regardless of their role. The company encourages 
an open culture within its organization and expects its 
employees to comply with applicable laws, regulations and 
internal policies. Each employee is responsible for 
we have drafted an Equal Opportunity Policy. Please refer to 
the chapter Our Governance for further information. 
Remuneration
We believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and office are 
entitled to receive a variable compensation relative to their 
contribution to the firm as a whole. We are transparent 
about how we pay our people and how much we pay them, 
including management. We have a straight-forward 
remuneration policy that permits variable pay only when 
a profit is made. And because variable remuneration is, to 
a large extent, deferred, it remains at risk of forfeiture in the 
case that we sustain a loss. We believe this is the strongest 
incentive for sustainable, risk-aware behavior for all our 
staff. In addition, we promote employee shareholding, 
particularly at more senior levels. This aligns the interests of 
the company with those of our employees by creating ‘skin 
in the game’. Please refer to the sections Our People and 
Remuneration for more information.
Education
We provide our people with a range of excellent training 
programs, benefitting them and the company. New hires 
within the Trading and Technology departments follow 
rigorous initial training, while in 2017 all our employees 
received an introduction to Flow Academy. This is an online 
training resource that provides programs in a wide variety of 
subjects, including culture, technology, regulatory 
developments and trading for non-traders. For additional 
information, please refer to the section Our People.
2.	 We offer sustainable employment
By creating and maintaining high-quality jobs we help 
develop a stable and trusting working environment that 
benefits our people, our business, and society. Since we 
started in 2004, our goal has been to foster a culture that 
encourages innovation, entrepreneurialism and 
risk-awareness, while focusing on drive, teamwork and 
ownership. Developing talent in-house and maintaining 
a committed and substantial employee shareholder base 
strengthens internal bonds and helps create a loyal, 
forward-looking team. We invest in employees for the long 
run. We encourage our people to move between offices 
internationally, to share ideas and best practices across the 
company, while experiencing life in different cultures. 
Although our business does not directly affect human rights 
issues, we are strong proponents of ensuring fair and equal 
treatment for all and expect the same from our employees, 
relationships and stakeholders.
Diversity
We believe that a diverse workforce helps create a richer 
variety of ideas and provides better solutions to the 
challenges we face. We have a long-standing policy of 
recruiting and retaining the best talent available, regardless 
of their gender, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. We are 
committed to providing equal employment opportunities to 
all qualified job applicants. As a result, we employ people 
from 43 nationalities across our offices. The composition of 
our workforce tracks the outflow of the education system in 
the various roles we offer at Flow Traders. We strongly 
encourage women to apply for any function within the firm, 
particularly when they have a background in fields that 
traditionally have a higher proportion of male employees. 
In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code,

Employees are free to raise issues and have the 
responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, or any 
reasonable suspicions. 
Circumstances may arise that cause an employee to feel 
insecure or unsafe to the extent that they may not want to 
use the usual reporting lines. The company provides 
employees with a safe way of reporting misconduct within 
its organization and offers adequate protection. 
The Whistle-blower Policy has wide applications, including in 
respect of topics such as fraud, market abuse, corruption, 
anti-money laundering, theft, bribery and any other 
structural misconduct that threatens the integrity and 
proper business conduct of Flow Traders. The Whistle-
blower Policy provides whistle-blowers with anonymity, 
confidentiality, and the company will not impose sanctions 
on disclosure (or affect an employee’s position) unless the 
employee is involved in the issue that is being reported. 
Our Whistle-blower Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
Fair taxation
We are committed to being good corporate citizens of the 
communities we operate in. We pay taxes where they are 
due and subscribe to fair taxation, both in terms of 
corporate taxes and wage taxation. In 2017 we paid total 
taxes of €54.2 million which was 33 percent of our Net 
Trading Income.
As set out in the Our Governance chapter, Flow Traders 
operates a fair, transparent and straightforward tax policy. 
We believe this is an important part of being a sustainable 
business and in delivering long-term value to all of the 
company’s stakeholders, including the tax authorities in 
countries whose infrastructure and facilities we benefit 
conducting business ethically and honestly. We have issued 
a Code of Conduct which forms part of our employment 
documentation. This Code of Conduct can be found on our 
website www.flowtraders.com.
Anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
We have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering (AML) policies in place that apply to all our staff. 
We expect our counterparties, business partners, 
intermediaries, contractors and subcontractors to adhere to 
the same standards. We believe that the risk of bribery or 
corruption is very limited as we do not hold or manage client 
money or funds. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain production 
facilities or source raw materials. Nevertheless, staff receive 
training in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and AML practices.
Key to our Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption Policy is that 
officials or counterparties may never be placed in an 
uncomfortable position. No gifts nor favors may lead (or 
have the appearance to lead) to obligations or embarrass 
any recipient, and no gifts nor favors of any substantial 
value may be given to authorities. Facilitation payments are 
not permitted. We provide clear and recurring guidance in 
that respect. As part of our constant monitoring, all 
expenses and gifts relating to external parties are checked 
by senior managers and employees have to state what the 
purpose of an expense was and who was the recipient.
Whistle-blowers
On top of our very strong culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have an elaborate Whistle-blower 
Policy in place for all staff and relevant contractors, 
approved by the Management Board and Supervisory Board.

appropriate actions to adopt these initiatives in its tax 
control framework. Further details on our tax policy can be 
found under Tax Principles on our website, which also serve 
as KPIs throughout the entire company’s performance 
measurement. The tax function within the company will 
therefore provide appropriate input as part of the approval 
process for business proposals to ensure a clear 
understanding of the tax consequences. We have good 
standing relationships with the tax authorities in each region 
in which we operate. We pro-actively manage our 
relationship with the tax authorities with the aim of 
minimizing the risk of challenge, dispute or damage that 
could have an impact on our credibility. We concluded 
a horizontal supervision agreement with the Dutch tax 
authorities (horizontaal toezicht) with a view to further 
strengthening our transparent and professional relationship 
with the tax authorities. Tax laws, rules and interpretations 
long-term value to all our stakeholders. The dialogue we 
have with stakeholders includes discussions on the 
company’s financial reporting and tax policy and, as with all 
stakeholder input, is considered during our decision making 
process, but so far has not lead in a desire from the 
stakeholders to change our tax policy. The open dialogue 
towards our financial reporting and tax policy has not 
resulted in any material requests to change our reporting or 
tax policy. For every business decision, tax aspects are 
presented and weighed as part of the decision making 
process. The commercial needs will in no circumstances 
override compliance with (tax) laws and strives to be 
compliant with the spirit of the law. The company supports 
transparency initiatives such as the country-by-country 
reporting and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting from the 
OECD and assesses frequently the impact of such initiatives. 
Where necessary or relevant, Flow Traders take the 
from. We do not use aggressive tax structuring or tax 
havens. We entered into a covenant with the Dutch Tax 
Authority for horizontal supervision (horizontaal toezicht). 
This allows the Dutch Tax Authority and ourselves to 
pro-actively manage our relationship and discuss any tax 
items in a timely, transparent and professional manner.
Principles of financial reporting and tax policy
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of its 
financial reporting and its relations with tax authorities 
globally. With regard to financial reporting, conservative 
accounting principles are being applied and one-offs must 
occur infrequently and be clearly documented. 
As aforementioned, Flow Traders operates a fair, transparent 
and straightforward tax policy, which we believe is important 
when running a sustainable business and delivering

provide presents to their children during the festive season 
and a large number of employees donated money or toys to 
support this initiative. Additionally, we sponsored the 
‘NewTechKids’ project, which is designed to provide 
computer science classes to children ranging from ages 7  
to 12.
Our employees also take part in sports events to raise 
awareness and donations for a range of different charities. 
At the beginning of 2017 a group of eight employees climbed 
Kilimanjaro to raise money for the charity War Child.
Dilemmas
In our daily activities we sometimes encounter dilemmas 
where we weigh our societal impact against business benefits. 
Being a listed company, we mostly find them in the 
intersection of regulations and entrepreneurship. Apart from 
having internal rules and regulations such as the Code of 
Conduct and the Whistle-blower Policy, we try to assess and 
resolve these dilemmas by applying common sense and 
remaining aware of our role within society.
For example: while we seek profit by trading in a highly 
competitive environment, we feel that we must leverage our 
knowledge and our position as a market participant to 
safeguard fair, orderly and transparent markets for others. 
More specifically, we see purpose in protecting retail investor 
interests in these markets. Therefore, we spend considerable 
resources and efforts to address such outside interests in our 
regulatory dialogue as it improves market quality for 
everyone, including more vulnerable participants.
4.	 We are involved in society and our 
immediate vicinity
Environmental footprint
Many of our employees live reasonably close to our offices, 
limiting travel. We seek to limit our energy use and CO2 
emissions to take care of our environment. 
When refurbishing our offices we sought to use more 
environmentally friendly solutions for lighting and water 
consumption. We regularly review opportunities to 
compensate or limit our footprint, for instance by applying 
greener alternatives and carrying out annual energy audits 
in order to assess and reduce our impact on our 
environment.
Societal commitment and charity
It is important for us to back initiatives that contribute to 
society. We support a number of charities, not only 
financially but also by offering access to the knowledge and 
experience that we have available. Our people feel 
empowered to support charitable initiatives, which has 
always been part of our working culture. We engage in 
community giving throughout the year, and across our 
offices. We do this by supporting our people in fundraising 
activities by giving time or access to our network, by 
providing guidance to help them have as great an impact as 
possible, and by contributing financially. At the end of 2017 
we asked each employee to donate €250 to a charity of their 
choice. As a result, more than 100 charitable organizations 
received donations.
Individual employees have also initiated backing of 
a growing number of charities, with the support of the 
company and their colleagues. For example, one of our 
employees collects toys for parents who are unable to 
are continuously subject to a changing social view towards 
tax and we cannot be certain of continued benefit from 
certain tax regimes, such as the FSI Schemes in Singapore 
and innovation box regime in the Netherlands. The key 
participants in the Tax Control Framework are well 
established and include the Supervisory Board, Managing 
Board, Finance & Tax department, internal auditors and 
external auditors. They are able to assess and weigh the 
risks associated with the tax decision process for our 
business and stakeholders. 
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local tax legislation. We do not use tax 
haven jurisdictions for tax avoidance purposes and carry out 
our business through entities in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the company can operate its business in 
line with its belief that it is part of the corporate social 
responsibility duty to pay taxes where it operates. In addition 
to corporate income taxes, Flow Traders pays many other 
taxes, including payroll taxes and social security 
contributions on the wages of its employees, value added 
taxes, property taxes. All these taxes are a significant basis 
of funding governmental public services. Flow Traders sees 
it as its responsibility to contribute to this. For more 
information on our tax position, please refer to note 12 of 
the financial statements.

Flow Traders’ Risk Management Framework 
(RMF) forms the foundation of our approach to 
managing key risks. 
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, 
quantify and document possible risks which are 
inherent to trading in an automated environment. 
In this very dynamic world of automated trading, 
we have designed our RMF in such a way that it is 
robust, efficient and transparent. The RMF helps 
ensure that we have sufficient internal control 
and internal capital through a consistent, 
continuous and careful method for addressing, 
managing and prioritising key risks in the context 
of our enterprise-wide strategic objectives.
Enterprise Risk Management
We aim for a good balance between our business activities, 
risk and return. Our risk management is based on the COSO 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, which 
ensures that the risk appetite and profile are integrated into 
the day-to-day operations and the strategic, tactical and 
operational objective setting and decision making.
Effective ERM practices, such as the COSO framework, 
requires that the key components (control environment, risk 
assessment, control activities, information and 
communication and monitoring activities) operate in an 
integrated manner with the strategic, operational, reporting 
and compliance objectives across all company levels.
We incorporate these principles by implementing the 
following ERM Cycle. 
Every year our Management Board sets its business targets 
following the strategic goals (1). Based on the target and 
objectives, the Management Board formulates its risk 
appetite (2). The targets, objectives and risk appetite give 
direction to the various departments within the company 
and are used to derive our strategic risks.

Risk category
Context
STRATEGIC RISKS
Business and Strategic 
risk
This concerns risk related to Flow Traders’ strategy, business model and market conditions. Volatility risk 
is part of this risk as our Net Trading Income and profitability are primarily a function of the level of 
trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial instruments in which we trade.
Compliance and 
regulatory risk
Compliance risk is the threat posed to a company’s earnings or capital as a result of violation or 
non-conformance with laws, regulations, or prescribed practices. It also concerns the risk of changing 
regulatory rules (regulatory risk).
In addition it includes the risk that the integrity of the organisation or its operations is jeopardised as a 
result of unethical behaviour of the organisation, its staff members or management.
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or 
products. Concentration risk also includes supplier dependency risks.
Legal risk
The legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from a claim, failure to adhere to legally binding agreements 
and requirements, or failure to adequately protect assets of the firm or a change in law and regulations 
laws and regulations.
Reputation risk
The reputation risk is the risk of loss resulting from negative exposure to stakeholders. 
OPERATIONAL RISKS
IT risk
The IT risk concerns the risk of loss resulting from inadequate information technology and processing in 
terms of availability, manageability, integrity, controllability and continuity, insufficient protection, or 
inadequate IT strategy and policy or inadequate use.
IT Security risk
This concerns risks relating to access management and data integrity risks.
Operational risk
The operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people 
or from external events. The main driver of operational risk is human error.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that there is not sufficient trading capital or regulatory capital available. This risk 
can be managed by intra-day monitoring of credit lines from the prime brokers, cash, portfolio 
efficiency and liquidity. Furthermore, liquidity risk can arise from having illiquid products on the book 
which cannot be turned in a short timeframe into liquid assets like cash. This part of liquidity risk can be 
mitigated by procedures that only allow trading liquid products and by monitoring the liquidity of the 
book.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market prices; in particular, changes 
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. Market risk could be suffered 
in the event of a firm trading on its own account and the portfolio suffering a devaluation due to 
changing market circumstances or developments. This risk can be mitigated by hedging the market 
exposures and making the portfolio less reactive on market movements. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in trading in or issuing a financial 
instrument defaulting on an obligation, and thus harming the company’s financial position. 
We implement our Risk Management cycle (3) to ensure that 
the residual risk profile is (and remains) in line with the set 
risk appetite. To achieve this, we perform risk (self) 
assessments (RSA) to identify and assess current and newly 
arisen risks and compliance with applicable requirements. 
Following the RSAs, local department heads, global heads in 
cooperation with the Management Board, then decide on 
the appropriate risk response. The effects of the chosen risk 
responses are monitored and periodically the actual residual 
risk profile is mapped versus the appetite.
Risk categories
Flow Traders identifies three general risk categories 
(Strategic risks, Operational risks and Financial risks), each 
with their own specific risks areas:

Risk reporting
We have a standing risk committee that continuously 
assesses the risks we face in our business, comprised of our 
Global Head of Risk and Mid-Office and Management Board. 
Aside from ongoing ad-hoc communication, there is 
a recurring meeting set up in which they discuss all risk 
assessments and risk proposals related to position limits, 
strategies, procedures, capital requirements and other 
requirements of prime brokers and market developments. 
Any major changes to our risk systems, strategies and limit 
setting must subsequently be approved by the Management 
Board. In 2017, there have not been any major failings in the 
internal risk management and control systems observed 
during 2017.Additionally, improvements to the systems are 
discussed with the Management Board.
Besides the standing risk committee, the company has a Risk 
Committee of the Supervisory Board. All members of the 
Supervisory Board are members of this Risk Committee. 
The Management Board informs the Risk Committee of the 
Supervisory Board about the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems. This includes the 
reasonable assurance that the aforementioned systems do 
not contain any material inaccuracies. In addition, the tasks 
of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board includes 
supervision and monitoring, as well as advising the 
Management Board on the operation of the company’s 
internal risk management and control systems. The Risk 
Committee is also responsible for providing advice to the 
Management Board on the company’s development, 
performance, and sustainability of its trading strategies. 
It maintains regular contact with the company’s Trading and 
Risk and Mid-Office departments. For more information on 
the responsibilities of our Risk Committee, please see the 
chapter Our Governance.
Following a review of the company’s risk assessment 
processes, the monitoring of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems has been identified as 
a priority and as a joint responsibility of the Supervisory 
Board and all committees. All risks relevant to each of the 
committees of the Supervisory Board are monitored in the 
Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. This means that 
the relevant items set out in best practice provision 1.4.1 of 
the Corporate Governance Code have been discussed by the 
Supervisory Board, as all members of the Supervisory Board 
are members of the Risk Committee. For more information, 
please refer to the Supervisory Board Report.
Key risks
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from unfavorable 
market movements, such as prices, when positions in 
financial instruments are held. The value of a financial 
instrument may fluctuate because of changes in factors 
such as equity prices, currency rates, future dividend 
expectations, interest rates and volatilities. Our hedging 
strategies, in combination with the use of straightforward 
products and continuous monitoring, aim to minimize this 
risk. Our trading philosophy is that we hedge our positions as 
perfectly as possible and therefore we minimalize exposures 
towards market. The Risk and Mid-Office department 
monitors market risk exposure on a continuous basis 
(including intraday). Based on the limits set per product or 
the aggregated risk, limit breaches, if any, will trigger action 
from the Risk team in order to reduce the risk. In addition, 
the trading positions are also monitored daily, and the 
applicable haircuts and margins are computed by our prime 
brokers.
Volatility risk (business risk)
Our Net Trading Income and profitability are primarily 
a function of the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, 
in the financial instruments in which we trade, and the 
bid-ask spreads (which largely determine the profit on the 
trade, or margins, we capture). Trading volumes in securities, 
derivatives and other financial instruments on exchanges 
and in other trading venues worldwide are directly affected 
by factors beyond our control, including economic and 
political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, 
regulatory requirements, actions by central banks, and 
changes in the markets in which such transactions occur.
To cope with periods of little market movement, we diversify 
in products and markets traded. This to ensure we are not

subjected to a review of its code, validation in an 
environment that is separate from our production 
environment, testing in limited production (processing 
a strictly limited number of trades) on one trading desk in 
respect of trading a single financial instrument, followed by 
more extensive testing across multiple desks and/or trading 
multiple financial instruments. Each step, and progressing 
through steps, is documented. 
Flow Traders has a monitoring system in place to control 
undisrupted trading activities in real time. Multilayer 
monitoring is employed to avoid errors, but, when these 
occur the relevant teams are notified via multiple 
notification channels. We rely on multiple third party service 
providers for business and market data. 
Our systems are designed such that they can be monitored 
real-time, as well as being maintained and supported by 
qualified professionals from any office. Our risk 
management system is fully integrated with our trading 
investment in technology is important to mitigate those 
associated risks. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, 
high-performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new hardware 
and software. Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement improvements in 
both hardware and software on an ongoing basis. Controlled 
releases of hardware and software enhancements provide 
for minimal disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or updates 
of our trading software) is being developed is strictly 
separated from the environment in which such trading 
software operates in production. Access to the source code 
is strictly controlled and limited. Prior to releasing our 
trading software, or an update into the production 
environment, any element of our trading software is 
too depending on the levels of market activity in one asset 
class or product category. From our experience we know 
that in these periods some trading desks tend to earn less 
where others show an increase in earnings. Therefore, these 
strategies may serve as a (partial) hedge in such 
circumstances. To control the risk of low market activity, we 
actively manage our costs and aim to keep our fixed costs 
low. In addition, we diversify into different markets and 
products.
Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or 
external events. Operational risk management is an integral 
part of Flow Traders’ management information and control 
systems. As our operational risks are concentrated in 
technology events at exchanges and clearing houses, our

censures, suspension or expulsion from trading venues or 
the revocation or limitation of licenses. We aim to minimize 
such risks by focusing considerable management attention, 
employing highly-qualified compliance and risk 
professionals, deploying training, monitoring and reporting 
systems, and continuously evaluating and implementing 
current and upcoming regulation on our operations. 
Notwithstanding such efforts, given the highly regulated 
nature of our business, we are regularly subject to routine 
(and sometimes more targeted) inquiries and audits from 
regulators and trading venues. It is difficult to predict or 
manage the outcome of such inquiries, although we aim to 
be as transparent and cooperative as possible given the 
circumstances.
We continuously invest in good professional relationships 
with trading venues, regulators and other relevant parties. 
Flow Traders is a founding member of the FIA European 
Principal Traders Association (FIA EPTA), a member of the 
FIA Principal Traders Group (FIA PTG) in the US and 
a member of FIA Asia. These are industry groups that consist 
of leading principal trading firms. We are also a member of 
the Dutch Association of Proprietary Traders (APT), 
operating as an industry body of Netherlands-based 
liquidity providers. As part of these important groups, we 
continue to promote, foremost, the principle that all 
markets and market participants should be adequately and 
transparently regulated. Within these groups we contribute 
to discussions regarding current and new regulations, 
including CRD IV/CRR, MiFID II, Reg AT and market 
regulations. We will continue to contribute to these 
discussions and will persist in maximizing transparency in 
respect of our industry, its benefits for all market 
participants and fair, orderly and transparent financial 
markets.
trading rules of all venues on which we trade, our regulatory 
landscape is vast. Legislators and regulators worldwide 
strengthen their supervision within our environment, 
demanding a professional and well-structured compliance 
organization.
Our Compliance department assists management and 
operations at Group and local level by identifying, advising 
on, reviewing and reporting on regulations. It also seeks to 
maintain a compliant business environment through training 
and monitoring in order to ensure and enhance the Group’s 
conformance with its regulatory obligations. 
The Compliance and Risk and Mid-Office departments have 
promulgated and implemented pre-trade risk controls, 
internal rules and regulations that were developed following 
regulatory requirements, guidelines from market 
authorities, industry best practices and our own best 
practices.
Laws and regulations, including tax laws, are subject to 
change or can be interpreted differently in practice over 
time. While we believe we are well-positioned to address 
and implement new or changing regulations in general, and 
while we spend considerable resources to anticipate and 
implement new or changing regulations, we typically cannot 
(fully) assess what the impact of such regulations will 
eventually be in practice. New regulations or revised 
interpretations of regulations may or may not be beneficial 
to our business.
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements could adversely affect our 
reputation, profitability and prospects. This may also be the 
case for differences in interpretation or lack of timely or 
complete implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, disgorgements and 
platform, analysing real-time pricing data, and is designed to 
ensure that our order activity is conducted within strict 
pre-determined trading and position limits. For example, 
our pre-trade risk controls are designed to prevent the 
trading engines from sending orders which deviate from our 
pre-defined risk parameters, such as price and volume limits 
set by the Risk Management department, which keeps our 
ordering, trading and positions well within tolerance levels. 
Our monitoring tools reconcile trades, prices and positions 
against those of our exchanges and prime brokers. Our IT 
systems are regularly subjected to penetration tests by 
external experts. We have a comprehensive IT security 
system that is designed to protect us from attacks both 
from inside and outside the platform. 
Where we have a technical interface with institutions like our 
prime brokers and exchanges, the integrity of the 
connection between the systems and the data that is being 
exchanged is subject to prior conformance testing and 
continuous monitoring. Unexpected deviations are flagged 
and investigated. We also have a disaster recovery plan in 
place, which, for instance, provides that our Amsterdam 
office acts as a backup site for other offices.
Regulatory risk
While we have no clients and do not provide investment 
services or ancillary services to third parties, our markets 
and nearly all aspects of our business are heavily regulated. 
Where applicable, entities forming part of our Group have 
obtained the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses. 
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in four 
international jurisdictions. As a Group we currently trade on 
more than 100 venues worldwide. In addition, we operate on 
various other venues through brokers. As we have to comply 
with our home regulations and the local regulations and

In control statement
The Management Board is responsible for designing and 
maintaining an adequate system for risk management and 
internal control. In order to facilitate this, the Risk and 
Mid-Office department assessed the controls in this process 
and reported its findings to the Management Board. These 
findings have been evaluated by the Management Board 
and by the Supervisory Board. For a more elaborate 
explanation of our efforts in this regard, please refer to the 
Our Risk Management chapter.
On the basis of the above, and in accordance with best

and with due observance of the limitations stated below, we 
confirm that to the best of our knowledge:

failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk 
management and control systems; 
◾
◾
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial reporting does not contain 
any material inaccuracies; 
◾
◾
Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justified that the financial reporting is 
prepared on a going concern basis; and 
◾
◾
The report states those material risks and uncertainties 
that are relevant to the expectation of the company’s 
continuity for the period of twelve months after the 
preparation of the report.
However, these systems cannot provide absolute certainty 
that no errors have occurred or that our targets will be 
achieved, or that a misstatement of Flow Traders’ financial 
statements can be prevented.

Message of the Chairman
In 2017, the Supervisory Board focused on a range of topics 
that will further strengthen equal opportunity, innovation, 
and long-term value creation within the company. These 
included relevant changes to the Corporate Governance 
Code, strategy-associated risks, the impact of new 
legislation and regulations, as well as investments, 
remuneration, and the company’s financial results. 
The Supervisory Board also implemented the outcomes of 
its 2016 self-assessment, which resulted in adjustments to 
the structure of the Supervisory Board’s committees.
Company developments
Despite a year characterized by lower volatility and 
decreased market activity, the company again managed to 
increase its global market share. It also began moving into 
new markets, becoming both a liquidity provider to FX 
markets and opening an office in Hong Kong, helping 
support institutional trading and reaffirming the company’s 
role in the ETP ecosystem in the region. In tandem, work 
continued on internal developments that the company 
believes will lead to future growth opportunities. 
A year in review
Over the course of the year, the Supervisory Board discussed 
a range of topics at its regular meetings and within its four 
committees. These committees were reviewed during the

Supervisory Board’s 2016 self-assessment, with some 
committees successfully merged. In 2017, the committees 
were composed as follows: an Audit Committee, 
a Remuneration and Appointment Committee, a Trading and 
Technology Committee, and a Risk Committee.
New legislation and regulation, including changes to the 
Corporate Governance Code, were discussed at Supervisory 
Board meetings throughout the year. Topics covered 
included long-term value creation, culture, equal 
opportunities, MiFID II, and capital requirements. Many of 
these subjects are already very familiar to the company. 
For example, long-term value creation has always been an 
integral part of Flow Traders’ strategy, with a large 
percentage of the IT and development budget linked to 
originating new ventures and ideas that will lead to further 
growth. 
Following on from this year’s self-assessment, the 
Supervisory Board also introduced a number of additional 
education days for its members. This gave the Supervisory 
Board the opportunity to gain greater insights into topics 
that are particularly pertinent to Flow Traders’ business, 
such as compliance and risk.
During its regular meetings, the Supervisory Board discussed 
the introduction of culture as a separate aspect of good 
governance within the Corporate Governance Code. 
The Supervisory Board believes that Flow Traders has 
a unique culture that should be nurtured. During the year, 
the company carried out a survey that measured employees’ 
views on Flow Traders’ internal culture, and how this culture 
can be preserved. The Supervisory Board discussed the 
survey’s outcomes, and concluded that it is vital that the 
company culture is maintained in a sustainable fashion as 
the company grows.
The Supervisory Board held a special session on IT security 
and on IT architecture in 2017, both of which are key to the 
company’s current and future success. The Supervisory 
Board drew up a new Equal Opportunity Policy, which 
underlines the company’s objective to treating everyone 
equally, irrespective of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, 
or religious beliefs during the hiring process and throughout 
their careers at Flow Traders. This policy is also applicable to 
the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, where 
Flow Traders believes that equal opportunities are as 
relevant.
Over the course of the year, the Supervisory Board 
monitored the company’s progress towards meeting the 
regulatory requirements under MiFID II and, together with 
the Management Board, concluded that the company mi be 
ready for the implementation date. The Supervisory Board 
also paid particular attention to the implications of the EU 
Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), and discussed any 
impact this might have on the company’s remuneration 
policy in the future.
Looking ahead
Looking further into 2018, the Supervisory Board will 
continue to focus on long-term value creation, while 
tracking regulatory developments. The Supervisory Board 
will follow the implementation of MiFID II, follow and 
discuss developments linked to CRR, and supervise those 
projects that the company began in 2017.

times without holding a formal Supervisory Board meeting. 
Examples of meetings without holding a formal meeting 
include a preparation day for the AGM, education and 
strategy days and the self-assessment day. During these 
meetings a number of topics, including the following, were 
discussed:
◾
◾
The new Corporate Governance Code 
The new requirements of the Corporate Governance 
Code were discussed regularly. As stated in the 
Our Governance chapter, the By-Laws of the 
Supervisory Board and Management Board, as well as 
the Terms of Reference of the company’s committees, 
were amended accordingly. Topics including long-term 
value creation, strategy, culture and diversity were the 
main discussion points during 2017. 
◾
◾
The company’s strategy  
The company’s Management Board focuses on the 
long-term value creation of the company and has 
involved the Supervisory Board in translating this 
long-term value creation into the company’s strategy. 
The Supervisory Board regularly discusses the strategy, 
the implementation of the strategy, and any associated 
risks. In September 2017, a Strategy Day was held to 
comprehensively discuss the company’s strategy. 
The Management Board has also set non-financial KPIs, 
which are further explained in the Remuneration 
chapter.

Evaluation of the Management Board 
The performance of the Management Board is discussed 
three times a year between the Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board and an alternating representative of the 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee. During 
performance discussions the representatives talk with the 
Management Board members individually and with the 
Management Board as a whole. Guiding structures for these 
conversations include the Management Board KPI overview 
and the strategic project goals set for 2017. Based on these 
discussions the Remuneration and Appointment Committee 
provides feedback regarding its view on the Management 
Board’s performance to the Supervisory Board, to guide 
year-end discussion on variable rewards.
Profile of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board profile provides that the 
qualifications of a particular candidate and fit with the 
company’s needs shall always prevail when filling a position. 
When selecting members, the Supervisory Board aims for 
a balance in nationality, gender, age, experience, and active 
or retired backgrounds. In addition, balance in the 
experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the 
business of the company will be sought. The Supervisory 
Board strives to realize a diverse composition in the 
nomination and appointment process for vacancies of its 
members, while taking into account the overall profile and 
selection criteria for appointments of suitable candidates to 
the Supervisory Board. As such, diversity, including gender-
related, is an important consideration in the selection 
process for the (re-)appointment of Supervisory Board 
members. In 2017, the Supervisory Board has thoroughly 
reviewed and reconfirmed the Supervisory Board Profile. 
The Profile can be found on our website: 
www.flowtraders.com.
Evaluation of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of the 
self-assessment of 2016, and the follow-up on conclusions 
of that self-assessment. The follow up has led to a reform 
of the structure and number of the Supervisory Board’s 
committees. Another conclusion led to the organization of 
a joint Strategy Day, attended by both the Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board. 
In 2017, the Supervisory Board once again reviewed its own 
performance using the same survey, thus allowing for 
comparisons with last year’s results. Compared to 2016, the 
Supervisory Board concluded that its overall functioning has 
improved. Specific items for follow up that arose this year 
included continued focus on strategy, the composition of 
the Supervisory Board and in-depth knowledge of the 
business of Flow Traders. Other positions of Supervisory 
Board members were also reviewed as part of the 
self-assessment.
As of this year, the Supervisory Board’s self-assessment 
includes an independence-assessment. This independence 
assessment was led by Eric Drok as independent Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board and Rudolf Ferscha as independent 
Chairman of the Remuneration and Appointment 
Committee. Following the assessment, the Supervisory 
Board determined the independence of the board members 
Olivier Bisserier, Rudolf Ferscha, Eric Drok and Han Sikkens. 
Roger Hodenius and Jan van Kuijk were considered 
non-independent Supervisory Board members. See the Our 
Governance chapter for more information. 
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy)
The Supervisory Board has drawn up and adopted an Equal 
Opportunity Policy on 2 November 2017. In this policy we 
explain our objective to treat everyone equally during the 
hiring process and throughout their careers at Flow Traders. 
We are committed to being a truly equal opportunity 
employer, by recruiting, retaining and promoting people 
based on merit, and merit alone. We are a firm believer in 
the benefits of a diverse workplace and we do not make any 
concessions to quality. Our objective is to provide equal 
employment opportunities to all qualified job applicants 
and equal career perspectives for all of our employees, 
provided they perform highly. When positions become 
available, we actively encourage all candidates to apply and 
ensure that the selection and retention processes are truly 
equal for all applicants and employees. This also holds for 
our Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it 
comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, we adhere to the same principle of 
equal opportunity as set out above. As a result, our current 
Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of, inter alia, age, 
education, nationality, and professional backgrounds. 
No Supervisory Board or Management Board Members were 
appointed or reappointed during the financial year 2017. 
Our Equal Opportunity Policy can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com. 
Independence of the Supervisory Board
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is not a former 
member of the company’s Management Board and is 
independent within the meaning of best practice provision 
2.1.8 of the Corporate Governance Code. Jan van Kuijk and 
Roger Hodenius do not qualify as independent under the 
provisions of the Corporate Governance Code as they, as our 
founders, are former members of the company’s

Management Board, prior to conversion, and represent 
shareholders of the company. Han Sikkens no longer 
represents a shareholder of the company who holds at least 
10 percent of the shares. Given a legal analysis from our 
advisors and following confirmation of our independence 
assessment, Han Sikkens is now considered an independent 
Supervisory Board member. 
Committees
The Supervisory Board has four committees: an Audit 
Committee, a Remuneration and Appointment Committee, 
a Trading and Technology Committee, and a Risk Committee. 
Each committee has a preparatory and/or advisory role to 
the Supervisory Board and reports to the Supervisory Board 
accordingly. Both the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
the Chairman of the Remuneration and Appointment 
Committee qualify as independent under the provisions of 
the Corporate Governance Code. The Trading and 
Technology Committee and the Risk Committee were 
established to cater for the monitoring of and advising on 
specific business related topics and reflect our business 
model of focusing on pricing, cutting-edge technology 
platform and risk management. These committees are 
chaired by the founders and former Management Board 
members of the company. For more information on the 
responsibilities of our committees, please refer to the 
chapter Our Governance. 
The composition of the committees is as follows:

The committees report to the Supervisory Board by sharing 
their advice and recommendations during the Supervisory 
Board meetings and by circulating the minutes of the 
meetings or reports. All meetings were held at the 
company’s offices in Amsterdam.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee met five times in 2017, with each 
meeting fully attended. Other attendees included one of 
the Co-CEOs, the CFO, the Global Co-Head of Finance and 
Tax, the external auditor and the Group Internal Auditor, who 
had a standing invitation to each meeting.
During these meetings the Committee discussed the annual 
results, the half-yearly results and the quarterly results and 
shared the items discussed with the Supervisory Board. 
Other topics discussed included the Management Board’s 
methods for the assessment of the effectiveness of the 
design and operation of the company’s internal risk and 
control systems, new and proposed legislative initiatives 
related to accounting, auditing and financial reporting, tax 
planning, tax strategy and monitoring, the company’s 
compliance with rules and regulations, the company’s Code 
of Conduct and Whistle-blower Policy, the company’s 
financing strategy (including the interim dividend proposal) 
and the methods used to assess the effectiveness of the 
internal and external audit processes. The company’s 
external auditor, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP (EY), 
attended all meetings. Topics discussed with the external 
auditor included their unqualified interim review report, their 
Audit Plan for the financial year of 2017 and 
recommendations on the basis of the annual report and 
financial statements over the financial year 2016. The Audit 
Committee reviewed the recommendations included in the 
auditor’s report, as issued by the external auditor and 
discussed the actions taken by management to address any 
recommendations and observations. The Audit Committee 
evaluates the performance of the external auditor and 
discusses this with the Supervisory Board and subsequently 
with the external auditor. In light of this, the Audit 
Committee advises the Supervisory Board about the 
reappointment of the external auditor, before the 
Supervisory Board determines its nomination for the 
appointment of the external auditor to the General Meeting. 
Given the nature of our business, the application of 
information and communication technology by the 
company, including risks relating to cyber security, are 
discussed in detail in the Trading and Technology

of the company is discussed in this committee, all of the 
Supervisory Board members are now members of the 
Trading and Technology Committee. The committee 
discussed the company’s IT budget for 2018, IT-related 
investments and expenses, the main technology-related 
risks facing the company and the focus on recruiting new 
talent. Recurring items were the state of the company’s 
hardware and software infrastructure, innovation, 
cyber-security, and HR-related topics. 
The Trading and Technology Committee was also briefed by 
the Global Head of Trading on developments in the Trading 
department, including -amongst others- growth areas, 
budget matters, diversification of products and markets 
traded. The developments of the new FX trading desk were 
also discussed. Another recurring topic of discussion was the 
slow market conditions during the year. 
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met three times in 2017, with each 
meeting fully attended. Invitees of the meeting were the 
Management Board members and Global Head of Risk and 
Mid-Office. The main focus in the meetings was the 
Management Board’s risk assessment. The attendees 
discussed in detail the relevant risks the company is 
exposed to, the internal controls in place to address these 
risks, the Management Board’s views on such risks, as well 
as the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
internal risk management and control system. 
The committee has discussed the way material risks and 
uncertainties have been analyzed and discussed.

recommendations, management feedback and follow-up). 
The Audit Committee maintains regular dialogue with the 
IAF. More information can be found in the chapter Our 
Governance.
Remuneration and Appointment Committee
The Remuneration and Appointment Committee met four 
times in 2017. All meetings were fully attended. Other 
attendees to the meetings included the Management Board 
and the Global Head of HRM & Recruitment. During the 
meetings the Remuneration and Appointment Committee 
reviewed the company’s General Remuneration Policy, 
prepared the Equal Opportunity Policy, and drafted 
proposals to the Supervisory Board for the remuneration 
practices to be pursued for the Management Board and 
staff of the company. It also outlined proposals for the 
remuneration of the individual members of the 
Management Board for adoption by the Supervisory Board. 
The size, composition and functioning of the Supervisory 
Board and Management Board was reviewed and findings 
reported to the Supervisory Board. Other duties included 
the monitoring of developments of the Corporate 
Governance Code and regulations in relation to 
remuneration policies and the preparation of the 
Remuneration Report.
Before determination of the remuneration of the 
Management Board members, the Remuneration and 
Appointment Committee took note of the individual 
Management Board members’ views with regard to the 
amount and structure of their own remuneration.
Trading and Technology Committee
The Trading and Technology Committee met three times in 
2017, with each meeting fully attended. As the core business 
Committee. Subsequently, key items in respect of these 
items are also discussed in the Audit Committee.
External auditor
The Audit Committee and the Management Board reported 
to the Supervisory Board on EY’s functioning as the external 
auditor, the company’s relationship with the external 
auditor, on its fees, as well as on other audit and non-audit 
services it provided to the company. EY performed a review 
of the company’s interim financial statements and issued an 
unqualified review report. The Audit Committee evaluated 
the qualifications, performance and independence of EY, 
taking into account the opinions of the Management Board. 
The Audit Committee also obtained a report from the 
external auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. EY confirmed its independence 
from Flow Traders in accordance with the professional 
standards applicable to it. EY’s lead audit partner was 
present at all of the Audit Committee meetings held in 2017. 
Based on the information provided by the Audit Committee, 
the Supervisory Board nominated EY as external auditor at 
the company’s General Meeting in 2017. Subsequently, EY 
was reappointed by the General Meeting as external auditor 
for the financial year 2017.
Internal audit function 
The internal audit function (IAF) executed audits that form 
part of the internal audit plan, approved by the Supervisory 
Board. Focus areas in this audit plan included the company’s 
systems and controls, operational resilience, data handling, 
payment process and reconciliation of trading positions. 
The IAF performed a number of specific reviews at the 
request of the Management Board and the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee and the Group Internal 
Auditor discussed the audit results (findings, observations,

is calculated by dividing the total of their fixed based 
salaries and variable remuneration by the number of FTEs 
(three). The company-wide average is calculated in similar 
fashion by adding up fixed salaries and variable 
remuneration and dividing by the number of FTEs (394.4). 
Due to the nature of our business activities and the 
compensation structure of the Management Board, the 
Supervisory Board tracks the actual performance of the 
Management Board members and eligibility for variable 
remuneration throughout the year, with quarterly 
discussions taking place to facilitate this. Please see the 
section on Analyses carried out in respect of variable 
remuneration in the chapter on Remuneration for a more 
detailed description.
No current or former Management Board member received 
a severance payment in 2017. 
Thank you
Finally, the Supervisory Board would like to thank the 
members of the Management Board and all of Flow Traders’ 
employees for their tireless efforts and resilience.

company’s profit in any given year. In that sense, our General 
Remuneration Policy works as a risk-mitigating tool and 
a self-correcting mechanism. If there is no profit, no variable 
remuneration will be awarded. If there is profit, variable 
remuneration is available for all employees and the 
Management Board. The cap for the variable remuneration 
is set at 40 percent minus applicable adjustments (e.g. taxes, 
capital charges and extraordinary items). In practice, the net 
percentage has historically amounted to approximately 36 
percent of our operating result and this guideline continues 
to apply going forward. If the company incurs a loss, 
deferred variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited 
entirely. 
In accordance with the global remuneration model in place 
for all employees, the members of the Management Board 
are entitled to annual variable compensation based on 
performance in respect of individual criteria and their 
contribution to the success of the company as whole. These 
criteria reflect quantitative and qualitative criteria related to 
non-financial performance. Variable remuneration, if 
awarded, is paid in cash in multiple instalments, providing 
a strong incentive for long-term value creation. Instalments 
may be reduced or clawed back under circumstances 
described in the Remuneration Act, Dutch corporate law and 
the Corporate Governance Code. Please see the section on 
the Remuneration of the members of the Management 
Board in the chapter on Remuneration for a more detailed 
description. 
In 2017, the total average compensation of the individual 
Management Board members amounted to €507,029 
compared to the company-wide average compensation paid 
per employee of €145,520 resulting in a pay-ratio of 3.5 
(2016: 5). The average compensation of the Board Members 
Financial statements and dividend
The 2017 financial statements were prepared by the 
Management Board. They were discussed both with the 
Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, in attendance 
of EY. The financial statements were audited by EY, who 
issued an unqualified auditor’s report. Reference is made  
to the auditor’s report on page 111 of the financial 
statements. The Supervisory Board approved the financial 
statements as audited by EY, including the company’s 
dividend proposal. We invite the General Meeting to:
◾
◾
adopt the financial statements for 2017;
◾
◾
adopt the dividend proposal as proposed by the 
Management Board and approved by the Supervisory 
Board; and
◾
◾
discharge the Management Board for their 
management and the Supervisory Board for its 
supervision of the company in the financial year under 
review.
Remuneration report 
The General Remuneration Policy was approved in 2016 and 
has been reviewed by the Remuneration and Appointment 
committee in 2017 to ensure it remains relevant and is suited 
to the size of our enterprise and the way it is organized, as 
well as the nature, scope and complexity of our business 
activities. 
The remuneration of the Management Board consists of 
a relatively modest fixed base salary and a variable 
compensation in cash. The awarding of variable 
remuneration to the members of the Management Board – 
as well as to all employees – is entirely dependent on the

Pre-electronic trading era
How did exchange trading develop in the 
Netherlands?
The Dutch are a sea-faring nation, and 
trading is an integral part of our culture. 
So it’s perhaps no surprise that the 
Amsterdam Stock Exchange was 
established at the beginning of the 17th 
century by the Dutch East India Company, 
who wanted a fixed location to issue 
bonds and shares to the general public. 
The markets underwent continuing 
professionalization over the centuries, and 
then in the mid- to late 20th century we 
saw the introduction of derivatives. 
The opening of the European Option 
Exchange in Amsterdam in the late 1970s 
and the creation of the first European 
index was a key moment, as it provided 
market participants with a new way to 
invest. It helped them better deal with 
risk, for example by hedging, and enabled 
them to use speculation as an investment 
strategy. You could also argue that some 
of today’s liquidity providers had their 
genesis around this period, as it was the 
first time many parties looked at trading 
from a more conceptual and algorithmic 
perspective.
Electronic trading era
What was the impact of the switch to 
electronic trading?
I was involved in the automation process 
when we were preparing to switch to 
electronic trading. One of the main 
impacts of automation was that it 
formalized market behavior. It made it 
much clearer to participants which types 
of orders were in the market, enabling 
investors to better review risk by 
understanding what was happening at  
any given moment. For liquidity providers, 
this created a much stronger link between 
trading and the commercial and 
risk-related aspects of the business. 
For investors, it increased transparency 
and helped them make more qualified 
investment decisions. 
And the impact on Euronext? 
There were a number of positive 
developments for us. First, it helped us to 
further strengthen our trading safeguards, 
which are an incremental part of our 
market surveillance. The automation 
allowed us to better follow trends in the 
market. For example, we were able to 
introduce circuit-breakers, such as the 
static collar, which automatically halts 
trading on a stock in case of wide price 
fluctuations. Such safeguards give the 
market confidence, as investors know that 
our trading platform and matching engine 
will respond in a pre-defined and 
predictable way. Another example is in our 
derivatives market, where we automat-
ically reject orders that breach our price 
range, meaning the order doesn’t even 
enter the market, improving risk 
management. And second, it led to an 
enormous increase in trading, something 
that can only be achieved if people can 
make prices with confidence. 
Why do you think Amsterdam was one of 
the first cities to switch to electronic 
trading?
I think as a city we’re entrepreneurial and 
pragmatic, which helps when you want to 
innovate. And the Dutch have always had 
to work together to solve large issues, >>

such as flood control, which leads to 
developing consensus-driven solutions. 
And despite being a relatively small 
country, we have managed to be involved 
in large events around the world. 
What are the main trends you have 
witnessed within the trading environment 
over the last ten years?
The overall trend is towards more passive 
investments, with a drive towards 
investing in a range of instruments 
through ETFs. Another significant trend is 
the availability of information and the 
speed with which market participants can 
react to that information. This is a trend 
that has been developing for centuries, of 
course, and every time there is a techno-
logical jump, there’s a corresponding 
increase in the availability of information. 
However, it’s even more pertinent now, 
given the incredible response times of 
today’s liquidity providers.
What are some of the issues affecting 
liquidity providers?
One of the main issues is ensuring that 
they comply with national and interna-
tional regulations, such as MiFID II. This is 
a requirement for them if they want to be 
able to trade effectively now and in the 
future. Some 10 years ago the trend was to 
assume we would be going to one global 
integrated market. Nowadays, we see 
a trend that countries and their markets 
are becoming more fragmented. It will be 
important for traders to stay connected to 
these markets, and specifically the ones 
with material liquidity.
Insights for the future
What will liquidity provision look like in the 
future?
Markets and liquidity providers need to be 
up-to-speed on pricing relevant 
information. The type of information and 
the way to integrate that in their trading is 
changing. To explain this, I see this as 
being similar to the evolution of expres-
sionist art. There was a long period when 
artists would create a painting in their 
studio, always in the same format. 
The paint tube was invented, and suddenly 
artists were free to go out in the field and 
express themselves in completely 
different ways. The same thing is 
happening with data. People were used to 
having access to one source of data, which 
was the official market price, and it was 
this price that everyone would react on. 
Today, liquidity providers are using a range 
of tools, such as Artificial Intelligence data 
analysis and high-speed data processing, 
to better value and price stocks. These 
developments will continue, and liquidity 
providers will have to adapt their models 
accordingly. 
Which trends do you see impacting trading 
in the coming ten years?
One of the clearest recent developments, 
which has the potential to impact trading 
going forward, is Brexit. Many parties are 
looking at what that means for markets, 
and asking themselves whether the UK 
and EU will run financial services under 
the same rules. Another development is 
the rise of fintech, which I think has the 
potential to shake up markets, especially 
those that could be more transparent  
and efficient. For example, the bond 
market is particularly opaque, so I could 
envisage new players looking for ways  
to trade or issue bonds in a more 
transparent way. And any area of the 
market that introduces greater 
transparency creates an opportunity  
for liquidity providers.

Remuneration
We want to attract and retain the best talent 
available. We believe that awarding an attractive 
and competitive remuneration package is an 
important part of our proposition to candidates 
and employees. Therefore, we offer our 
employees a combination of fixed and variable 
pay. We share a single, firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool and people are awarded a 
share of that pool based on their performance. 
No variable remuneration is awarded if there is no 
or insufficient profit or capital. 
Introduction
We not only create transparency in the financial markets, we 
also firmly believe in being transparent as a company. 
Our global remuneration model provides for a detailed and 
transparent awarding procedure with appropriate checks 
and balances and publication requirements. The company 
has discussed the company’s remuneration model with 
regulators, legislators, major shareholder representatives 
and shareholder representative bodies.
Key principles and policy
Our global remuneration model reflects our key principles 
achieved through the practical implementation of the 
General Remuneration Policy (as approved by the General 
Meeting on 19 May 2016 and published on our website,  
the ‘General Remuneration Policy’), the Dutch Act  
on Remuneration Policy of Financial Undertakings  
(Wet Beloningsbeleid Financiële Ondernemingen, the 
‘Remuneration Act’), and the related laws and regulations  
in a manner that is tailored to the size of our enterprise and 
the way it is organized, as well as the nature, scope and 
complexity of our business activities.
It is consistent with, and promotes, sound and effective risk 
management. It encourages alignment of the risks taken by 
employees and of the company itself, and does not 
encourage risk taking which is inconsistent with our risk 
profile. It is in line with our business strategy, objectives, 
values and interests and includes measures to avoid 
conflicts of interest. Finally, it must not lead to the risk that 
third parties are treated improperly (although we do not 
provide any investment service or ancillary service to third 
parties). 
Our global remuneration model
We are committed to attracting and retaining the best talent 
available. Our staff, including the members of the 
Management Board, receive competitive remuneration 
packages. This includes a fixed gross salary and an award 
from the singular firm-wide variable remuneration pool. 
The remuneration pool is accrued throughout the year 
based on Flow Traders’ operating result over the 
performance year reflecting company performance. 
The variable component of the total remuneration is 
dynamic, as it is a function of operating results: if there is no 
or insufficient profit or capital, there will be no variable 
remuneration. For example, if in any given year no profit is 
made, none of our employees will receive any variable 
remuneration. If the company incurs a loss, deferred 
variable remuneration is reduced or forfeited entirely. 
This policy also applies to members of the Management 
Board. 
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the beginning of 
each calendar year clear objectives are set depending on an 
employee’s role, which are in line with our company 
objectives for the year and our corporate key competencies: 
drive, ownership and teamwork. Performance is reviewed 
during mid-year and year-end staff appraisals.

compensation package in 2017. We do not provide any other 
ancillary benefits for any employee. We have not reserved 
or accrued any amounts to cover pension claims or 
retirement claims.
One of our core values is ownership, and we mean it both in 
terms of mindset and behavior as well as literally. We believe 
that being a shareholder aligns the interests of the company 
with those of our employees. To promote shareholding and 
reward loyalty we have launched two new initiatives: the 
Flow Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and the Flow Loyalty 
Incentive Plan (FLIP). Under the FCIP employees have been 
offered the opportunity to buy company shares in the first 
open period of 2018 and receive an attractive annual cash 
incentive over a five-year period for as long as the shares are 
held by the participant. The right to the cash incentive will be 
forfeited if the participant transfers his or her shares out of 
the FCIP or when the employment of the participant with 
Flow Traders ends. With the FLIP program, company shares 
are awarded to employees marking their two-year 
anniversary with the company. Shares awarded under the 
FLIP are subject to a lock-up period and will remain with the 
employee regardless of the termination of his or her 
employment with Flow Traders. The cash incentive under the 
FCIP as well as the shares awarded under the FLIP are fully 
paid out of the variable compensation pool. The FCIP and 
the FLIP terms and conditions are subject to review by the 
Management Board annually. Both plans have been 
approved by the Supervisory Board in Q4 2017. As a part of 
these plans shares have been and will be bought in the 
market. The Management Board is not eligible to participate 
in either of these plans.
company’s risk profile and horizon. Variable remuneration 
components may become subject to reduction or claw back 
if it is determined that the relevant employee or member of 
the Management Board did not meet adequate norms of 
competence and appropriate behavior or was responsible 
for behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of the 
company’s position, in accordance with applicable law.
We do not award guaranteed variable remuneration to 
employees unless the guaranteed variable component is 
awarded in relation to hiring new staff, limited to the first 
year of employment, and only if we have a sound and strong 
capital base. We do not award severance payments if there 
is a serious imputable act or negligence by the employee in 
the fulfilment of his or her function or where an employee 
resigns voluntarily (unless this is the consequence of 
a serious imputable act or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar 
handelen of nalaten) by the company). Employees did not 
receive any loans from the company as part of their 
Individual variable remuneration payable from the collective 
variable compensation pool is dependent on company and 
business unit performance, individual performance and the 
individual’s contribution to the long-term success of the 
company as a whole, discouraging a culture of ‘star’ behavior 
and fostering collaboration and teamwork. Flow Traders 
does not base variable remuneration on financial results 
achieved individually. The Supervisory Board approves the 
awarding of variable remuneration.
If awarded, for most recipients variable remuneration is paid 
in cash in two or three annual instalments. The deferred 
variable component acts as a first loss tranche to 
compensate for any operating loss in the subsequent year, 
acting as a buffer before such loss would impact 
shareholder equity. This serves as an important incentive for 
risk-aware behavior, keeping in mind the long-term 
objectives of the company and alignment with our risk 
appetite. We deem the deferral period sufficient given the

We encourage our employees to save for old age. At our 
headquarters in Amsterdam, we partnered with a pension 
provider, giving employees the freedom of choice to select 
the option that best suits their individual needs while 
incentivizing participation in the company-sponsored 
program. In our other offices we offer schemes that are 
driven by country-specific practices and regulations. 
Remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board
Introduction
The remuneration of, and other agreements with, the 
members of the Management Board are required to be 
determined by the Supervisory Board with due observance 
of the General Remuneration Policy and applicable laws and 
regulations. The Supervisory Board has assessed the 
remuneration of our Management Board members based on 
their performance in 2017.
The remuneration of our Management Board members 
consists of a relatively modest fixed base salary and 
a variable, partially deferred, remuneration in cash. 
The table below shows the total remuneration awarded to 
the individual members of the Management Board over 
2017.

provisions of the Remuneration Act, Dutch law and the 
Corporate Governance Code provide that the remuneration 
of the members of the Management Board may be reduced 
or they may be obliged to repay (part of) their variable 
remuneration to the company if certain circumstances 
apply.
Pursuant to the applicable laws and regulations, any variable 
remuneration component conditionally awarded to 
a member of the Management Board in a previous financial 
year which would, in the opinion of the Supervisory Board, 
Adjustments to variable remuneration
Variable remuneration to members of the Management 
Board is paid in cash in multiple instalments and may be 
reduced or clawed back under circumstances described in 
the Remuneration Act. As explained in the section above on 
our global remuneration model, the deferred variable 
component acts as a first loss tranche to compensate any 
operating loss in the subsequent year, before such loss 
would impact shareholder equity. If the company incurs 
a loss, deferred variable remuneration is reduced or 
forfeited entirely. In addition to the reduction and claw back 
Variable remuneration
Based on actual performance over 2017, all members of the 
Management Board were awarded a total combined variable 
remuneration of €1,237,265. The variable remuneration 
awards to the members of the Management Board are 
determined on the basis of the following principles:
◾
◾
First, the maximum variable remuneration is set by the 
Supervisory Board within the limits of the firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool for a given year. As set out 
above, the pool is approximately 36 percent of the 
operating results and is directly contingent upon 
positive operating results. Financial performance 
indicators are therefore integrated into this 
self-correcting mechanism: the variable remuneration 
of the members of the Management Board will be a 
direct reflection of actual realized company 
performance.
◾
◾
Second, within those limits, the variable remuneration is 
determined annually on the basis of a management-
assessment performance framework. This framework 
translates Flow Traders’ strategic business objectives 
into predetermined, assessable performance criteria 
that can be influenced by the Management Board’s 
performance within a Balanced Performance 
Scorecard. This Scorecard is composed of four 
non-financial focus areas, which aim to robustly assess 
the Management Board member’s performance within 
Flow Traders’ operating environment and stakeholder 
interests. These four areas comprise Growth, External 
Relationships, Internal Processes / Excellence, and 
People and Culture. Each year, targets are set for the 
following performance elements, which are assessed 
annually, in order to determine management’s 
performance and variable remuneration:
	 Growth
◾
◾
Strengthen the team
◾
◾
Grow Institutional Trading
◾
◾
Increase product venue coverage
◾
◾
Open Hong Kong office
	 External Relationships
◾
◾
Expand the number of prime brokers
◾
◾
Ensure continuous compliance with rules and 
regulations and maintain positive relationships with 
regulators
◾
◾
Ensure that the investor community is properly 
informed
◾
◾
Deepen relationships with issuers
	 Internal Process / Excellence
◾
◾
Further improve technical infrastructure
◾
◾
Expand analyst capacity
◾
◾
Finalize implementation of Mifid II

Increase overall capital efficiency
	 People & Culture
◾
◾
Launch employee share plan
◾
◾
Set up Flow Academy

◾
Stimulate rotation across offices

Create and maintain a positive and challenging 
environment for employees

year as set out in the best practice provisions of the 
Corporate Governance Code. Quarterly discussions take 
place between the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee for this 
purpose. In this manner the Supervisory Board regularly 
assesses the performance indicators and the potential 
resulting variable remuneration for the Management Board 
members. 
As mentioned, compensation of the members of the 
Management Board is limited to a relatively modest fixed 
remuneration component and a variable component 
dependent on operating result being realized. They did not 
receive share-based remuneration or other elaborate 
incentive schemes. This limits the number of scenarios to be 
meaningfully assessed as prescribed by the best practice 
provisions.
unacceptable according to requirements of reasonableness 
and fairness.
Scenario analyses carried out in respect of variable 
remuneration
The variable remuneration of the members of the 
Management Board is contingent upon a future, unknown, 
metric: the accrued firm-wide variable remuneration pool 
which itself depends on the operating result for the given 
financial year.
Because of the nature of our business activities and the fast 
paced industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable remuneration 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year while 
performing a single, one-off, assessment at the end of the 
produce an unfair result due to extraordinary circumstances 
during the period in which the predetermined performance 
criteria have been or should have been applied, the 
Supervisory Board will have the power to adjust the value 
downwards or upwards. In addition, the Supervisory Board 
will have the authority under applicable Dutch law, including 
the Remuneration Act, to recover any variable remuneration 
awarded from a member of the Management Board on the 
basis of incorrect financial or other data (claw back). 
In addition, variable remuneration components may become 
subject to claw back and malus pursuant to the 
Remuneration Act and related regulations.
Pursuant to Dutch law, the Supervisory Board may 
furthermore adjust the variable remuneration (to the extent 
that it is subject to reaching certain targets and the 
occurrence of certain events) to an appropriate level if 
payment of the variable remuneration were to be

We operate a two-tier governance structure, 
consisting of a Management Board and a 
Supervisory Board. The Management Board is 
responsible for the day-to-day management of 
the company, formulating strategies and policies, 
and setting and achieving our objectives. 
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the 
Management Board. Each board is accountable to 
the General Meeting for the performance of its 
duties. 
Our governance is reflected in our internal rules 
and regulations, including our Articles of 
Association, Management Board By-Laws, 
Supervisory Board By-Laws, the Terms of 
Reference of our Supervisory Board committees 
and our Code of Conduct. These, together with 
our policies, can be found on our website. 
The new Corporate Governance Code came into 
force as of 1 January 2017. Flow Traders 
historically has a strong focus on long-term value 
creation, culture, risk and fully supports the 
amended Corporate Governance Code. We have 
amended our Management Board By-Laws, 
Supervisory Board By-Laws, and the Terms of 
Reference of our Supervisory Board committees 
accordingly. 
Management Board
General
Our Management Board consists of two Co-CEOs (Dennis 
Dijkstra and Sjoerd Rietberg) and one CFO (Marcel 
Jongmans). Two of them can jointly represent the company, 
reflecting the four-eyes principle we operate across the 
company: two people must sign off on significant business 
decisions. The Management Board is charged with managing 
the company, subject to the limitations set out in the 
Articles of Association and the Management Board By-Laws. 
The Management Board is responsible for the continuity of 
the company and is guided by the interests of the company 
and its business, taking into consideration the company’s 
long-term value creation and the interests of the company’s 
stakeholders, including our employees and our 
shareholders. Decisions are thus made in a balanced 
manner. Management has formulated a strategy in line with 
the long-term value creation. Subsequently, Management is 
responsible for creating a culture that entails long-term 
value creation for the company. The Management Board is 
supervised by the Supervisory Board in this regard. 
Management is alert to indications of misconduct or 
irregularities. In accordance with the Corporate Governance 
Code Management has also taken measures to avoid 
conflicts of interest. 
The members of the Management Board are eager to keep 
their knowledge and skills up to date and spend sufficient 
time on their duties and responsibilities.
The Management Board is also responsible for identifying 
and managing risks associated with the company’s strategy 
and activities. Management ensures that the company has 
adequate internal risk management and control systems in 
place. Moreover, the Management Board renders account of 
the effectiveness of the design and the operation of the 
internal risk management and control systems. The Internal 
Audit Function is the responsibility of Management. 
Management maintains regular contact with the Internal 
Audit Function. 
Before the Management Board can approve any resolutions 
entailing a significant change in the identity or nature of the 
company, it must obtain the approval of the General 
Meeting. The Management Board also has to obtain the 
approval of the Supervisory Board for a number of 
resolutions specified in the Management Board By-Laws. 
Appointing and dismissing Management Board 
members
As set out in more detail in our Articles of Association and 
the Management Board By-Laws, the Supervisory Board 
makes a non-binding nomination or proposal to appoint, 
suspend or remove a Management Board member. 
Following a nomination by the Supervisory Board, the 
General Meeting can appoint members of the Management 
Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
representing more than one third of the issued capital of the 
company. Appointment of a different candidate than the 
one proposed by the Supervisory Board requires an absolute 
majority of the votes cast at the General Meeting, 
representing at least 50 percent of the issued capital of the

Appointing and dismissing Supervisory Board members 
Supervisory Board members are appointed for a term of 
four years and may be reappointed for a further four-year 
term. A Supervisory Board member may then be 
reappointed again, for a period of two years, which may be 
extended by at most two years. The Equal Opportunity 
Policy will be taken into account at (re)appointments. 
When a member of the Supervisory Board is to be 
appointed, suspended, or removed, the Supervisory Board 
makes a non-binding nomination or proposal. Following 
a nomination by the Supervisory Board, the General Meeting 
may appoint a Supervisory Board member by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast, representing more than one third 
of the issued capital of the company. Appointment of 
a different candidate than the one proposed by the 
Supervisory Board requires an absolute majority of the votes 
cast at the General Meeting, representing at least 50 percent 
of the issued capital of the company. If votes within the 
Supervisory Board meeting tie on the proposed nomination, 
the General Meeting decides. Supervisory Board members 
are appointed for a maximum term of four years. 
Any appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board 
must be approved by the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). 
DNB needs to be notified in writing in case of 
re-appointments of members of the Supervisory Board.
Following a proposal by the Supervisory Board the General 
Meeting may suspend or remove members of the 
Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast. 
The suspension or removal of a Supervisory Board member 
without a proposal by the Supervisory Board requires an 
absolute majority of the votes cast at the General Meeting, 
representing at least 50 percent of the issued capital of the 
company. 
Supervisory Board
General
The Supervisory Board supervises the Management Board 
and the general course of affairs of the company and its 
business. The Supervisory Board supervises the company’s 
focus on long-term value creation and the way in which this 
is implemented in the company’s strategy and culture. 
The Supervisory Board considers the organizational 
structure of the company as a whole, as well as general and 
financial risks and the internal risk management and control 
systems. In performing its duties, the Supervisory Board acts 
in accordance with the interests of the company and takes 
the relevant interests of the company’s stakeholders into 
account. Decisions are thus made in a balanced manner. 
The Supervisory Board is alert to indications of misconduct 
or irregularities. It supervises the Management Board when 
appropriate follow-up actions are taken. In case of a conflict 
of interest, the Supervisory Board is responsible for the 
decision-making on how to handle conflicts of interest. 
The functioning of the Supervisory Board as a whole and the 
functioning of members individually is evaluated at least 
once a year. A succession plan for the Supervisory Board is in 
place, with the Supervisory Board Profile taken into account. 
We also have a transparent procedure in place for the (re)
appointment of Supervisory Board members. 
In 2017 the Supervisory Board consisted of six members:

The Remuneration and Appointment Committee is not 
chaired by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or 
a former member of the Management Board. 
Risk Committee
The duties of the Risk Committee include supervising and 
monitoring the operation of our internal risk management 
and control systems, and advising the Management Board 
on these operations. It reviews the company’s risk 
assessment processes and control systems, at least 
annually. The committee also monitors the manner in which 
the company’s risk management function is provided with 
adequate resources and appropriate access to information, 
bearing in mind that it should be able to function sufficiently 
independently from Management. The Risk Committee also 
undertakes preparatory work for the Supervisory Board’s 
decision-making regarding the supervision of the integrity 
and quality of the effectiveness of the company’s internal 
risk management and control systems. Subsequently, the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal risk 
management and control systems are discussed with the 
Management Board, and reported to the Supervisory Board.
The Committee maintains regular contact with our Risk and 
Mid-Office departments. The Global Head of this 
department and relevant others are invited to committee 
meetings.
Trading and Technology Committee
The Trading and Technology Committee is responsible for 
providing advice to the Management Board on the 
company’s development, performance and sustainability of 
its trading strategies. It is also responsible for reviewing the 
company’s technology budget, supervising the operation of 
the company’s security systems, and assessing the state of 
In addition to the Co-CEOs and the CFO, the Global Co-Head 
of Tax & Finance was invited to Audit Committee meetings. 
The Group Internal Auditor also attends meetings of the 
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is not chaired by the Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board or a former member of the Management 
Board. More than half of its members is independent. 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee
The Remuneration and Appointment Committee drafts 
proposals for the company’s remuneration policy. 
It proposes the remuneration of the individual members of 
the Management Board to the Supervisory Board, and 
reviews the proposal of the Management Board of the 
annual remuneration and variable compensations of all 
employees. It is also responsible for carrying out annual 
assessments of the individual members of the Supervisory 
Board and the Management Board and the composition and 
size of the respective boards. Where necessary, the 
Remuneration and Appointment committee drafts 
proposals for (re)appointments, drafts selection criteria and 
appointment procedures for the Supervisory Board and 
Management Board. The Committee draws up a plan for the 
succession of Management Board and Supervisory Board 
members. It also supervises the Management Board 
regarding the selection criteria and appointment procedures 
for senior management. 
Depending on the topics discussed, the Co-CEOs, CFO or 
relevant Global Heads and relevant others are present at 
committee meetings.
Internal organization
Committees
The Supervisory Board has amended the structure of its 
committees following last year’s self-assessment. 
The company used to have an Audit Committee, 
a Remuneration and Appointment Committee, a Trading and 
Risk Committee and a Technology Committee. As trading 
and technology have many similar intersections, both 
committees have been reformed to a Trading and 
Technology Committee and a separate Risk Committee. 
Each of the committees has a preparatory and/or advisory 
role to the Supervisory Board. They each report their 
findings to the Supervisory Board, which is ultimately 
responsible for all decision-making. Terms of Reference 
apply for each committee and the Co-CEOs and CFO have 
a standing invitation for each committee meeting. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee discusses the quarterly, interim,  
and annual figures and supervises the provision of the 
company’s financial information. It also advises the 
Supervisory Board on the nomination of the external 
auditor, who is appointed by the General Meeting. It is in 
regular contact with the internal audit function and the 
external auditor, monitors the auditor’s independence and 
discusses the audit plans of the internal and external 
auditor. 
In addition to advising the Management Board on financing, 
tax policy and tax risk framework, it is also responsible for 
supervising relevant (tax) legislation and regulations and 
codes of conduct. The design and operation of the internal 
risk management and control systems are discussed in the 
Risk Committee in more detail, as well as in the Audit 
Committee.

General Meeting, shares and shareholders 
Flow Traders highly encourages shareholder participation in 
the decision-making in the General Meeting. It is of great 
importance to Flow Traders that its shareholders have an 
actual say in the annual general meeting of shareholders 
(‘AGM’), and the company therefore encourages an open 
dialogue. Flow Traders ensures that the General Meeting is 
adequately provided with information.
Agenda items of the AGM that need to be handled as 
separate agenda items on the basis of the Corporate 
Governance Code, will be handled as such. 
Flow Traders holds an AGM within six months of the end of 
the financial year. The agenda for this meeting includes the 
adoption of the annual accounts, the content of the annual 
report covering the previous year’s financial business, the 
policy of the company on additions to reserves and on 
distributions of profits, any proposal to distribute profits, (re)
appointment of the external auditor, substantial changes in 
the governance structure of the company and in the 
compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, material 
changes to the articles of association, filling vacancies on 
the Management Board and/or Supervisory Board, 
proposals placed on the agenda by the Management Board, 
and the release from liability of the members of the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board for their 
performance during the financial year. 
The report of the Management Board at the General 
Meeting in 2018 will discuss the corporate governance 
structure and how the Corporate Governance Code is 
implemented.

concerns an amendment to the Articles of Association, 
a copy of the proposal in which the proposed amendment is 
quoted verbatim must at the same time be deposited at the 
company’s office and this copy shall be made available for 
inspection by the shareholders until the end of the General 
Meeting.
Issue of shares
Shares are issued by a decision of the Management Board. 
This decision must be approved by the Supervisory Board. 
During the AGM held on 24 May 2017, our shareholders 
renewed the authority of the Management Board, subject to 
the Supervisory Board’s approval, to issue ordinary shares or 
to grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares up to and 
including 24 November 2018 for up to 10 percent of the total 
number of shares issued at the time of the General Meeting 
for any purposes. Any issuance exceeding this limit needs 
approval by the General Meeting.
In addition, the General Meeting renewed the authority of 
the Management Board, subject to the Supervisory Board’s 
approval, to restrict or exclude applicable pre-emptive 
rights when issuing ordinary shares or granting rights to 
subscribe for ordinary shares up to and including 
24 November 2018. 
At our next AGM scheduled to be held on 26 April 2018, the 
Management Board intends to request that the General 
Meeting renews its authorization to issue shares for up to 10 
percent of the total number of shares issued at the time of 
the AGM for any purposes.
Extraordinary General Meetings will be held if the 
Management Board or the Supervisory Board is requested to 
that effect in writing by one or more holders of shares (or 
holders of rights in rem (beperkte rechten) who also hold 
the voting rights in relation to those shares) individually or 
jointly representing 10 percent or more of the issued capital, 
specifying the details to be discussed. 
The company held no Extraordinary General Meetings in 
2017. Our next AGM is scheduled to be held on 26 April 2018 
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. More information is 
available on our website.
Voting rights
Each share carries one vote in the General Meeting. Subject 
to certain exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles 
of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are 
passed by an absolute majority of votes cast. Votes can be 
cast at the General Meeting either in person or by proxy. 
These proxies can be granted electronically or in writing to 
the company or to independent third parties, such as 
a civil-law notary.
Amendment to the Articles of Association
The General Meeting may pass a resolution to amend the 
Articles of Association or to wind up the company with an 
absolute majority of the votes cast. This can only be done if 
the Management Board has proposed to amend the articles 
or wind up the company. Such proposal has to be approved 
by the Supervisory Board.
When a proposal to amend the Articles of Association or to 
wind up the Company is made to the General Meeting, the 
intention to propose such resolution must be stated in the 
relevant notice convening the General Meeting. If it 
General Meetings can also be held as often as the 
Management Board or the Supervisory Board deem 
necessary. A General Meeting is also convened in case of 
a decision entailing a significant change in the identity or 
character of the company or its business. 
One or more shareholders representing at least the 
statutory threshold of three percent of the voting rights may 
request that the Management Board place items on the 
agenda of a General Meeting. Such a request must be 
honored by the Management Board provided that the 
request is received in writing at least 60 days before the date 
of such a meeting. 
Each shareholder is entitled – either in person or via proxy – 
to attend the General Meeting and to vote during the 
General Meeting. The General Meeting is the perfect place 
for shareholders and the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board to interact. At a General Meeting, 
shareholders can directly ask questions to the Management 
Board and/or Supervisory Board. Our Management Board 
and Supervisory Board highly encourage shareholders to 
interact. 
During the AGM held on 24 May 2017 in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands, shareholders voted in favor of adopting the 
annual accounts, determining the total dividend at €1.25 per 
share, discharging members of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board from liability, granting the authority to 
issue shares and the authority to restrict or exclude 
pre-emptive rights (see below for more detail), granting the 
authority to acquire own shares (see below) and reappointing 
EY as our auditor. The General Meeting and Management 
Board discussed the results, remuneration and governance 
of the company during the General Meeting.

company and a shareholders’ agreement (amongst each 
other).
As a result of the transaction completed on 20 February 
2017, Summit Partners no longer holds shares in the 
company and is no longer a party to the relationship 
agreement or the shareholders’ agreement. 
The relationship agreement is a Dutch law governed 
agreement that contains certain arrangements regarding 
the relationship between the parties thereto. The agreement 
currently grants each of Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak 
Investments B.V. a specific right to nominate or designate 
one Supervisory Board member for appointment (and 
replacement). This right expires, in respect of each relevant 
party, if such party ceases to, directly or indirectly, hold 
more than 5 percent of the shares in the company provided 
that and for as long as, in aggregate, Avalon Holding B.V. 
and Javak Investments B.V. together continue to, directly or 
indirectly, hold more than 5 percent of the company’s 
shares, Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. shall 
be entitled to jointly designate one Supervisory Board 
member for appointment. The relationship agreement also 
governs the composition of the Supervisory Board 
committees. The agreement terminates in respect of each 
of the shareholders, if such party’s aggregate shareholding 
in the company (be it direct, indirect or together with 
a permitted transferee) falls below 5 percent of the 
company’s outstanding share capital. In case of, among 
other things, the company becoming subject to insolvency 
procedures, liquidation, delisting, a merger or a spin-off 
(with the company as disappearing entity), the agreement 
automatically terminates.

must file or update its holdings if its interest exceeds, or 
drops below, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 
60%, 75% and 95%. For further detail on individual 
shareholdings please refer to the AFM’s register.

Relationship agreement and shareholders agreement
Avalon Holding B.V., Javak Investments B.V. and the 
combined entities advised by Summit Partners (Summit 
entities) entered into a relationship agreement with the 
Repurchase and purchase of Shares
Shares may be repurchased by the Company by a decision of 
the Management Board. This decision must be approved by 
the Supervisory Board. During the AGM held on 24 May 2017, 
our shareholders renewed the authority of the Management 
Board to, subject to the Supervisory Board’s approval, 
acquire shares in the capital of the Company, either through 
purchase on a stock exchange or otherwise. The authority 
applies up to and including 24 November 2018, under the 
following conditions: the repurchase (i) may constitute up to 
10 percent of the total number of shares issued at the time 
of the General Meeting; (ii) provided that the company will 
not hold more shares in stock than 10 percent of the issued 
share capital; and (iii) at a price (excluding expenses) not less 
than the nominal value of the shares and not higher than the 
opening price on Euronext Amsterdam on the day of 
repurchase plus 10 percent. Any repurchases exceeding 
these limits need approval by the General Meeting.
In order to align our employees’ interests with those of our 
shareholders, the company awarded 100 shares in the 
company to most employees with a tenure of over two 
years. The company purchased such shares under the 
authority granted by the General Meeting over the course of 
2017. 
At our next AGM scheduled to be held on 26 May 2018, the 
Management Board will request that the General Meeting 
renews its authorization to repurchase shares.

The following shareholders filed their interests in the capital 
of the company exceeding 3% to be included in the AFM’s

Board, the essence of its audit results to the Audit 
Committee and informs the external auditor. 
Management Board assesses the way in which the internal 
audit function fulfils its responsibility annually and takes the 
opinion of the Audit Committee into account.
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
The Corporate Governance Code defines a company as 
a long-term form of collaboration between the principal 
corporate bodies of a company. For us, these corporate 
bodies include the Management Board, the Supervisory 
Board and the General Meeting. The Management Board 
values and considers the interests of the various 
stakeholders involved. According to the Corporate 
Governance Code, good corporate governance results in 
effective decision-making in a manner which enhances 
shareholder value and enables a company to maintain 
a culture of integrity, transparency, and trust. The company 
has a long standing focus on a long-term value creation 
strategy, culture and risk. We acknowledge the importance 
of good corporate governance and endeavor to comply in 
general with the provisions of the Corporate Governance 
Code and comply fully with it, with the exception of the 
following provisions: 
◾
◾
Analyses carried out in respect of variable 
compensation 
Best practice provision 3.2.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code provides that the Remuneration and 
Appointment Committee should submit a proposal to 
the Supervisory Board concerning the remuneration of 
individual members of the Management Board. 
The proposal is drawn up in accordance with the 
remuneration policy that has been established and will, 
encourages an open culture within its organization and 
expects its employees to comply with applicable laws, 
regulations and internal policies. Each employee is 
responsible for ensuring an honest and ethical conduct of 
business within the company. Please refer to the chapter 
Flow Traders and Society for more details on our 
anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering 
policies, our Code of Conduct, our Whistle-blower Policy and 
Tax Principles.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit Function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and objective 
assurance, advice, and insight. An efficient and effective 
internal audit framework contributes to strong internal 
controls and to a robust corporate governance structure, 
which can address significant risks. The scope of internal 
audit work includes the examination and evaluation of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of Flow Traders’ risk 
management, control and governance processes as well as 
the quality of performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve Flow Traders’ stated goals and 
objectives. 
Our Group Internal Audit Charter defines the Internal Audit 
Function’s purpose, authority, responsibility and position 
within Flow Traders. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance provided  
by the Institute of Internal Auditors. 
The Internal Audit Function is an integral part of our 
reporting cycle. The Internal Audit Function reports to the 
Audit Committee and to the Co-CEO responsible for the 
Internal Audit Function. It aligns its efforts with the external 
auditor and reports its audit results to the Management 
Under the shareholders’ agreement governed by Dutch law, 
Avalon Holding B.V. and Javak Investments B.V. have agreed 
on certain arrangements in respect of their shareholding in 
the company. These arrangements include an obligation for 
each of the parties to vote in favor of the appointment of 
any individual designated by any of them as a member of the 
Supervisory Board in accordance with the terms of the 
relationship agreement (as described above). Furthermore, 
the parties agreed to reserve the right to consult with each 
other and coordinate the exercise of their voting rights 
attached to their respective shares in the company. 
The shareholders’ agreement terminates for any party if 
such party’s aggregate shareholding in the company (be it 
direct or indirect) falls below 3 percent of the company’s 
outstanding share capital and in case of, among other things, 
the company becoming subject to insolvency procedures, 
liquidation, delisting, a merger or spin-off (with the company 
as disappearing entity).
No dedicated take-over protection structures
Flow Traders does not employ any of the following 
dedicated take-over protection structures: preference 
shares, depositary receipts or call options issued to vehicles 
conducive to protecting the company’s interest or 
independence.
Compliance and integrity
Compliance and integrity
Flow Traders commits to being in compliance with all 
relevant laws and regulations that apply to it, anywhere, 
including in respect of tax and anti-corruption laws. Integrity 
and transparency is central to the way we operate our 
business, from our Management Board and Supervisory 
Board to all our staff, regardless of their role. The company

in any event, cover the remuneration structure, the 
amount of the fixed and variable remuneration 
components, the performance criteria used, the 
scenario analyses that are carried out and the pay ratios 
within the company and its affiliated enterprise. We do 
not fully comply with the scenario analyses that are 
carried out as the variable remuneration for the 
members of the Management Board is contingent upon 
a future, unknown, metric: the accrued firm-wide 
variable remuneration pool which itself depends on 
operating result for the given financial year. Because of 
the nature of our business activities and the fast paced 
industry in which we operate, the Supervisory Board 
tracks actual performance of the Management Board 
members and eligibility for variable compensation 
throughout the year, rather than performing a more 
hypothetical scenario analysis prior to a financial year 
while performing a single, one-off assessment at the 
end of the year as set out in the best practice 
provisions. Quarterly discussions take place between 
the Management Board members and the 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee for this 
purpose. In this manner the Supervisory Board regularly 
assesses the performance indicators and the potential 
resulting variable compensation for the Management 
Board members. Deviation from this provision is likely 
to continue until further notice.
◾
◾
Independence of Supervisory Board members 
Best practice provision 2.1.7 provides that any one of the 
criteria referred to in best practice provision 2.1.8 (i.-v.) 
should be applicable to at most one Supervisory Board 
member and that the total number of Supervisory 
Board members to whom the criteria referred to in best 
practice provision 2.1.8 are applicable should account 
for less than half of the total number of Supervisory

67
members of the Remuneration and Appointment 
Committee, implying that half (and not more than half) 
of its members are independent. Deviation from this 
provision is likely to continue until Roger Hodenius and 
Jan van Kuijk cease to be members of the Supervisory 
Board. 
◾
◾
Quorum 
Best practice provision 4.3.3 provides that the General 
Meeting of a company that is not subject to the 
statutory large company regime (structuurregime) may 
adopt a resolution to cancel the binding nature of a 
nomination for the appointment of a member of the 
Management Board or of the Supervisory Board and/or 
a resolution to remove a member of the Management 
Board or of the Supervisory Board by an absolute 
majority of the votes cast. According to the Corporate 
Governance Code, it may be provided that this majority 
should represent a given proportion of the issued 
capital, which proportion may not exceed one-third. 
If this proportion of the capital is not represented at the 
meeting, but an absolute majority of the votes cast is in 
favor of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of a 
nomination or to remove a board member, a new 
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may 
be passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
regardless of the proportion of the capital represented 
at the meeting.  
In deviation of this best practice provision, the 
company’s Articles of Association provide that the 
General Meeting may pass a resolution to cancel the 
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of 
a member of the Management Board or of the 
Supervisory Board and/or a resolution to remove a 
member of the Management Board or of the 
Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes 
company. Additionally, although Han Sikkens was a 
member of the board of Flow Traders Coöperatief U.A. 
(the company’s legal predecessor), this board 
functioned as a one-tier board. His role was  
comparable to that of a non-executive director. 
Therefore, according to legal analysis of the above 
elements, Han Sikkens does not qualify as a former 
board member by operation of best practice provision 
2.1.8 of the Corporate Governance Code. 
◾
◾
Independence of committee members 
As Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius do not qualify as 
independent Supervisory Board members as set out 
above, this also effects two Supervisory Board 
committees of which they are members. Best practice 
provision 2.3.4, provides that more than half of the 
members of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration and Appointment Committee should be 
independent. Both Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius are 
Board Members. Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius, as 
founders of the company, were attracted to their role 
as Supervisory Board members because of their specific 
business-related expertise. They do not qualify as 
independent under the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code as they are former members of the 
Management Board of the company prior to its 
conversion and because they represent shareholders of 
the company owning an interest of over 10 percent. 
Deviation from this provision is likely to continue until 
Roger Hodenius and Jan van Kuijk cease to be members 
of the Supervisory Board. 
Han Sikkens qualifies as an independent Supervisory 
Board member as of 20 February 2017. As of that date 
Summit Partners, represented by Han in the 
Supervisory Board, sold its stake in the company in full. 
Consequently, Han Sikkens no longer represents a 
shareholder with an interest of over 10 percent in the

cast, representing more than 50 percent of the 
company’s issued capital. In addition, the company’s 
Articles of Association provide that if this quorum is not 
present or represented at the meeting, such resolution 
cannot be adopted and in order for such a resolution to 
be adopted, a new meeting should be convened in 
which more than 50 percent of the company’s issued 
capital is represented and an absolute majority of the 
votes are cast in favor of such resolution.
◾
◾
Equal Opportunity Policy (Diversity Policy) 
Best practice provision 2.1.5 provides that the 
Supervisory Board should draw up a diversity policy for 
the composition of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board. The policy should address the 
concrete targets relating to diversity. Flow Traders 
deviates from best practice provision 2.1.5 as no 
concrete targets were set on diversity. However, the 
Supervisory Board has drawn up and adopted an Equal 
Opportunity Policy on 2 November 2017 that also 
addresses the diversity aspects of the composition of 
the Management Board and Supervisory Board. 
We believe that this policy also attains the purpose of 
best practice provision 2.1.5. In our view, the policy 
contributes to good governance, as it reflects our 
objective to treat everyone equally during the hiring 
process and throughout their careers at Flow Traders. 
Flow Traders is committed to being a truly equal 
opportunity employer, by recruiting, retaining and 
promoting people based on merit, and merit alone. 
The company is a firm believer in the benefits of a 
diverse workplace and does not make any concessions 
to quality. The objective is to provide equal 
employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants and equal career perspectives for all 
employees, provided they perform highly. 
When positions become available, Flow Traders actively 
encourages all candidates to apply and ensure that the 
selection and retention processes are truly equal for all 
applicants and employees. This also holds for the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. When it 
comes to diversity in the Supervisory Board and the 
Management Board, Flow Traders adheres to the same 
principle of equal opportunity as set out above. As a 
result, our current Supervisory Board is diverse in terms 
of, inter alia, age, education, nationality, and 
professional backgrounds.

Article 2:166 of the Dutch Civil Code states that the seats in 
the Management Board and the Supervisory Board should 
contain of at least 30 percent female and 30 percent male 
members. At Flow Traders, this is currently not the case. 
We believe in the drive to excel every day, and performing at 
the highest level possible, throughout all levels of our 
organization. To achieve this we seek to recruit, retain and 
promote the best talent, regardless of, inter alia, age, 
education, ethnicity, gender, nationality, professional 
background, religious faith or sexual orientation. 
Our selection is based on relevant education, professional 
experience and the competencies required. The persons 
fulfilling their roles in the Management respective 
Supervisory Board, are in our opinion the best fit for their 
roles. No Supervisory Board Members or Management 
Board Members were appointed or up for reappointment 
during financial year 2017.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1.	
Reporting entity
Flow Traders N.V. (referred to as the ‘Company’) is a public limited liability company (naamloze 
vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its seat (statutaire 
zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, having its registered office at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 
1018 LL Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Trade Register of the Chamber of 
Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, afdeling Handelsregister) under number 34294936.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is a leading global technology-enabled liquidity provider 
that specializes in exchange traded products (ETPs). The Group’s goal is to be a leading 
ETP-focused liquidity provider.
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the annual period ended 31 December 
2017 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders N.V., its subsidiaries and associates. 
The annual financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company’s Management 
Board and the Supervisory Board on 1 March 2018 subject to adoption by the General Meeting 
of shareholders.
2.	 Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption.
3.	 Basis of preparation 
a)	
Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (‘IFRS-EU’). IFRS-EU provides several options in accounting principles. The Group’s 
accounting principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding the options available are set out in 
the section ‘Significant accounting policies’ below.
b)	
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except 
for the following items and unless otherwise indicated:
◾
◾
financial assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with changes 
recognized in profit or loss; 
◾
◾
available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses which are 
recognized in profit or loss.
c)	
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the Group’s 
functional currency. All financial information presented in euros has been rounded to the 
nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
d)	
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to form opinions and make 
estimates and assumptions that influence the reported value of assets and liabilities and of 
income and expenditure. The actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are constantly assessed. Revisions of estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. For more details, we refer you to 
the chapter on Fair values of financial instruments.
e)	
Principles for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows
The consolidated statement of cash flows is based on the indirect method.
The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, including trading activities, investment 
activities and financing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of 
acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments other than in the course 
of operations, as well as acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property and 
equipment. Movements to the extent that those have not resulted in cash flows are eliminated.

4.	 Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
a)	
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group entities.
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from 
intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated 
against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee if it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date when control ceases. 
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.
Investments in associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or 
joint control, over its financial and operating activities. Control or significant influence follows 
from facts and circumstances, but there is a rebuttable presumption that significant influence 
when the Group holds between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting power of another 
entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized 
initially at cost. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, 
the carrying amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part 
thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair 
value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized 
in profit or loss.
b)	
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of the Group at 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the foreign currency 
difference recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising on the translation of available for 
sale equity investments are recognized in other comprehensive income unless the instrument 
is impaired.

Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
◾
◾
loans and receivables; 
◾
◾
investments held-to-maturity; 
◾
◾
available for sale investments; and
◾
◾
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and within the following category as:
◾
◾held for trading;
◾
◾designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan 
commitments, into the following categories:
◾
◾
financial liabilities held for trading; and
◾
◾
other financial liabilities.
Trading assets and liabilities
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group acquires or incurs 
principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of 
a portfolio that is managed together for short-term profit.
Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value in 
the statement of financial position, with transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. 
All changes in fair value are recognized as part of net trading income in profit or loss. 
Trading assets and liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except 
that non-derivative trading assets, other than those designated at fair value through profit or 
loss on initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at 
fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based 
on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. 
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euros at exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented in 
the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of equity. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, 
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclas-
sified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
c)	
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three 
months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
d)	
Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are originated. 
All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) 
are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or 
issue.

Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as 
available for sale or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. 
Available for sale financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly­
attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other 
than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available for sale debt 
instruments, are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value 
reserve in equity. When an investment is derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any directly  
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes 
a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of offset is agreed 
between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS-EU, 
for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading 
activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date in the 
principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at 
that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market 
for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the 
transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group 
determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the 
fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or 
liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, 
then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference 
between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, 
that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market 
data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group valuates its daily trading positions based on theoretical prices whereby the price 
differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those theoretical prices can differ 
from quoted market prices. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department monitors whether all 
differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the Group on the basis 
of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price 
that would be received to sell a net long position or paid to transfer a net short position for 
a particular risk exposure. Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the 
reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e)	
Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset.

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017
79
Goodwill in respect of equity-accounted investees is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-
accounted investee as a whole.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
g)	
Leased assets
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as financial leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount 
equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting 
policy applicable to that asset. 
Other leases are operating leases and are not recognized in the Group’s statement of financial 
position.
h)	
Impairment 
Non-derivative financial assets
A financial asset not classified as at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each 
reporting date for indications of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective 
evidence of a loss event which impacts the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or delinquency by 
a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not 
consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in 
the payment status of borrowers or issuers, or economic conditions that correlate with defaults 
or the disappearance of an active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an 
equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective 
evidence of impairment.
Impairment losses on available for sale financial assets are recognized by reclassifying the 
losses accumulated in the fair value reserve from equity to profit or loss. The loss that is reclas-
sified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any 
principal repayment and amortization, and the current fair value, less of impairment loss 
recognized previously in profit or loss.
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as the difference 
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognized in 
profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over 
the estimated useful lives of each component. Leased assets under financial leases are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant items of 
property and equipment are as follows:
◾
◾
hardware: 5 years;
◾
◾
office fixtures: 5 years;
◾
◾
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date 
and adjusted if appropriate. 
f)	
Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the estimated 
useful lives of each component. The estimated useful live of significant intangible assets is 
5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognized and in subsequent years measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.

i)	
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash variable 
compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
j)	
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognized as finance cost.
k)	
Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease as lease expenses.
l)	
Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial expenses 
related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and are therefore 
directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading income.
m)	 Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized 
in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items 
recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to 
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the 
recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is 
recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed 
reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU 
(group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no 
impairment loss had been recognized.

n)	
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognized at cost and 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue 
or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying 
amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in the share premium.
o)	
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental 
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs 
and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes 
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sale will be withdrawn. Management must be 
committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year 
from the date of the classification.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the 
statement of financial position.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either 
has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and is part of a single coordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
5.	 Operating segments
The Group has the following regions in which it operates via its subsidiaries in Europe (the 
Netherlands, Romania), the Americas (the United States of America) and Asia (Singapore and 
Hong Kong). 
tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any 
withholding tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not 
recognized for:
◾
◾
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss; 
◾
◾
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in the foreseeable future; and
◾
◾
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the 
impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. 
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based 
on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and management 
judgement. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause the Group to 
change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities or the collectability of 
tax assets. Such changes will impact tax expense in the period that such a change in estimate is 
made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis 
or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.

related to the trading position and is therefore short term by nature. The position as per 
31 December Is disclosed In note 14,15,22 and 23. Therefore IAS 7 does not have any impact on 
the financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized 
Losses
The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources 
of taxable profits against which it may make deductions on the reversal of deductible 
temporary difference related to unrealized losses. Furthermore, the amendments provide 
guidance on how an entity should determine future taxable profits and explain the circum-
stances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of some assets for more than their 
carrying amount. However, their application has no effect on the Group’s financial position and 
performance as the Group has no deductible temporary differences or assets that are in the 
scope of the amendments. 
IFRS 16 Leases 
The IASB issued the new standard for accounting for leases – IFRS 16 Leases –  in January 2016. 
The new standard does not significantly change the accounting for leases for lessors. However, 
it does require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, 
with the corresponding right of use assets. Lessees must apply a single model for all recognized 
leases, but will have the option not to recognize ‘short-term’ leases and leases of ‘low-value’ 
assets. Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern for recognized leases will be similar to 
today’s financial lease accounting, with interest and depreciation expense recognized 
separately in the statement of profit or loss. 
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is 
permitted provided the new revenue standard, IFRS 15, is applied on the same date. Lessees 
must adopt IFRS 16 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. 
The Group does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 16, as the amount of the operational leases 
outstanding are limited and in the short term the impact is expected to be immaterial.
Other new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.
6.	 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for 
annual periods beginning after 1 January 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements. Those that may be relevant to the Group are set out below. 
The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early.
The Group applied for the first time certain amendments to the standards, which are effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The Group has not early-adopted any 
standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.
The nature and the impact of each amendment is described below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for 
financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge 
accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early 
application permitted. 
Given the nature of the Group’s operations and the fact that the trading portfolio is valued at 
fair value through profit and loss, the impact on the Group’s financial statements is minimal.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when 
revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 
Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. 
IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, permitting 
early adoption. Given the nature of the Group’s operations the impact on the financial 
statements is minimal.
Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative
The amendments require entities to provide disclosure of changes in their liabilities arising from 
financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes (such 
as foreign exchange gains or losses). However, the financing position of the Group Is closely

associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable market prices and inputs 
varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific 
events and general conditions in the financial markets.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in determining appropriate portfolio-level 
adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask 
spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. Similarly, 
when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of 
net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, it takes into account any existing 
arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the 
counterparty).
Valuation framework
The Group has a control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. 
This framework includes a Risk and Mid-Office department which is independent of the Trading 
department and reports directly to the Management Board. The Risk and Mid-Office 
department has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading and all 
significant fair value measurements. The daily reconciliation of the positions and prices 
between the prime brokers and the Trading department is most important.
The prime brokers of the Group provide electronic position statements on a daily basis, which 
are uploaded automatically into the Group’s databases. The Group and its prime brokers agreed 
when files will be available and methods for transmission and communication. All data is 
normalized by the Group so it can be used in multiple internal systems. The information is 
mainly used for daily independent reconciliation of positions and prices, resulting in profit and 
loss accounts.
7.	 Fair values of financial instruments
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the 
following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in 
determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
Valuation models 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, depending on the 
inputs used for making the measurements.
◾
◾
Level 1: inputs that are quoted, unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical 
instruments;
◾
◾
Level 2: inputs, other than within Level 1, that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valuated using: 
quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical 
or similar instruments in markets that are considered inactive; or other valuation 
techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable market data; 
◾
◾
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the 
valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a significant effect on the 
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valuated based on 
quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or 
assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the 
price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly 
transaction between independent market participants at the measurement date.
The Group uses widely recognized valuation techniques and models (including net present 
value models and comparisons with similar instruments for which market observable prices 
exist) for determining the fair value of common, simple financial instruments that use only 
observable market data and require little management judgement and estimation. Observable 
prices or model inputs (including risk-free and benchmark interest rates and credit spreads 
used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, 
equity and equity index prices and expected price volatilities and correlations) are usually 
available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives and 
simple over-the-counter derivatives. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs 
reduces the need for management judgement and estimation and thus reduces the uncertainty

For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to determine fair 
value. 
b)	
Available for sale investments
The fair value of available for sale investments is determined by reference to their quoted 
closing bid price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique 
and are classified as Level 2.
c)	
Other receivables 
The carrying value of other receivables with a maturity of less than one year is assumed to 
approximate their fair values.

The following reconciliations are executed on a daily basis:
◾
◾
reconciliation of the positions - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles the 
positions of the Trading department with information provided by the prime brokers. 
All differences are reconciled and agreed by the Trading department of the Group and the 
prime brokers;
◾
◾
reconciliation of prices - The Risk and Mid-Office department reconciles prices as provided 
by the Trading Department with those of the prime brokers and/or data from external data 
vendors. All differences are reconciled and the Risk and Mid-Office department makes 
sure that any required follow up action is taken, either by the prime broker or the Trading 
department. Therefore, all prices are checked with independent sources.
Results of these reconciliation processes are communicated and agreed with Heads of Trading, 
the Risk and Mid-Office department and the Management Board on a daily basis.
a)	
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The Group mainly trades on regulated and active markets. The financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading are carried at fair value, based whenever possible on quoted market prices, 
as published by exchanges, market data vendors and prime brokers. 
The valuation of trading positions, both the long and the short positions, is determined by 
reference to last traded prices from similar instruments from the exchanges at the reporting 
date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are carried at fair value, 
based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted market prices. The theoretical prices 
reflect price adjustments primarily caused by the fact that the Group continuously prices its 
financial assets and liabilities based on all available information. This includes prices for 
identical and near-identical positions, as well as the prices for securities underlying the Group’s 
positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on which the financial asset or 
liability is traded closes. The Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department checks the theoretical 
price independently. As part of Its review, It monitors whether all price adjustments can be 
substantiated with market inputs. Consequently, such financial assets and liabilities are 
classified as Level 2.

8.	 Earnings per share
The calculation of the earnings per share has been based on the profit for the year attributable 
to ordinary shareholders and the number of ordinary shares outstanding. 
The treasury shares are still outstanding shares and therefore not deducted from the total 
number of shares outstanding when calculating the earnings per share.

The facilities are exclusively for the financing of positions of the financial instruments traded in 
the ordinary course of the trading activities using the various prime brokers.  
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin requirements 
(representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is variable and calculated on a daily 
basis depending on portfolio size and composition) in cash or securities as security for our 
positions held with the relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.

Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are guaranteed by the 
central counterparty or clearing house related to that exchange. Members of these clearing 
houses are required to deposit substantial amounts of cash, bonds or equities as guarantee for 
any failure to settlement of trading. 
The Group manages credit risk through its Risk and Mid-Office department that provide 
specific guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit risk. 
Policies include amongst others:
◾
◾
limits for individual product types;
◾
◾
limits per counterparty;
◾
◾
limits on the duration of the exposure;
◾
◾
limits for settlement types;
◾
◾
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty exposures are 
monitored on an intra-day basis. 
During 2017, the Group observed no significant concentration of credit risks towards single­
counterparties and geographically there was no concentration of credit risk. 
Based on the Group’s counterparty credit risk monitoring, the Group believes that no 
impairment is necessary in respect of trading and other receivables.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial liabilities that:
◾
◾
are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
◾
◾
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that 
covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase 
agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. Similar financial instruments 
include derivatives, sales and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase 
agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, 
Significant restrictions
The Group does not have significant restrictions on its ability to access or use its assets and 
settle its liabilities other than those resulting from the supervisory frameworks within which its 
subsidiaries operate. Please refer to the Capital Management section of this report for more 
information.
31.	 Financial risk management
Overview
The Group is exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
◾
◾
credit risk;
◾
◾
market risk;
◾
◾
liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the 
Group’s management of capital.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the settlement of 
off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. These amounts 
significantly exceed expected loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes 
into account the likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can receive and grant 
collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in respect of the following 
transactions:
◾
◾
derivatives;
◾
◾
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
◾
◾
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in 
respect of derivatives (including swaps). Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms 
including, where appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities 
received/granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction, 
but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each party the right 
to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure to post collateral.
The following tables reconcile the ‘Gross amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities 
presented in the statement of financial position’, as set out above, to the line items presented 
in the statement of financial position.
such as loans and deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the 
statement of financial position. This is because they create a right to offset recognized 
amounts for the parties to the agreement that is enforceable only following an event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties or following other 
predetermined events. In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on 
a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize the risk for market movements and 
does not engage in long and/or short only positions. The direction of market movements, i.e. 
what the Group considers directional market risk, is not relevant for the Group because of this 
long/short trading strategy. Because of the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed. 
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and 
settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are captured in the risk 
and margin requirements which the Group has to post at its prime brokers and clearing firms. 
The consolidated margin and haircut requirements over 2017 is shown in the Capital 
management paragraph. The haircut set out in the graph below reflects the mandatory capital 
requirement of the prime brokers. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk 
close to zero remains as a result of inefficiencies in the models of the prime brokers. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the euro, but also 
United States dollars and Singapore dollars. 
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well as net results 
of these foreign operations during the year.

Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial instrument 
fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited to, such as interest rates, 
volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and equity prices. The Risk and 
Mid-Office department monitors market risk exposure on a continuous basis (including 
intraday). Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated risk for the Group, limit 
breaches, if any, will trigger action from the Risk and Mid-Office department in order to reduce 
the risk. 
In addition to the Group’s Risk and Mid-Office department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily. The applicable haircut and margins are computed by the Group’s prime 
brokers. The Risk and Mid-Office department computes the haircut using internal models 
enabling intra-day monitoring. Limits are set on both capital- and credit usage.
Long and short trading positions include securities and derivatives such as: shares, American 
depositary receipts (ADRs), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRAs), 
and exchange-traded products (ETP). All traded financial instruments are liquid instruments. 
Therefore, the portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame and with limited 
costs.

trations, pricing and valuation parameters and natural hedging between these long and short 
positions.
As the Group is active in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in 
underlying values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero. 
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and margins are computed 
by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis measures all positions, individual and 
correlated, and reflects the different risk components. The third party haircut calculation 
confirms the internal assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is 
exposed to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under Market risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime brokers, 
is monitored on a daily basis.
Maturity based on contractual undiscounted cash flows is as follows:

The Group manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency. 
The Group does not use financial instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net 
investments in foreign operations or net results of foreign operations.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial instruments. The Group 
is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches of arranged interest rates of assets 
and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These 
limits ensure that interest rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and 
hedging strategies used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. 
All financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair value on 
the balance sheet. The Group is engaged in high velocity liquidity provision and therefore all 
positions held on the balance sheet are short term and, in addition, are all listed on exchanges 
and therefore liquid and tradable. 
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility available to 
facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the balance sheet. In order to match the 
liquidity and short holding period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate 
payable, which is floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact 
that the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short positions and 
in the EFP of the future. 
Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as the Group’s 
investments in available for sale securities. In addition, for its option positions, the implied 
volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk factor. Other factors to consider are 
time and dividend expectations. 
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual positions per 
product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the size of the exposure, concen-

Liquidity and capital resources
Beside equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the prime brokers 
through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well as cash generated from our 
operating activities. As of 31 December 2017, the Group held € 5,9 million in cash and cash 
equivalents compared to € 2.7 million as of 31 December 2016. These balances are maintained 
primarily to support operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient 
short-term access to liquidity, and capital expenditures. .

Capital management
The Management Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base well above the required 
margins in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Management Board monitors the return on its capital as well 
as the level of dividends to its shareholders.
The Group is prudentially supervised by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, DNB). 
In addition, as its Dutch trading subsidiary is a registered investment firm dealing on its own 
account in its capacity of market maker, the Group is subject to the rules and regulations of the 
Dutch Financial Services Act (Wet op het Financieel Toezicht) and, as a member of various 
venues, the Group is also subject to rules and regulations of the exchanges. 
If a firm fails to maintain the required capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation or 
registration by the applicable regulatory agency, and suspension or expulsion by these 
regulators could ultimately lead to the Group’s liquidation. Additionally, these rules may have 
the effect of prohibiting a proprietary trading firm from distributing or withdrawing capital and 
requiring prior notice to and approval from DNB for certain capital withdrawals. 
The available capital in the trading companies is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that 
requirements are met at all times and sufficient capital is available to support the Group’s 
strategy.
During 2017, the Group’s capital was above the regulatory minimum requirements.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
Capital requirements 
The Group’s regulators and prime brokers require certain levels of capital, which are managed 
by the Group in order to maintain net liquidity (which represents the value of our trading 
positions, principally long and short positions in equity securities, plus cash and cash 
equivalents) in excess of our various capital requirements at all times.

As shown in the graphs above under Market risks, during 2017 all prime broker minimum capital

Regulatory capital requirements
The Company and our subsidiary Flow Traders B.V. are subject to separate regulatory capital 
requirements in the Netherlands and our subsidiary Flow Traders U.S. LLC is subject to 
regulatory capital requirements in the United States. Flow Traders Asia Pte. Ltd. is exempt from 
regulatory capital requirements.
Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements could result in sanctions, including 
citations, fines, limits to our trading and revocation of a regulatory license.
Dutch regulatory capital requirements 
The regulatory capital requirement prescribed by the Dutch Central Bank in respect of Flow 
Traders B.V. and the Company is deemed to be satisfied if the regulatory capital of Flow Traders 
B.V. and the Company is at least equal to their last reviewed or audited equity by our external 
auditor. The following table sets forth regulatory capital, regulatory capital requirements and 
excess regulatory capital for Flow Traders B.V. and our Group as reported in regulatory filings as 
of the dates indicated:
Prime broker capital requirements 
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain certain minimum capital levels. Prime brokers 
use different internal systems to calculate required capital amounts (e.g., the so-called 
‘internal haircut model’ and the so-called ‘margin based approach model’, both intending to 
ensure sufficient levels of risk allowances) and have different limits structure, pre-funding 
possibilities and cut-off times for wiring capital. The aggregate capital that is required to 
maintain by the prime brokers is significantly in excess of the actual risk exposure, principally 
due to (i) the offsetting legs of a transaction sometimes being cleared through different prime 
brokers and therefore each leg requiring a margin to be posted separately and therefore no 
offsets are applicable across prime brokers, irrespective of the overall risk exposure to our 
business and (ii) margin requirements of its prime brokers being affected by the sophistication 
of their models (which might not correspond to our models) and the regulatory requirements 
applicable to them.

Subsequent events
No material subsequent events have occurred since 31 December 2017 that require recognition 
or disclosure in this year’s financial statements.
The company announced signing of a Share Purchase Agreement on 19 January 2018 on the sale 
of the 24% stake in Think ETF Asset Management B.V.. The closing of this deal is subject to

In November 2017 the Dutch Central Bank informed Flow Traders to amend the capital 
requirements for investment firms dealing on their own account. Starting 31 March 2018 Flow 
Traders is required to meet the regulatory requirement of the EU Capital Requirement 
Regulation (CRR). After detailed assessment Flow Traders has implemented the requirements 
applicable and expects to comply with these Capital Requirements as from 31 March 2018 
onwards.
U.S. regulatory capital requirements 
The SEC and FINRA impose rules on Flow Traders U.S. LLC, as a registered U.S. broker-dealer, 
that require notification when regulatory capital levels fall below certain pre-defined criteria. 
These rules also dictate the ratio of debt-to-equity in Flow Traders U.S. LLC’s regulatory capital 
composition and constrain its ability to expand its business under certain circumstances. These 
regulations also prohibit repaying subordinated borrowings, paying cash dividends, making 
loans to the firm’s parent, affiliates or employees, or otherwise entering into transactions which 
would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than 120% of its required minimum 
capital. Moreover, Flow Traders U.S. LLC is required to notify the SEC, FINRA and other 
regulators prior to repaying subordinated borrowings, paying dividends and making loans to its 
parent, affiliates or employees, or otherwise entering into transactions, which, if executed, 
would result in a reduction of 30% or more of its excess net capital (net capital less minimum 
requirement).

Notes to the parent company financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euros, unless stated otherwise.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the determination  
of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and 
determination of the result for its parent Company financial statements, the Group applies the 
option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the 
recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result 
(hereinafter referred to as principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent company 
financial statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS-EU financial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has significant influence, 
are measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated statements chapter 1 to 4 for 
a description of the Group’s IFRS-EU principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Group’s share in the results of these 
participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the transfer of assets and liabilities 
between (i) the Group and its participating interests on (ii) between participating interests 
themselves, are not recognized.

The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements.
In our opinion: 
◾
◾
The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
financial position of Flow Traders N.V. as at 31 December 2017, and of its result and its cash 
flows for 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
◾

The consolidated financial statements comprise:

◾

◾

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsi-
bilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report.
We are independent of Flow Traders N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht account-
antsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankeli-
jkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence 
regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- 
en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. 
MATERIALITY
Materiality
€ 2,4 million (2016: €5 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of pre-tax income (rounded)
Explanation
We applied pre-tax income as this benchmark is an 
important metric for the users of the financial statements 
of Flow Traders N.V.
We have also taken misstatements into account and/or possible misstatements that in our 
opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of € 120 thousand, which 
are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.

Our key audit matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most  
significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit 
matter to the supervisory board. The key audit matter is not a comprehensive reflection of all 
matters discussed. 
This key audit matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this 
matters. In comparison, last year revenue recognition and reliability and continuity of IT were 
also identified as key audit matter. The revenues and cash positions could however be 
reconciled to external party confirmations and no unusual or unexpected transactions were 
executed during the year. On the basis of our procedures over the IT environment we have no 
indication that any significant audit risk exists within the area this year. Therefore, these 
subjects are no longer noted as key audit matter. 
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders N.V. Amsterdam is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of 
this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Flow Traders N.V. 
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities Flow Traders B.V. and Flow Traders 
U.S. LLC based on the relative size of these components. 
We have:
◾
◾
Performed audit procedures ourselves at group entity Flow Traders B.V.
◾
◾
Used the work of other auditors when auditing entity Flow Traders U.S. LLC
◾
◾
Performed specific audit procedures at other group entities
By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional 
procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit 
evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated 
financial statements.
Risk
Our audit approach
Key Observation
Fair value measurement of financial instruments  
(note 7 of the financial statements)
Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of financial 
instruments is based on internally determined theoretical 
prices, which are also used for quoting purposes. As such, 
valuation can be different than the closing prices at the 
various stock exchanges, for example due to market 
illiquidity and the opening hours of the stock exchanges.
The fair values recorded could include estimates and could 
be biased. Therefore, we have identified the valuation of 
financial instruments as a significant risk within our audit.
We obtained an understanding of the valuation process, 
including verifications done by the risk and middle office 
department. We performed sample testing on the valuation 
of individual positions by comparing the internally developed 
prices to external sources. 
We evaluated the fair value hierarchy of financial 
instruments and developments therein since prior year. 
Furthermore, we inspected the financial statements for 
compliance and consistency with IFRS 13 on disclosure 
requirements for financial instruments.
The method of fair value measurement and the underlying 
input for valuation of the financial trading assets and 
liabilities is reasonable. The fair value hierarchy and the 
classification of the financial instruments is reasonable. 
Finally, we believe the disclosure of the financial instruments 
in the financial statements is appropriate.

FLOW TRADERS  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2017 113
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V. on 19 May 2016, as of 
the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor since that date.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU 
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.
Description of responsibilities for the financial statements
Responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing 
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting 
frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose 
events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in the financial statements. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. 
Report on other information included in the annual report
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report 
contains other information that consists of:
◾
◾
The management board’s report
◾
◾
Other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
◾
◾
Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements
◾
◾
Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained 
through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the 
other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, 
we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch 
Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is less than the scope of those 
performed in our audit of the financial statements.
Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the 
management board’s report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and 
other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

◾
◾
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, 
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and 
extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/
or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities 
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information 
or specific items.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional 
report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in 
this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circum-
stances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.
The Hague, 1 March 2018
Ernst & Young Accountants LLP
Signed by T. de Kuijper
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means 
we may not have detected all material errors and fraud. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on 
our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism 
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements 
and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.,: 
◾
◾
Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control
◾
◾
Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
◾
◾
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management
◾
◾
Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as 
a going concern
◾
◾
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures
