Interview with the CEO
 How do you reflect on 2023?
Despite the subdued market environment, 2023 
provided us with many proof points that confirmed 
the viability of our communicated strategy to 
achieve our growth and diversification objectives. 
Throughout the year, we further refined our strategy 
and strengthened our trading capabilities to deliver 
seamless execution to our growing network of 
trusted counterparties and to provide liquidity in all 
market environments. Focusing on Flow Traders’ 
financial performance, despite a muted year in terms 
of trading volumes and volatility, we recorded a Net 
Trading Income of €300.3 million (Normalized Net 
Trading Income of €300.3 million) and a Net Profit of 
€36.2 milion (Normalized Net Profit of €59.4 million). 
Our capital position remained strong and enabled us 
to deploy trading capital effectively across all 
regions and asset classes to maximize trading 
opportunities that arose throughout the year. In 
2023, we continued to expand geographically with a 
new location established in Chicago and we further 
bolstered our presence in China, where we grew our 
local partnerships.
Regarding our global leadership team, we welcomed 
Hermien Smeets-Flier to the team in July of last year 
and her appointment as Chief Financial Officer and 
an Executive Director of the Flow Traders Ltd. Board 
was confirmed by our shareholders in September. In 
August, following a 17-year tenure with the firm, 
Folkert Joling, Chief Trading Officer, decided to 
leave the organization. As part of the transition, our 
Global Executive Committee members representing 
Trading & Technology assumed Folkert’s 
responsibilities. On behalf of our entire firm, I would 
like to extend our gratitude to Folkert for his 
significant contributions to developing the firm and 
the trading function during his time with us.
 What are your 2023 highlights?
I am incredibly proud of what our global team was 
able to deliver during a challenging year in terms of 
market circumstances. Our team remained fully 
committed and demonstrated extraordinary 
resilience throughout the year. Our global teams are 
the key ingredient for our firm and our growth in the 
coming years. 
Diving into our business, in equities, we focused on 
harnessing our trading capabilities to explore 
adjacent products, successfully launching ADRs in 
the Americas. In Fixed Income we made structural 
progress and further capitalized on the 
electronification trend to scale our algo trading 
strategies. In digital assets we expanded our market 
making proposition and built connectivity to 
leverage the emerging opportunities within this 
asset class.
In 2023, we also strengthened our geographical 
footprint by expanding our operations in China, 
opening a new office in Chicago and successfully 
obtaining our Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
license in the UK. In December, we announced 
AllUnity, a partnership with industry leaders Galaxy 
Digital and DWS Asset Management. AllUnity will 
launch a Euro-denominated stablecoin and aims to 
accelerate the mass market adoption of digital 
assets. This partnership further cements our goal of 
increasing our proximity to emerging innovation 
within the digital assets space and leverages our 
strategic investments. Throughout the year, we also 
increased our focus on enhancing our governance 
layer, control functions and risk framework to 
uphold the highest standards and principles across 
all our operating entities. Furthermore, we 
maintained ongoing dialogues with our stakeholders 
including shareholders and regulators to continue to 
build our business.

 2023 was your first year as CEO, what are 
your observations?
Even though 2023 presented its challenges with 
below average market volatility and volumes, we 
took the opportunity to concentrate on our growth 
and diversification plans as well as further 
developing our trading capabilities as a global 
trading firm. Given our focus on scaling our business 
globally, we put a specific importance on our 
operating model to identify and drive operational 
efficiencies, alongside fostering our growth 
initiatives.
I remain excited about the unique prospects of our 
firm and the attractiveness of our medium- and 
long-term opportunities. There is a clear need in 
financial markets for liquidity provisioning, market 
making, and innovation, specifically at a time when 
we have seen and will further see impactful 
structural changes in global financial markets.
From a personal perspective, I feel privileged to be 
part of this team and to lead the firm alongside our 
global leadership team, knowing that the key to 
success is continued dedication to our business and 
challenging the status quo. Since joining the firm 
two years ago and being the CEO for the past year, 
this statement is truly something that resonates with 
me and continues to ignite my passion for this firm.
 What are your key 2024 priorities?
The continuous inflow of funds into ETP assets 
around the world expands the opportunities to grow 
our core business, while the structural industry shifts 
towards electronification, digitization, and 
regulatory evolution plays to our strengths. We will 
concentrate on strengthening this core part of our 
business and further develop our relationships with 
leading issuers, exchanges, and counterparties.
Given our role within the intricate global financial 
market ecosystem, we are also uniquely positioned 
to have a holistic view on the trends influencing 
market participants and how they transact today. 
Through our strategic partnerships, we can provide 
an invaluable perspective on how technology and 
innovation are driving tangible changes to 
fundamentally improve the efficiency of financial 
markets. Our technology strategy also plays a key 
role in this and continues to adapt to the evolving 
financial markets to serve retail and institutional 
investors in the future.
The accelerating global adoption of digital assets by 
institutions and our position as a player in both the 
traditional centralized and newly emerging 
decentralized finance ecosystems present a 
multitude of growth prospects for Flow Traders. In 
2023, the introduction of MiCAR, which provides a 
holistic regulatory framework for digital assets, 
positioned Europe at the forefront of the developing 
digital asset space and unlocked the potential of this 
emerging asset class. This regulation will also 
directly benefit AllUnity. Meanwhile, the approval 
and launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. also 
began a new phase in the maturity and adoption of 
digital assets in the world’s largest economy. 
We will also celebrate a significant milestone in 2024 
as we mark our 20-year anniversary. Twenty years in 
the making, our culture is still unique, highly 
entrepreneurial, and energetic. This is an incredible 
achievement, and we look forward to continuing to 
grow the business, collaborate with our partners, 
and drive changes in global financial markets. As a 
firm, we believe we have the right components and 
strategy in place to deliver in 2024. We have 
established a strong leadership layer, created 
concrete plans to support the growth of our 
business across regions and asset classes, and are 
equipped to make 2024 one of the best years in our 
firm’s rich history. We will continue to strive to bring 
greater transparency and efficiency to the markets 
and value to the financial ecosystem and our 
stakeholders for many years to come, which 
tremendously excites me and everyone else in our 
firm.

Markets and trends
Our business
Flow Traders operates three main trading hubs in 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and New York. In addition, 
we operate branch and representative offices in 
Chicago, Cluj, London, Milan, Paris, Shanghai, and 
Singapore.
In 2023 we had access to more than 180 trading 
venues in 40 countries around the world. We 
provided liquidity in over 6,500 unique ETP ISIN’s 
on- and off-exchange, which is more than 40 
percent of all ETPs globally. Off-exchange, we 
provide liquidity in ETPs on a request-for-quote 
basis to more than 2,400 institutional counterparties 
across the globe, including banks, asset managers, 
pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, 
hedge funds, and others and this number is 
increasing on an almost daily basis. In addition to 
ETPs we provide liquidity in similar instruments 
whose value is correspondingly affected by a change 
in the value of underlying or related assets, such as 
futures or bonds. During 2023, we continued to 
implement our diversification, strategy and related 
initiatives across other asset classes and provided 
liquidity as a market maker in FX, fixed income, 
commodities and cryptocurrency.
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider 
we generally do not have a directional opinion on 
the market. In other words, our results do not 
depend on the direction of market prices. Our net 
trading income is derived from the small price 
differences that are realized between buying and 
selling related or correlated assets. Whether that is 
between the ETPs we buy or sell, the prices we pay 
or receive for the underlying related financial 
instruments to mitigate our risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager 
and do not have client Assets under Management 
(AuM), as we trade from our own capital. We also do 
not develop or make products, do not provide any 
services and do not have (consumer) clients. Our 
value chain comprises, among others, of our 
institutional counterparties, prime brokers and 
regulators. 
ETP market
In recent years, the ETP ecosystem has continued to 
mature and experience significant growth in both 
Assets under Management (AuM) and number of 
products. According to ETFGI, global ETP AuM 
increased from €8,143 billion at the end of 2022 to 
€10,813 billion at the end of 2023. This is a reflection 
mainly of the underlying market performance during 
2023 coupled with continued inflows into ETPs. The 
market expectation is that AuM will continue to 
grow going forward and we believe there are a 
number of reasons for this. One is that investors are 
attracted to the transparent nature of ETPs, which 
enables them to clearly follow how the underlying 
securities are performing. Another reason is that 
ETPs are liquid, available at lower costs and can be 
bought and sold easily during market hours. A third 
reason is that ETPs can be composed of financial 
instruments from almost any asset class, sector or 
location, providing investors access to markets that 
would normally be difficult to reach.
Global ETP markets grew by 33% in 2023, as 
measured by AuM, driven predominantly by the 
outperformance of the underlying markets. Annual 
global inflows of ETP AuM were €901 billion in 2023 
(2022: €818 billion – source ETFGI). Overall trading 
activity in 2023 declined compared to the prior year 
given the heightened market activity in 2022 as a 
result of the conflict in Eastern Europe, rising 
inflation, interest rate increases by central banks, 
and high levels of retail investor activity in the US.
Global coverage
In 2023, Flow Traders’ ETP value traded once again 
was in excess of the €1 trillion mark. The EMEA ETP 
market recorded total ETP value traded of €2.0 
trillion in 2023. Flow Traders' total ETP value traded 
in EMEA was €617 billion in 2023. We remained a 
leading liquidity provider in ETPs in the region and 
managed to grow our on- and off-exchange trading 
capabilities further. The largest ETP market globally 
remains in the Americas, where total ETP value 
traded (on- and off-exchange) was €35.9 trillion in 
2023. Flow Traders' ETP value traded in the Americas 
was €753 billion in 2023, markedly lower than in 
2022 given the subdued market environment. 
Institutional trading continued to expand in 2023 
and Flow Traders Americas continued to grow and 
deepen its overall presence in this important market. 
We also expanded our Lead Market Maker activities 
during 2023 and supported numerous ETF listings in 
the US for a variety of leading issuers. Our strategic 
investment in Members Exchange (MEMX) 
underlines our long-term commitment to the US 
equities ecosystem as we seek to grow our business 
and presence further. 
In APAC, the ETP market remain fragmented, with 
large differences in trading volumes, trading costs, 
regulation and maturity across the financial markets. 
The APAC ETP market recorded total ETP value 
traded of €5.2 trillion in 2023, including China, while 
Flow Traders' total ETP value traded was €93.0 
billion. Flow Traders had a successful year in 2023 in 
APAC following the receipt of our own QFII license in

China, confirming our strategy of recent investments 
made in the region. 
Equity
We still see significant opportunities for growth in 
the equity ETP market, which is the main focus of 
the Equity business at Flow Traders. Global equity 
ETP value traded decreased to €23,372 billion in 
2023 and further market growth is expected from 
the increasing investor demand and awareness for 
the product. Flow Traders' Equity value traded (ETPs, 
Futures and Cash) amounted to €3,009 billion in 
2023.
Flow Traders' strengths and future focus relating to 
Equity include:
▪
Strong performance globally in International ETPs 
and Index Futures.
▪
Leveraging our global pricing capabilities in APAC 
as we penetrate and unlock new growth markets.
Fixed Income
Electronic trading in Fixed Income has increased 
dramatically over the last few years. For example, 
50% of Euro-denominated investment-grade (IG) 
credit is now executed electronically, reaching 75% 
on a ticket-count basis. This increase has 
contributed to the approaching inflection point in 
the electronification of credit markets. This is similar 
to what we have witnessed in other asset classes, 
such as foreign exchange (FX), US equity options and 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This transition is 
being driven by better pre- and post-trade 
information, the rise of algorithmic trading and new 
trading protocols being embraced by the buy- and 
sell-side. Initially driven by regulation such as MiFID 
II, it is likely that the regulatory landscape will 
continue to accelerate this electronification trend. 
Responding to these market dynamics, Flow Traders 
has built a strong fixed income liquidity provision 
capability set spanning ETPs, corporate credit 
(investment-grade and high yield bonds) and 
emerging market sovereigns. 
There has been a consistent increase in fixed income 
ETP value traded in recent years as well as AuM. 
Global Fixed Income ETP value traded increased to 
€3 trillion in 2023. Flow Traders Fixed Income value 
traded (ETPs, Futures and Cash) amounted to €1,154 
billion in 2023, a decline from 2022's €1,323 billion) 
given the heightened volatility in the fixed income 
market last year. Nevertheless, we continue to 
deepen and broaden our market coverage and our 
offerings continue to gain traction with our buy-side 
counterparties.
From a strategic standpoint, Flow Traders' focus 
areas include:
▪
ETP ecosystem - partner with issuers to develop 
innovative fixed income products. We are also 
seeking creation-redemption synergies with 
corporate bond market making.
▪
Credit trading - will increase quote sizes to 
undertake larger block transactions with 
counterparties as well as distributing pre-trade 
portfolio trading levels to expedite portfolio 
construction.
▪
Model pricing - expand model trading capabilities 
to new fixed income subsets and improve pricing 
and coverage of investment-grade bonds.
Currency, Cryptocurrency and Commodity 
(CCC)
In recent years, cryptocurrencies has emerged as an 
important asset class with increased institutional 
acceptance. The value of cryptocurrencies bounced 
back in 2023 after a significant decline in 2022. 
However, trading volumes and volatility declined 
50-60% year-on-year in 2023 compared to 2022, 
resulting in a subdued trading environment. The 
development of institutional grade and regulated 
digital asset market infrastructure continued to 
progress in 2023. This comes on top of continued 
growth in custody solutions, prime brokerage, data 
and analytics, AML-KYC and other risk solutions, 
digital property rights, digital identity solutions as 
well as decentralized finance ecosystems. 
Crypto ETPs are another clear example of regulatory 
and investor acceptance of digital assets, with major 
ETP issuers applying to regulators for permission to 
create spot Bitcoin ETFs. They solve liquidity and 
custody issues many investors, both retail and 
institutional, face by having an exchange-listed 
instrument with registered market makers providing 
liquidity under all market circumstances. 
Flow Traders’ Crypto liquidity provision commenced 
more than seven years ago and spans OTC spot as 
well as ETPs. We are connected to over 20 trading 
venues globally and provide liquidity to over 200 
cryptocurrencies. From an ETP perspective, Flow 
Traders is the number 1 liquidity provider in Crypto 
ETPs in Europe and a leader globally on-exchange. 
The digital assets space is well-suited to Flow 
Traders’ technology-enabled capabilities.
The future focus and opportunities for digital assets 
include:

ETPs - maintain our leading position in Crypto 
ETP market making with the prospect of further

market making activities across these products 
by expanding our platform and token coverage.

than double by 2030 from 2023.

fixed income and other asset classes.
▪
Growth in digital assets and institutional adoption 
as well as development of large new liquidity 
pools.
▪
Emerging ecosystems adapting to shifting trends 
and driving venture capital and private equity 
investments.
▪
Ever evolving regulatory landscape which creates 
greater transparency and a more level playing 
field.
The markets’ core functions remain the same: 
transferring risk between various market 
participants. This is where we add value. 
Accordingly, our focus will continue to be on 
providing liquidity in more products in the financial 
markets across multiple asset classes, building on 
our status as an leading ETP trading firm. We are also 
seeking to be a driver and accelerator of innovation 
within financial markets through our dedicated 
corporate venture capital unit, Flow Traders 
Strategic Capital.
Our business principles
Our business principles are about being flexible, 
agile and focused on continuous improvements. To 
be successful, we recognize that we need to 
perform well across all areas of the business. 
Achieving this involves diligently studying the 
markets and our responses to them, and using our 
resources where they have the greatest impact. The 
outcome of this process defines whether or not we 
have a competitive edge.
Our business strategy 
We will achieve our strategic ambition by continuing 
to grow our business through our dedicated multi-
year diversification strategy. Here we have 
expanded, and will continue to expand, on our 
leading market position in ETPs with growth in fixed 
income, digital assets, FX, and commodities. This 
should result in structurally growing our Net Trading 
Income (NTI), while increasing the resilience of the 
business and also maintaining our desired risk 
profile, controlling costs, and securing and attracting 
the right talent.

Growing our NTI involves increasing the volumes we 
trade and the net margins we capture per trade, 
where volume is the value of products we trade, and 
the net margin is the margin we capture per trade 
after all associated hedging and trading costs. Our 
risk profile is characterized by having no directional 
opinion on the market. In other words, our results do 
not depend on the direction of market prices. By 
expanding our presence as a liquidity provider 
across multiple asset classes, Flow Traders can 
maximize the growth of its NTI. 
By expanding our presence in the underlying asset 
classes, we expect to improve our performance in 
the future, including during those periods of 
decreased trading activity. Our investments through 
Flow Traders Strategic Capital are expected to not 
only generate a financial return but also drive 
strategic expansion as we foster innovation across 
the global financial markets.
Be a leading global multi-asset liquidity 
provider
We believe there are six elements of our strategic 
ambition which will drive Flow Traders in its goal to 
becoming a leading global multi-asset liquidity 
provider:
▪
Global access - providing liquidity any time 
anywhere across trading venues, exchanges and 
to institutional counterparties.
▪
Asset universe - trading a variety of assets to 
expand our presence in ETPs and grow in the 
underlying asset classes.
▪
Pricing excellence - acting as a market neutral 
provider 24/5 with strong hedging capabilities in 
all asset classes.
▪
Proprietary cutting edge technology - benefiting 
from automated, low-touch trading 
infrastructure for seamless execution.
▪
Talented team - leveraging an experienced talent 
pool that forms an open, diverse and 
entrepreneurial team.
▪
Ecosystem innovation - shaping financial markets 
through strategic investments and partnerships 
with leading players.

Financial overview
Flow Traders delivered financial and trading 
performance in 2023 reflecting a more 
subdued market environment. We recorded 
Total Income in 2023 of €303.9 million 
(2022: €458.7 million). Operational 
highlights included the broadening of our 
ETP trading footprint and continued 
development of our trading infrastructure, 
connectivity and counterparty network. 
Within digital assets, we saw an increased 
appetite especially considering the much-
anticipated Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC, 
a milestone for the development of the 
asset class. In terms of our capital position, 
it remains strong despite of a challenging 
2023 and looking ahead, we have cemented 
our plans and governance to capitalize on 
future opportunities.
Financial overview 
Market environment
The market environment in 2023 was much more 
subdued compared to 2022 given the heightened 
market activity in the prior year as the increase in 
inflation and central bank interest rates around the 
world slowed throughout the year while the conflict 
in Eastern Europe entered its second year. Volatility, 
as measured by the VIX index, was on average much 
lower in 2023 at 16.07 (2022: 25.98). 
Given this market backdrop, Flow Traders' total 
value traded declined to €5.6 trillion in 2023 (2022: 
€6.8 trillion); of which €1.5 trillion was traded in on- 
and off-exchange ETPs (2022: €1.8 trillion), with the 
remainder in related financial products used to 
facilitate trading in ETPs and other asset classes 
such as fixed income, FX and cryptocurrency. 
Likewise, on- and off-exchange ETP market value 
traded also decreased during the same period to 
€43.1 trillion (2022: €51.8 trillion).
Total income
Total income was €303.9 million in 2023, (2022: 
€458.7 million), comprised of Net Trading Income 
(NTI) of €300.3 million (2022: €460.2 million) and 
€3.6 million of other income primarily from 
unrealized gains in our strategic investments (2022:
€1.5 million). Europe, our home market, contributed 
the most to our NTI which reflects that region’s high 
level of flow visibility and counterparty and product 
coverage. There was also significant contributions 
from the US and APAC as we continue to leverage 
our efforts to diversify our trading activities across 
various asset classes and products. In the fourth 
quarter of 2023, Flow Traders reported total income 
of €74.3 million which reflected the generally 
subdued levels of activity in the markets seen 
throughout most of the year.
Operational expenses
On the cost side, fixed operating expenses increased 
to €178.4 million in 2023 (2022: €175.7 million). The 
main drivers of the increase in fixed expenses relate 
to the targeted base compensation increases 
implemented in Q2 of 2022, continued technology 
investments in line with business needs, and general 
price inflation. At year end FTEs decreased by 2% to 
646. Variable employee expenses decreased to €57.9 
million (2022:€103.7 million) which reflects the 
decline in business performance during the year as a 
result of the subdued market environment.
Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
was able to achieve operational leverage despite a 
challenging market environment with EBITDA 
margin of 22.0% in 2023 (2022: 39.0%) on EBITDA of 
€67.5 million (2022: €179.3 million).

Normalized IFRS reconciliation
Flow Traders makes certain adjustments to various IFRS expense and profit 
measures to derive Alternative Performance Measures (APM). The policy is to 
exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size 
and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful 
information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying 
performance. On this basis, the following items were adjusted or excluded for the 
2023 results reporting:
▪
Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the 
deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of 
prior years’ share plans. This adjustment provides insights into the relationship 
between the current year variable employee expenses and current year 
trading performance.
▪
Other income line includes all the realized and unrealized results on Flow 
Traders’ long-term equity investments, by including results on investments 
accounted for as Fair Value Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), and results 
of equity-accounted Investments in addition to the result of investment 
accounted for as Fair Value Profit and Loss (FVPL) included in IFRS total 
income.
▪
Exclusion of strategic advisory costs as one-off expenses in 2023 in relation to 
optimization of the Group legal entity and regulatory structure and further 
balance sheet review efforts.
▪
Tax expenses are adjusted based upon the pre-tax adjustments and/or 
excluded items above.
▪
Net trading income is normalized by reclassifying income related to long-term 
investments to other income.

Prime broker capital requirements
The prime brokers require the Group to maintain 
certain minimum capital levels. Prime brokers use 
various internal systems to calculate required capital 
amounts (e.g., the ‘internal haircut model’ and the 
‘margin based approach model’, both intending to 
ensure sufficient levels of risk allowances) and have 
different limits structure, pre-funding possibilities 
and cut-off times for wiring capital. 
The aggregate capital that the prime brokers require 
is significantly higher than their risk exposure. For 
example, we may clear two legs of one transaction 
through two different prime brokers. Even when the 
transaction is fully hedged (the risk is fully offset), 
each prime broker will still require capital for such 
position as if the risk is not being offset. The prime 
brokers cannot establish that the other prime broker 
has an offsetting position so they will charge a full 
capital requirement. This increases the capital they 
require us to maintain beyond what would be 
necessary. In addition, margin requirements of prime 
brokers are conservatively determined by the 
sophistication of their models and the regulatory 
requirements, which might not necessarily be 
efficient in respect of our business model and 
trading portfolios.
The following table sets out the capital required to 
be posted with our prime brokers and capital 
available (Net Liquidation value).

Dividend policy and dividend proposal 
Dividend policy
Flow Traders intends to pay dividends annually in 
two installments, with a target aggregate dividend 
pay-out ratio of at least 50 percent of the Company’s 
IFRS net profits realized during the financial year. 
The Board may decide that the profits realized 
during a financial year will fully or partially be 
appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. A 
distribution of (interim) dividends is subject to 
applicable rules and regulations, the Bye-laws of the 
Company, and the Board Rules.
It is anticipated that our interim dividends will be 
declared and paid following the publication of our 
results for the first half of each year. However, there 
can be no assurance that in any given year a 
dividend will be proposed or declared.
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts 
and timing thereof will depend on a number of 
factors, including legal and regulatory requirements, 
future profits, financial conditions, general economic 
and business conditions, future prospects and such 
other factors as the Board may deem relevant. Our 
intentions in relation to dividends are subject to 
numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, 
many of which may be beyond our control.
The Board may declare dividend and decide to make 
allocations to reserves and therefore decides how 
much of the profit will be allocated to the reserves. 
The dividend is subject to a non-binding advisory 
vote of the shareholders.
Reserves and dividend proposal for the 
financial year 2023
Pursuant to Bye-law 33.1, the Board has decided that 
of the profit for 2023 (totaling €36.2 million), an 
amount of €19.5 million shall be added to the 
reserves.
The Board declared a total cash dividend of €0.45 
per share and this will be paid out to shareholders 
for the financial year 2023, subject to a 15 percent 
dividend withholding tax (dividendbelasting). An 
interim cash dividend of €0.30 per share was paid 
out on 19 August 2023. This means that the final cash 
dividend proposal for a non-binding advisory vote to 
the General Meeting is €0.15 per share. Subject to 
approval by the General Meeting on 13 June 2024. 
Shares will trade ex-dividend on 17 June 2024. 
Payment of the final dividend is anticipated to be 
made on 21 June 2024.

Growth and talent
We continued to grow our global presence, trading 
strategies and infrastructure in 2023. We increased 
our institutional counterparty base globally to over 
2,400 as well as being connected to over 180 trading 
venues. To facilitate this growth, we continued to 
recruit new talent throughout the year across all 
segments of our business while keeping costs and 
headcount under control, ending the year with 646 
FTE (2022: 660).
Outlook
Looking ahead to 2024, normalized fixed operating 
expenses are expected to be in the same range as 
2023 as headcount is expected to be flat to down for 
the year, offset by continued technology 
investments and inflationary pressures.

Our risk management
Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF) forms the foundation of 
our approach to managing risks. The ERMF is 
documented in Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk 
Management Policy and is reviewed 
annually by our Board.
Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, 
quantify and document potential risks which are 
inherent to trading in an automated market-making 
firm. In the fast and dynamic environment of 
automated trading we designed our ERMF in such a 
way that it is robust, efficient and transparent. In the 
figure below, we present the stakeholders that have 
an interest and place value in how our framework 
operates. 
Our ERMF helps us to ensure that we have adequate 
systems and controls including the management of 
our liquidity and capital. This is delivered through a 
consistent, continuous and careful method for 
addressing, managing and prioritizing our key risks 
in the context of our Company’s strategic objectives.

Enterprise Risk Management
The objective of Flow Traders’ ERMF is to 
institutionalize a formal Risk Management 
Framework in the Company. The Board considers 
Risk Management as a central and integral part of 
the organization’s strategic management. 
Flow Traders aims for a good balance between its 
business activities, return on capital and related 
risks. Flow Traders’ Risk Management adopts a 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach to 
ensure that the Company’s Risk Appetite and profile 
are integrated in the day-to-day operations as well 
as the strategic, tactical and operational objective 
setting and decision making. Every year, Flow 
Traders Group Executive Committee derives its 
business targets after determining its strategic 
goals. Based on these targets and objectives, the 
Company formulates its risk appetite. The targets, 
objectives and risk appetite give direction to the 
various departments within the Company and are 
used to derive our strategic risks. 
We deliver on the risk activities set out in our annual 
Risk Management Cycle to ensure that the residual 
risk profile is (and remains) in line with our set risk 
appetite. In order to achieve this, we perform risk 
control self-assessments (RCSAs) to assess current 
risks and identify risks that have newly arisen. 
Following the RCSAs, the Board decides on the 
appropriate risk response.
Risk categories
Our risk taxonomy is split into five broad risk 
categories - Financial, Business & Strategic, 
Compliance & Ethical, Operational, and Technology 
risk - each with their own specific sub-risks-

Risk Taxonomy 
Domain
Level 1 Risk Category
Description of the Risk
Financial risk
Capital risk
Capital risk (cost of doing business) refers to the situation where 
potential loss of investment value happens due to factors such as 
market volatility, regulatory and PB requirements, economic 
downturns, or poor financial performance of a company. It is the risk of 
failing to meet compulsory capital requirements invested in an asset or 
investment which are needed to maintain a firm’s trading licenses and 
normal business activities and relationships with prime brokers.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refer to the inability to replenish capital to the required 
level.  This can happen when: 1) not being able to timely obtain 
additional funding at a reasonable cost and 2) an inefficient internal 
management on liquidity. This is the risk of not being able to quickly 
convert an investment into cash without experiencing a significant loss 
in value, due to a lack of buyers or sellers in the market, restrictions on 
trading, or the illiquid nature of the asset itself that lead to an inability 
to easily buy or sell an asset without incurring significant costs. It can 
also happen because of a lack of access to alternative sources of 
funding such as short-term loans, trading credit from certain 
platforms, etc. in a timely manner. This is the risk of internal 
management deficiency which can lead to liquidity constraints.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in 
market prices; in particular, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, and equity- and commodity prices.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution 
involved in trading in or issuing a financial instrument defaulting on an 
obligation.

Strategy risk
Risk that may arise from the pursuit of the Company’s business plan, from strategic changes in the business environment, and/
or from adverse strategic business decisions. Market activity risk is part of this risk as our NTI and profitability are primarily a 
function of the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the financial instruments in which we trade.
Concentration risk
Probability of loss arising from heavily lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties or products. Concentration risk 
also includes supplier dependency risks.
Project Delivery & 
Management risk
The risk of inaccurate project management leading to inadequate realization of project objectives.
Sustainability & 
Environment risk

realize strategic objectives.
Model risk
Model risk for a trading firm refers to the potential for adverse consequences resulting from errors or limitations in the financial 
models and algorithms used for trading and risk management. This risk arises from the reliance on mathematical models and 
computer algorithms to make trading decisions, value financial instruments, and manage risk. Model risk can stem from 
inaccuracies in the models, inappropriate assumptions, data errors, or the failure to account for all relevant market factors.
Reporting risk
The risk of not being able to report adequately to stakeholders (e.g., annual financial report, regulatory reporting).
Taxation risk
The risk of unexpected tax charges, including interest and penalties including tax related events resulting in for example a

Risk Management Governance 
The effectiveness of risk management is unavoidably 
linked to commitment and integrity. It is therefore 
crucial that the Board, the Executive Committee, 
global and local department heads, and all Flow 
Traders employees are aware of the Company's risk 
policies, Risk Appetite and their own responsibilities, 
as well as the responsibilities of Flow Traders as a 
whole. Flow Traders Risk Management is embedded 
across the organization in line with the three lines of 
defense model. 
The first line of defense is formed by Trading, 
Technology and Operations. These departments are 
crucial for the core processes within Flow Traders 
and are responsible for incorporating controls in the 
day to day trading and IT processes and for the 
continuous monitoring of Flow Traders’ systems and 
trading controls including onboarding of new 
counterparties.
The second line of defense is responsible for 
oversight and monitoring regarding regarding risk 
(market and credit risk, treasury, and operational 
management) compliance (including trading, 
regulatory, surveillance and AML KYC), legal and 
finance; together are responsible for the continuous 
risk management at Flow Traders.
The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’ 
Internal Audit Function (IAF). They provide 
independent and objective assurance and advice on 
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk 
management and control systems. It reports its

The annual Risk Management Cycle follows 
the below Risk Management Framework:
Every year the Executive Directors, with the support 
of the Executive Committee, set their business 
targets following the strategic goals. The strategic 
goals are generally formulated in November/
December. The Board approves the strategic goals 
and business targets. 
Additionally, the Board is involved in the strategy 
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are 
then translated into annual Company-wide, 
departmental and individual goals and discussed in 
an annual meeting with the Executive Committee 
and all relevant regional Operational Committees 
and the Board.
Based on the targets, objectives and current 
business operations, the Executive Directors 
formulate the risk appetite of the Company. The 
targets, objectives and risk appetite give direction to 
the various departments within Flow Traders and are 
used to derive the Company’s strategic risks.
Flow Traders’ Risk Management Cycle is 
implemented to manage our residual risk profile to 
remain in line with our risk appetite. To help achieve 
this, we perform Risk Self Assessments to identify 
and assess current or emerging risks. Following the 
Risk Self Assessments, department heads in 
cooperation with the Executive Directors will decide 
on the appropriate risk response. The effects of the 
chosen risk responses will be monitored and the 
actual residual risk profile will be mapped versus the 
appetite annually.

Risk reporting
Flow Traders has a standing Risk Committee that 
continuously assesses the risks we face in our 
business, and is comprised of our Global Head of 
Risk, the Executive Directors and certain members 
of the Executive Committee. 
Aside from regular ongoing communication, there is 
a formal monthly meeting in which we discuss all 
risk assessments and risk proposals related to 
position limits, strategies, procedures, liquidity and 
capital requirements and other requests. Any 
material change to our risk profile, systems, 
strategies and limits must subsequently be 
approved by the Executive Committee. 
In addition to this standing Risk Committee, we have 
a Risk & Sustainability Committee of the Board. All 
Non-Executive Directors of the Board are members 
of this Risk & Sustainability Committee. The Global 
Heads of the Control Functions inform the Risk & 
Sustainability Committee of the Board about the 
effectiveness of the internal risk management and 
control systems. This includes the reasonable 
assurance that the aforementioned systems do not 
contain any material inaccuracies. 
The tasks of the Risk & Sustainability Committee of 
the Board include supervision and monitoring, as 
well as advising the Executive Directors on the 
operation of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems. The Risk & 
Sustainability Committee is also responsible for 
providing advice to the Executive Directors on the 
Company’s development, performance, and 
sustainability of its trading strategies, as well as 
reviewing the risk of the Company. 
It also maintains regular contact with the Company’s 
Trading and Risk and Operations departments. 
For more information on the responsibilities of our 
Risk & Sustainability Committee, please see the 
chapter "Corporate Governance".
The monitoring of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems was previously 
identified as a priority. This is a major responsibility 
of the Board and its Risk & Sustainability Committee. 
Good progress has been made and the Board 
continues to oversee progress on this matter. 
All risks relevant to each of the committees of the 
Board are monitored in the Risk & Sustainability 
Committee of the Board. This means that the 
relevant items set out in best practice provision 1.4.1 
of the Corporate Governance Code have been 
discussed by the Board in 2023, all Non Executive 
Directors of the Board are members of the Risk & 
Sustainability Committee. 
For more information, please refer to the chapter 
Board Report.
Financial risks
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from 
unfavorable market movements in various drivers of 
a security’s price that may result in a financial loss 
for its holder. 
For illustration, the value of a financial instrument 
may fluctuate because of changes in factors such as 
equity prices, currency rates, future dividend 
expectations, interest rates and volatilities. 
Our hedging strategies (typically implemented by a 
combination of underlying securities and vanilla 
derivatives) along with our continuous monitoring of 
our positions aim to minimize this risk. 
Our trading philosophy is that we hedge our 
positions as perfectly as possible to minimize our 
market risk exposures.
Business strategy and market activity risk 
The Board and the Executive Committee establish 
effective policies and procedures that enable the 
Company to identify strategic risks and regularly 
reassess that its strategic objectives and business 
plans are being executed as intended in the 
competitive environment. Such assessments include 
Sustainability & Environmental risk considerations as 
well as Concentration Risk with respect to supplier 
concentrations and geographical footprint.
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of 
the level of trading activity, or trading volumes in the 
financial instruments in which we trade, and the bid-
ask spreads (which largely determine the profit on 
the trade, or margins, we capture). 
Trading volumes in securities, derivatives, 
currencies, commodities, digital assets and other 
financial instruments on exchanges and on other 
trading venues worldwide are directly affected by 
factors beyond our control, including economic and 
political conditions, broad trends in business and 
finance, regulatory requirements, actions by central 
banks, and changes in the markets in which such 
transactions occur.
To cope with periods of low market activity, we have 
diversified our trading into different products and 
across multiple markets. This is to safeguard that we 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023   
 
 
 
 
 
32


---

## Page 33

are not overly dependent on market activity in one 
particular asset class or product type. 
Over the past year, our organization has consistently 
extended its presence in the Digital Asset markets. 
We established a dedicated risk management team 
working closely with the trading desks. Our primary 
risk management objective is to diligently evaluate 
and mitigate credit, market, and operational risks in 
line with the firms risk appetite. This tactical step has 
enabled us to cultivate a comprehensive risk 
framework, integrating advanced automations for 
real-time monitoring and alerting. Throughout the 
year, our framework underwent rigorous testing on 
multiple occasions and proofed its effectiveness in 
safeguarding against major losses associated with 
Digital Asset trading activities.
Non-financial risks
Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, 
systems or external events. Operational risk 
management is an integral part of Flow Traders’ risk 
and control systems. The aim is to promote a 
proactive approach to risk management, incident 
identification, reporting, and resolution to minimize 
operational disruptions, financial losses, and 
reputational damage. Our operational risk is 
dominated by technology-related events at our 
exchanges and clearing members. Therefore, the 
level of our investment in technology is important to 
mitigate those associated risks as well as having 
resilient and robust internal systems and controls. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, 
high-performance and customized technology 
platform with frequent and controlled deployments 
of new hardware and software. 
Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement 
improvements in both hardware and software on an 
ongoing basis. Controlled releases of hardware and 
software enhancements provide for minimal 
disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or 
updates of our trading software) is being developed 
is strictly separated from the environment in which 
such trading software operates in production. 
Access to the source code is strictly controlled and 
limited. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control 
undisrupted trading activities in real time. Multilayer 
monitoring is employed to avoid errors. When an 
error does occur, the relevant teams are 
immediately notified via multiple different channels. 
We rely on multiple third-party service providers for 
business and market data, which is a key part of 
what is monitored. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with 
our proprietary technology platform, analyzing real-
time pricing data, and is designed to ensure that our 
order activity is conducted within strict 
predetermined trading and position limits. 
For example, our pre-trade risk controls are 
designed to prevent the trading engines from 
sending quotes that deviate from our predefined risk 
parameters. These include price and volume limits, 
which are set by our Risk Management department. 
This keeps our ordering, trading and positions well 
within our preset tolerance levels. Our post-trade 
monitoring tools include trade-level reconciliation of 
prices and positions against those of our exchanges 
and prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to 
penetration tests by external experts. We have a 
comprehensive IT security system that is designed 
to protect us from attacks both from internally and 
externally. 
Where we have a technical interface with 
institutions such as our prime brokers and 
exchanges, the integrity of the connection between 
the systems and the data that is being exchanged is 
subject to prior conformance testing and continuous 
monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, 
we continuously review to ensure it adequately 
captures relevant scenarios. For the lessons that we 
have learned from the COVID-19 global pandemic, 
we have already made substantial changes to our 
global approach to our site management. 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before 
we start trading on any new platforms, including 
platforms designated for trading digital assets. While 
many of these platforms remain unregulated, many 
have improved their own onboarding procedures 
and counterparty identification procedures. While 
we believe our own procedures are strong, the 
unregulated status of these platforms makes them 
inherently less institutionalized and supervised than 
regulated platforms.
Regulatory risk
We serve institutional counterparties and do not 
provide investment services or ancillary services to 
third parties, most of the markets we operate in and 
nearly all aspects of our business are highly 
regulated. Where applicable, entities forming part of 
the Group have obtained the regulatory licenses and 
approvals needed to operate these entities.

Flow Traders operates in three key trading hubs in 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong and New York, and has 
established offices in London, Milan, Shanghai, 
Singapore, Chicago and Paris. The Group currently 
trades on more than 180 venues worldwide as well 
as operating on numerous other venues through our 
brokers. Our regulatory landscape is broad as we 
have to comply not only with our local regulations, 
but also with the trading rules of all venues on which 
we trade. 
Legislators and regulators worldwide continue to 
closely supervise the world financial markets in 
which we operate. This places significant demand on 
Flow Traders to maintain a professional, well-
structured and compliant organization. 
We received authorization from the Financial 
Conduct Authority and completed the migration of 
activities of our branch office in London to a 
regulated subsidiary. The authorization enables us to 
increase our exposure to the UK financial ecosystem 
and maintain our physical footprint in the UK and 
how we interact with UK-based financial institutions.
Our Compliance department supports management 
and operations at Group and local level by 
identifying, advising on, reviewing and reporting on 
regulations. It also seeks to maintain a compliant 
business environment through staff training and 
monitoring in order to manage the Group’s 
conformance with its regulatory obligations.
Compliance together with Public Affairs monitors 
and assesses any forthcoming regulations that may 
impact the firm. During 2023 this included amongst 
others matters: 
The European Commission review of the European 
Central Securities Depositories Regulation that was 
adopted on 16 March 2022. Amendments on the 
mandatory buy-in regime in the Settled Discipline 
Regime (SDR) by proposing a "two-step approach". 
We will continue to monitor the future impact of 
mandatory buy-ins and to manage the two-way flow 
of cash penalties for failed transactions.
Compliance together with Public Affairs monitors 
and assesses any forthcoming regulations that may

matters: 
▪
The EC review of the European Central Securities 
Depositories Regulation that was adopted on 16 
March 2022. Amendments on the mandatory 
buy-in regime in the Settled Discipline Regime 
(SDR) by proposing a "two-step approach". We 
will continue to monitor the future impact of 
mandatory buy-ins and to manage the two-way 
flow of cash penalties for failed transactions.
▪
The legislative procedure on the MiFID/MiFIR 
review almost came to a close with the vote in 
the European Parliament in January 2024. This 
review aims to further improve the framework 
introduced by MiFID II. One of the key 
components is the post-trade consolidated tape 
that should be real-time and not include any 
deferrals. We are and have engaged with 
regulators and various stakeholders to continue 
our efforts to increase transparency in all markets 
we are active in.
▪
We completed the implementation of IFR/IFD. 
We have received minor pointers from the DNB 
and AFM around a few observations they would 
like to have clearly articulated in our next ICLAAP. 
We will continue to implement best practice as 
much as possible. Such conversations with our 
regulators as well as our peers are ongoing, and 
this will continue as this regulation matures along 
with any further interpretation by the EBA and 
DNB. 
▪
Digital Assets and related forthcoming 
regulations such as the prudential BIS paper, 
MiCAR and DORA remain a topic that garners 
significant attention. There is still variety of 
approaches taken by various governments and 
regulators from around the globe for this 
developing asset class. As a leading liquidity 
provider, we continue to follow these 
developments closely and remain an active 
contributor to key regulatory consultations. We 
anticipate the regulatory uncertainty will 
continue in 2024 and beyond. We are engaging 
with regulators on a global and local level to 
lobby for a clear and fair regulatory framework, as 
we believe that will lead to a mature ecosystem 
and sustainable growth for this asset class.  
The Compliance, Risk and Operations departments 
have promulgated and implemented controls, 
internal rules and processes that have been 
pragmatically developed following applicable 
regulatory requirements, guidelines from market 
authorities, and industry best practices. 
Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that laws and 
regulations are subject to change and will be 
interpreted differently in practice over time. 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable 
laws or regulatory requirements could adversely 
affect our reputation and in turn our long-term 
profitability and future business prospects. This may 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023

## Page 35

also be the case to a lesser degree for differences in 
interpretation or lack of timely or complete 
implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, 
disgorgement and censures, suspension or expulsion 
from trading venues or the revocation or limitation 
of licenses. 
We aim to minimize such risks by focusing 
considerable management attention to choose the 
most appropriate strategic approach, employing 
highly qualified compliance and risk professionals to 
allow the deployment of staff training; to efficiently 
update our monitoring and reporting systems; and 
to be able to continuously evaluate the impact of 
current and upcoming regulations on our operations 
to find the optimal path to evolve our processes. 
Notwithstanding such efforts and given the highly 
regulated nature of our business, we remain subject 
to routine (and more targeted) inquiries and audits 
from our global regulators and our trading venues. 
The outcome of such inquiries are difficult to predict 
and manage, however we aim to be as transparent 
as possible in the spirit of cooperation to facilitate a 
better understanding of how we manage risk.
In the course of 2023, Flow Traders B.V. received an 
information request by the AFM to investigate 
compliance with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act 
(Wft). Flow Traders duly provided all required 
documentation and complied in full with the 
request. In early 2024, the AFM notified Flow Traders 
that no formal proceedings would take place 
pursuant to this request. In parallel, the AFM and 
DNB requested further information at the end of 
2023 in order to investigate compliance with the 
Dutch Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing 
(Prevention) Act (“Wwft”). This information was 
delivered in full in January 2024. 
Environmental risk
While Flow Traders considers its overall impact on 
the environment to be low due to the office-
oriented nature of our business, we have 
nonetheless identified certain environmental risks: 
▪
Physical environmental risks such as earthquakes, 
forest fires and floods could negatively impact 
our physical infrastructure. This is particularly 
relevant to our server locations, which are 
distributed globally. Climate change will likely 
lead an increase in extreme weather events in the 
future. We have and will mitigate this risk by 
having a widely distributed server infrastructure 
with a high degree of system redundancy. In 2023 
forest fires in South East Asia have led to the 
closure of our Singapore office. This was 
mitigated by activities transferring to other office 
locations.
▪
Future regulation may also affect Flow Traders 
financially by putting a price on CO2 and other 
greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, CO2 
pricing may have an impact on how we seek to 
offset our carbon footprint in the coming years.
External risk
Given the highly interconnected nature of the 
financial markets ecosystem we are a part of, we 
recognize that should any of the risks referenced 
within this section materialize, there could be a 
negative impact on various external third parties. 
Specifically, market and operational risk events 
could negatively impact key parties within our value 
chain; namely our counterparties and our prime 
brokers. This could limit our counterparties’ ability to 
trade with us or settle trades effectively on a timely 
basis. Moreover, the various prime brokers we work 
closely with could also be exposed to similar risks. In 
order to monitor and mitigate such risks, we have 
built internal systems to monitor the credit risk 
exposures, and maintain an active Global Business 
Continuity Management Policy and Recovery Plan.
Compliance and transparency
Focus on anti-bribery, anti-corruption and 
anti-money laundering
Flow Traders continues to be a strong proponent of 
effective, efficient and equal regulation and we 
contribute to the regulatory dialogue in our key 
jurisdictions to campaign for markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly fashion. 
We are committed to complying with all relevant 
laws and regulations that apply to us, wherever we 
operate. Especially important are the rules around 
anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering.
Flow Traders applies its counterparty due diligence 
(KYC) program to all existing and prospective 
counterparties. Unregulated digital asset 
counterparties are subject to enhanced due 
diligence measures, in line with our risk based 
approach. Our KYC program ensures that all 
counterparties are reviewed and monitored for 
money laundering, terrorist financing and sanction-
related risks on an ongoing basis as well as at 
onboarding. 
Integrity and transparency are central to the way we 
run our business regardless of their seniority or role. 
The Company encourages everyone, from our Board 
to all our staff, to speak up and participate in our 
firm's open culture. This inclusive culture supports

our employees in complying with the applicable 
laws, regulations and our internal policies. 
We believe that each employee of Flow Traders has 
an individual as well as collective responsibility for 
ensuring an honest and ethical conduct of business 
within the Company. Our Code of Conduct, which 
forms part of our employment documentation, is the 
formalization of our behavioral values.

Ensuring adherence with our Code of Conduct is the 
responsibility of the Executive Committee. Any 
reported potential breaches are investigated fully by 
the Executive Committee and other members of our 
senior management team in accordance with 
existing clearly laid out procedures and policies. 
Our Code of Conduct can be found on our website 
www.flowtraders.com.
We also have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-
money laundering (AML) policies in place that apply 
to all our staff. We expect our counterparties, 
business partners, intermediaries, contractors and 
subcontractors to adhere to the same standards. We 
believe that the risk of bribery or corruption is very 
limited as we do not hold or manage client money or 
assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain 
production facilities or source raw materials. 
Nevertheless, our staff receives training in anti-
bribery, anti-corruption and AML practices, as the 
Board would like to reinforce the importance of 
these policies.
Key to our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy is 
that officials or counterparties that we work with 
may never be placed in an uncomfortable position. 
Therefore, no gifts nor favors that may lead (or have 
the appearance to lead) to obligations or embarrass 
any recipient, and no gifts nor favors of any 
substantial value may be given to any authorities or 
counterparties that we interact with. Any form of 
facilitation payments is strictly not permitted under 
any circumstances. We provide clear and recurring 
guidance on a regular basis in that respect.

As part of our constant monitoring, all expenses and

senior managers and employees must state the 
purpose and recipient of an expense.
We have zero tolerance approach towards bribery 
and corruption and we actively ensure that no such 
behavior occurs. No cases of bribery or corruption 
were reported in 2023.
Whistleblowers
In addition to our culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have a detailed 
Whistleblower Policy in place for all staff and 
relevant contractors, approved by the Board.  
The Whistleblower Policy has wide applications, 
including in respect of topics such as fraud, market 
abuse, corruption, anti-money laundering, theft, 
bribery, dishonoring the organization, global tax 
policy and any other structural misconduct that 
threatens the integrity and proper business conduct. 
All employees are required to participate in an online 
course on the Whistleblower Policy, as part of the 
Flow Academy, to create awareness and guidance 
on how to deal with misconducts and incidents 
described in Flow Traders Whistleblower Policy. 
Employees are free to raise issues and have the 
responsibility to report misconduct and incidents, or 
any reasonable suspicions. 
The Whistleblower Policy also provides any 
whistleblower with anonymity, confidentiality, and 
the Company will not impose sanctions on 
disclosure (or affect an employee’s legal position) 
when the employee reports a suspected misconduct 
in good faith, unless the employee is involved in the

issue that is being reported. We respect a non-
retaliation policy when a suspected misconduct is 
reported. Our Whistleblower Policy can be found on

Internal audit
The Internal Audit (IA) Function seeks to enhance 
and protect organizational value by providing risk-
based and objective assurance, advice, and insight. 
An efficient and effective IA contributes to strong 
internal controls and to a robust governance 
structure, which can address significant risks.
The scope of IA's work includes the examination and 
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of our 
governance, risk management and control 
processes. It also includes quality assurance work 
reviewing our performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve our stated goals and 
objectives.
Our Group Internal Audit Charter defines the IA’s 
purpose, authority, responsibility and position within 
the organization. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance 
provided by the Institute of Internal Auditors.

ESG at a glance
ESG sustainability strategy
The world is facing significant challenges in ensuring 
a sustainable future for our people and our planet. 
Many national and international initiatives are 
addressing these challenges. Every organization will 
have to play its own role in the transition to a 
sustainable society, depending on its impact and its 
opportunities.
Flow Traders’ ESG ambition is to contribute to 
markets functioning in a smooth manner which we 
believe will assist in financing the transition towards 
a sustainable society. Key to achieving our ESG 
ambition, is our collaboration with key stakeholders 
to deliver on our identified strategic themes.
Through our ESG sustainability strategy that 
comprises five strategic areas – Environmental 
footprint, Sustainable employment, Responsible 
supply chain, Good governance and Sustainable 
green transition – we continue to advance our 
corporate responsibility to create long-term value 
for our stakeholders as well as contribute to the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). We endorse sustainable impact while 
providing the best value for our stakeholders. 
Staying focused on what matters for our business 
and stakeholders, is the cornerstone of our strategy. 
Our material ESG sustainability topics
Flow Traders aims to focus our ESG (environment, 
social and governance) sustainability strategy on the 
matters and topics that are most important from a 
sustainability impact as well as a sustainability risk or 
opportunity perspective. 
In 2023, we completed an enhanced materiality re-
assessment which we initially conducted in late 
2020. This double materiality assessment (DMA) was 
undertaken as critical input to identify Flow Traders’ 
ESG strategic priorities, which will be implemented 
in the course of 2024. 
Based on the guidance from the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), the DMA 
concludes the following. (1) Flow Traders’ most 
significant impact is in relation to our people and our 
environment. (2) The most significant sustainability-
related risks and opportunities relate to our 
operations and from across relevant value chain 
actors. We derived this by looking at our impact at 
various levels, from society at large to our own 
business operations.
As a result of this extensive re-assessment, we have 
consolidated the material issues and our impact 
areas to five sustainability themes categorized by 
the environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
aspects of our Company, business and operations. 
This forms the basis for our sustainability reporting 
going forward. 
The DMA guidance from the ESRS, was formalized in 
late 2023, therefore in the 2023 Annual Report we 
report on the results of the DMA and the identified 
strategic priorities. In 2024, we will work on further 
developing our approach and deployment plans for 
each of these five strategic priorities. 
From the 2024 Annual Report (published early 2025) 
and subsequent reporting cycle, the ESRS standards 
and those topical standards resulting from our 
material topics will be the basis for CSRD-compliant 
disclosure in the Annual Report. 
Read more about the DMA process in section “Other 
information - Double materiality". 
Our ESG strategic themes 
Environment
We want to continue to expand our trading footprint 
and capabilities to ensure that sustainable 
investment products can be traded easily and 
efficiently, with minimal energy use and emissions. 
That is why we focus on energy efficiency and 
climate action to reduce our environmental footprint 
from our business operations. 
Social
Our proprietary cutting-edge technology for 
seamless execution of trading, would not operate 
without our talented team of over 600 employees. 
We prioritize sustainable employment, by creating 
an attractive workplace for all, leveraging an 
experienced talent pool that forms an open, diverse, 
and entrepreneurial team. 
We want to promote the drive for fair and 
transparent markets and fuel innovation in our 
ecosystem, in continuous collaboration with the 
financial and investment community. We view a 
responsible supply chain with robust human rights 
practices and positive environmental contribution

will benefit all our stakeholders and result in Flow 
Traders being a valued partner in our communities.
Governance
Being a player in the global financial ecosystem, 
good governance means that we must ensure that 
we always operate with high ethical standards in 
compliance with laws and regulations. We will act on 
our responsibilities and fully anchor them in the way 
we do business through our focus on integrated 
governance, engaged stakeholders and transparent 
reporting.
We believe that Flow Traders has an important role 
to play in the global financial ecosystem. We serve 
the real economy by allowing investors, including 
pension funds and retail investors, to manage their 
risks by being able to always trade. Moreover, 
market makers like Flow Traders, have contributed 
to making it cheaper and more efficient to trade 
than in previous decades, which benefits everyone.
In this key role Flow Traders has a responsibility to 
contribute to the financial stability and the 
sustainable agenda in the countries in which we 
operate (see Flow Traders’ value creation model). As 
a key market participant, at the core of the financial 
ecosystem, Flow Traders supports the acceleration 
of the sustainable green transition towards 
sustainable climate neutral economy to sustain 
growth and finance, notably by providing liquidity in 
the ever-growing suite of ESG ETFs.
Going forward
While we have re-assessed the material topics and 
strategic themes, the process of defining the metrics 
to measure our performance and success is  
underway and implementation will start in 2024. 
In addition, to ensure that we achieve our ambitions, 
we will focus on strengthening our organization’s 
governance structure to ensure that each project on 
our ESG sustainability roadmap is embedded in our 
operational business plans and the firm is well-
equipped to meet its targets.
We will report on our updated ESG ambitions using 
this set of metrics per our 2024 Annual Report. 
The table below provides an overview of our 
material topics, resulting from the DMA, and how 
those are bundled into strategic themes.

section “Other information - Double materiality".

Our value chain
Central to our approach in assessing the material ESG topics, is engagement with our value chain partners. We assess the current and potential future impacts, risks and 
opportunities from two perspectives: a) impacts resulting from our business activities on our stakeholders (Inside-Out view), and b) impacts resulting from the business 
activities from our upstream and downstream value chain on Flow Traders (Outside-In view). When identifying the material topics, we assess each ESG topic on the 
most granular level (so-called, sub-sub-topics) to allow focus on areas where impacts, risks and opportunities are likely to arise.

Environmental footprint
Flow Traders considers its overall direct 
environmental footprint to be low. The nature of our 
business characteristics is a relatively light carbon 
footprint in relation to its direct business activities. 
Our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions amounts to 1,197 
tCO2e, which is less than 30% of the total scope 1, 2 
and 3 footprints in 2023. In 2023, Flow Traders’ 
carbon footprint was equivalent to 4,157 tCO2e 
(2022: 2,993 tCO2e).
Nevertheless, Flow Traders is conscious of the 
challenges linked to climate change, the need to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to manage 
natural resources prudently. Since our first carbon 
footprint analysis, conducted four years ago, we 
have commenced the application of improved 
measurement models as well as expanded the scope 
of our reporting by gradually onboarding more 
scope 3 categories into our dataset. This is part of 
our approach for continuous improvement and our 
decision-making process. 
Examples of data maturity and improvement 
actions, among others, are:
▪
Reduced the amount of non-renewable energy 
sources at the data centers by more than 40%, 
from nearly 500 tCO2e to 275 tCO2e. 
▪
Included purchased IT related hardware in our 
scope 3 calculation, which is around 860 tCO2e.
▪
Our London office moved to 100% renewable 
energy.
Although we made good progress, we still see 
challenges in obtaining primary data from our 
suppliers. This was particularly relevant for the 
electricity consumption in our office buildings using 
primary data (scope 2). Flow Traders will focus in the 
coming years on deploying carbon reduction actions 
whenever possible. Flow Traders has a direct grasp 
only on Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions. For scope 3, we 
will need to initiate a dialogue with our entire value 
chain (upstream and downstream) to act on the bulk 
of these emissions. 
Flow Traders reports its scope 1 and 2 emissions via 
the operational control approach. Scope 2 
represents locations-based emissions from 
electricity consumption in our office buildings.

included in our calculation in section “Other 
information - About the non-financial indicators".

Note 1  The total scope 2 emissions reported in 2022 was 2,956 tCO2e. We noted an inconsistency in the primary data method applied for the calculation of the 
scope 2 emissions of our Amsterdam office. As a result the reported data for scope 2 emissions 2022 should be 1,750 tCO2e lower. The data table above 
reflects the adjustment.

Sustainable employment
Culture and values
We constantly evolve and enhance our culture to 
make Flow Traders the best place to work for our 
workforce. We have distilled our approach to culture 
into the following culture statement:
We are passionate about creating an international, 
diverse and empowering culture, which is focused 
on teamwork, collaboration and fostering talent. We 
are proud of our roots and 20 years' heritage, 
starting in Amsterdam, and how we have evolved 
into a global trading firm on a mission to bring 
greater transparency to markets, where we act as a 
responsible market participant. Through this 
entrepreneurial spirit the firm has grown and so have 
the people that work here. This results in a truly 
unique culture, where colleagues make connections 
and work together across functions and 
geographies. We engage together on not only work 
but also on a passion for sports, get-togethers and 
events. We are also incredibly proud of the diversity 
we foster with 50+ nationalities and we make sure 
colleagues can be themselves. Colleagues join the 
Company at different stages in their career, from 
graduates to professionals, making Flow Traders a 
place for colleagues to develop personally, 
professionally and grow their career. Our culture is 
underpinned with a strong set of values that we 
thrive across our Company.  
Our values
Maintaining and nurturing our culture 
Our culture is a key success factor for Flow Traders 
and is extremely important to everyone across the 
organization:
▪
Flow Traders Leadership - through the 
organization of firm-wide events and regular all-
staff updates. In addition, feedback received 
from our annual engagement survey is reviewed 
in detail by relevant leaders and action plans are 
derived. 
▪
Business Departments - through providing 
specific trainings or learning sessions to actively 
stimulate our workforce in their personal and 
career development. 
▪
Colleagues - through reinforcing our culture 
bottom up, colleagues organize their own events, 
competitions, and charitable endeavors. 
▪
Societal commitments and charities - through 
supporting multiple charities through our 
dedicated Flow Traders Foundation, not only 
financially but also by offering access to our 
knowledge and experience.
Flow Traders leverages numerous robust enablers to 
make all employees feel included and safe as well as 
reinforcing a positive work culture:
▪
Group of internal and external ‘trusted persons’ to 
discuss challenges and difficulties in private, in 
case desirable.
▪
Zero-tolerance policy in case of unacceptable 
behavior in any form whatsoever and clear follow 
up procedures towards all stakeholders.
▪
Recently refreshed DE&I policy including targets.

Diversity and inclusion
Flow Traders is a multinational company with offices 
worldwide. This naturally creates an environment 
where people of diverse cultures and backgrounds 
collaborate to achieve our mission, excel in their 
roles, and perform at their highest potential.
We have a long-standing policy of recruiting and 
retaining the best talent available and aim to provide 
an inclusive working environment regardless of the 
gender, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation of our 
employees. We are committed to providing equal 
employment opportunities to all qualified job 
applicants.
We believe, companies that are diverse in e.g., age, 
gender, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental 
ability, ethnicity, and perspective are proven to be 
more successful in attracting talent and accomplish 
better performance and growth. 
Flow Traders embraces this philosophy and sees the 
added value diversity brings to our business. Our 
current Company demographics are also something 
to be proud of:
▪
Over 25% of the world’s nationalities (of all 
inhabited continents) are represented in our 
600+employee workforce over 10 offices globally.
▪
Our people bring in experience of 50+ academic 
study backgrounds, providing multiple angles, 
broad perspectives, and insights to solve 
challenges together and develop personally by 
learning from others.
▪
We are a relatively young Company with an 
overall average age of 33.7 years. However, we 
see a healthy mix of ages through all ranks with 
~44.8% of our workforce in the age category of 
30-40 years old. Average age between our three 
Company divisions (Trading, Technology, and 
Business Support) is also balanced with a 
difference in average age of less than five years.
▪
Our Business Support division, comprising of 167 
employees, shows a balanced ratio of 49.1% 
female employees in line with the sector 
benchmark of 44%. The Technology and Trading 
divisions female representation is growing.
▪
We employ people from 57 nationalities across 
our offices. 
We strongly encourage women to apply for any 
function within the firm, particularly when they have 
a background in fields that traditionally have a 
higher proportion of male employees. 
To keep evolving, enforcing, and nurturing our 
Company culture we want to increase our D&I 
efforts. Therefore, we have indicated several targets 
across the three key themes, some of these targets 
are mandatory and need to be made public (in e.g., 
the Annual Report) or reported to external 
organizations (e.g., the “Sociaal Economische Raad”). 
Other targets are voluntary targets that we feel 
strongly about.
Below is Flow Traders’ D&I approach for the coming 
years up to 2025. Mandatory KPIs/targets have been 
marked to clarify the difference between chosen 
metrics/targets and metrics/targets that are non-
negotiable. In general, we aim to incorporate 
diversity aspects such as nationality, age, gender, 
educational background or professional background 
into decision making concerning the composition of 
our workforce. To the extent possible, this also 
applies to the composition of our Board, and 
Executive Committee, as well as the corporate 
bodies of Flow Traders B.V.
Regardless of rules and regulations, we see diversity 
as a means to guarantee a safe and inclusive 
environment for our employees. Nonetheless, since 
the introduction of “de wet ingroeiquotum en 
streefcijfers” as per 1 January 2022 it has become 
increasingly important to track explicit metrics and 
have clear targets. This piece of legislation obliges 
corporates to disclose several diversity metrics. We 
therefore aim for the following goals and targets:
▪
Strive to have more than 20% of world’s 
nationalities working at Flow Traders (currently 
25%).
▪
Strive to have women in Technology at par with 
the market (benchmark 17%).
▪
Strive to have at least 1/3 female and 1/3 male 
Non-Executive Directors.
▪
Strive to have at least one female and one male 
Executive Director.
▪
Flow Traders Top-50 (which includes the 
members of the Executive Committee) reflects 
the total workforce gender distribution.

## Page 44

We will also implement initiatives to keep D&I top of 
mind. Below a subset of what is on the roadmap:
▪
Increase our range of (online) trainings on 
communication and unconscious bias.
▪
Include a D&I module in our Leadership training 
to train our managers on inclusive leadership.
▪
Start with “high performing team training” and 
offer team activities around D&I to ensure more 
inclusive collaboration and train employees in 
understanding how inclusion will improve 
performance / high performing teams.
▪
Keep reviewing policies and procedures on a 
yearly basis and update/create were applicable 
or required by law.
We also believe in open communication and 
encourage collaboration across the firm. Everyone 
within the firm has unrestricted, direct access to 
senior management and are regularly informed and 
consulted about key developments. People are 
encouraged to speak their minds to help make Flow 
Traders a better place to work. Information travels 
freely and is not restricted unless we need to protect 
overriding interests, such as those concerning 
regulations, commercial sensitivities or to protect 
our intellectual property. We believe that a diverse 
workforce, which has open communication 
channels, helps create a richer variety of ideas and 
solutions. 
Employee engagement
Flow Traders undertakes an annual global employee 
engagement survey to gather feedback on how to 
improve our culture and ensure a positive employee 
experience for all colleagues. Engagement is a 
measure of how committed and enthusiastic 
employees are about their work and the 
organization. When people are engaged, they feel 
more comfortable being themselves at work. 
Different factors contribute to employee 
engagement, including organizational culture, work 
environment, work relationships, and development 
opportunities.
Giving honest responses combined with anonymity 
are essential and therefore in 2023, we have once 
again collaborated with Peakon, a specialized third-
party survey provider. The collaboration with Peakon 
began in 2021. This ensures all responses remain 
confidential and no individual results are identifiable. 
In 2023, on the engagement score, a 7.0 was scored, 
below the target of 7.7. This target was kept the 
same for 2023 as in 2022. This is the average score 
given by our employees in response to the main 
engagement question in the annual global employee 
engagement survey as described above. This 
compares to an engagement score of 7.4 recorded in 
2022 (slightly below the target of 7.6). In addition, 
Flow Traders is benchmarked against the broader 
financial industry who also undertake Peakon 
surveys.
Human capital development 
Talent 
Since the day we were founded, our goal has been 
to foster a culture that encourages innovation, and 
risk-awareness, while focusing on drive, teamwork 
and ownership. By developing talent in-house and 
maintaining a committed and substantial employee 
shareholder base, we have strengthened internal 
bonds and helped create a loyal, forward-looking 
team. We are proud that we create and maintain 
high-quality jobs, which result in a stable and 
trusting working environment that benefits our 
people, our business, and society.
As an evolving Company and having successfully 
created high quality jobs across a variety of 
departments. In 2023, we welcomed 124 new hires 
(2022: 206). 
To make sure they feel at home quickly, we offer full 
relocation support for everyone moving to our 
offices from abroad. We help with finding a home, 
applying for a visa and getting to know the local 
culture. We also offer our international employees 
based in Amsterdam the opportunity to attend 
Dutch language classes. In 2023, 59 employees took 
advantage of this offer and attended a Dutch 
language class (2022: 62). 
Recruitment 
We seek to attract the best talent around the globe. 
Operating in a financial market environment, with 
stringent legislation and complex technology, our 
selection standards remain high – our candidates 
need to go through several tests and interviews. 
Although our traders have a varied educational 
background, they share a strong numerical aptitude, 
which is why a numerical test is an important part of 
the selection procedure. To find people with the 
unique skill sets needed for a global liquidity 
provider our recruitment approach for our trading 
and technology positions, focuses on graduates. Our 
labor market program aims to reach young talent 
(early career talents), among others, through:
▪
Campus visits
▪
University career fairs and workshops
▪
In-House Business Courses for students to 
experience trading practice
▪
Dedicated events with partners such as Female x 
Finance

To make sure that our new colleagues feel welcome 
and continue their leap learning curve, we invest in 
the Graduate Software Development Program and 
an extensive Graduate Trading Program, which will 
enhance the experience of new graduates joining 
the firm. Throughout the program, graduates receive 
continuous support from dedicated mentors, not 
only in the field of expertise, but also around 
personal development.
Work environment 
The health and well-being of our employees is a key 
priority. All our offices are designed to provide a 
pleasant and ergonomically sound place to work, we 
offer healthy breakfast and lunch options, and 
organize great Company trips and parties. We 
believe these benefits are important to maintain a 
healthy and happy workforce, and to stimulate 
bonding and connections beyond employees’ direct 
circle of colleagues. We have formally instituted a 
hybrid working policy whereby certain functions 
have the option of working from home for two days 
a week. To facilitate this, we have continued to 
invest in people’s home office environments by 
granting a budget for buying equipment.
Dedicated Flow Academy 
Continuous investment in our people is a key priority 
for the firm. By using a variety of learning solutions 
and knowledge management to unlock people’s 
potential and foster a culture of learning. 
We understand that employee development is never 
a straight line as employees are at different stages in 
their employee journey and have different needs. 
We offer various career paths and have various tools 
in place to support our employees’ career 
navigation. Through Flow Academy we offer 
everyone varied training opportunities, aimed at 
improving function-specific skills or their personal 
development. 
In total, employees undertook 35,238 training hours 
during 2023 (2022: 10,733) which comprised of 
onboarding, leadership training, mandatory training, 
e-learnings and coaching programs.
Many of our managers are ‘home-grown’, having 
developed into their positions after several years of 
working with the Company. They set an example 
and act as an inspiration for new hires, illustrating 
the career paths open to them. Additionally, to 
complement self-growth, we also like to give our 
employees the chance to transfer between our 
offices and experience life and work elsewhere.
Labor practices, including human rights
We believe in sharing our profits with all relevant 
stakeholders, including our employees. Given good 
performance, employees from any role and office 
are entitled to receive variable compensation 
relative to their contribution to the firm. We are 
transparent about how we pay our people and how 
much we pay them, including management. We 
have a Remuneration Policy that permits variable 
pay only when a profit is made. We are constantly 
looking for ways to improve our remuneration 
principles. And because variable remuneration is, to 
a large extent, deferred, it remains at risk of 
forfeiture if we sustain a loss. We believe this is the 
strongest incentive for sustainable, risk-aware 
behavior for all our staff. 
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, thus 
aligning the Company’s long-term success to their 
personal financial circumstances. Since IPO, we have 
utilized several share schemes. In 2020, a new share 
plan was introduced which provides the award up to 
50% of variable remuneration in shares (or share-like 
instruments). This seeks to further embed share 
ownership across our employee base.
On 31 December 2023, 445 employees out of 646 (31 
December 2022, 457 out of 660) employees are 
active participants of various employee share plans.
At Flow Traders, we also have a great respect for 
human rights in every jurisdiction where we operate. 
Moreover, Flow Traders operates in an industry 
where the risk of modern slavery and human 
trafficking is inherently low and in jurisdictions 
where labor standards are high.
Nonetheless, since 2022 we have been a signatory to 
the United Nations Global Compact. Flow Traders 
complies with these fundamental rights, 
conventions and recommendations, notably social 
rights, freedom of association and equality, 
abolishment of forced and child labor.  
Privacy and data protection
We are committed to respecting and protecting the 
privacy rights of employees, counterparties, issuers, 
exchanges, suppliers and everyone we do business 
with. Personal data is managed in a professional, 
lawful and ethical way, in line with our Staff Manual 
and Code of Conduct and in compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
We have technical and organizational measures in 
place intended to prevent accidental or unlawful 
destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure 
of, or access to, personal data. Our Privacy Policy 
sets the minimum requirements from the 
perspective of Flow Traders as a global organization. 
The policy is binding for all Flow Traders employees 
and applies to the processing of personal data of our 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023

## Page 46

staff, job applicants and business partners such as 
customers, suppliers, visitors and other individuals.
A dedicated privacy and personal data protection 
program ensures we adhere to high standards of 
personal data protection. Among other elements, 
the program covers:
▪
Governance: At the senior management level, the 
Risk Committee is responsible for oversight of 
the topic of privacy, while the Data Privacy 
Officer manages the privacy framework and aids 
with guidance. Each employee is responsible for 
reading and understanding the content and 
implications of the Privacy Policy.
▪
Systems and procedures: The Privacy Controls 
Framework includes privacy impact assessments 
and data protection impact assessments. The 
privacy controls framework is included in our 
ERM process.
▪
Disciplinary actions: We investigate all incidents, 
concerns and reports of potential breaches, as 
outlined in our data breach procedure. We take 
appropriate control measures and disciplinary 
actions to prevent reoccurrence.
▪
Audit: Privacy is included in our Internal Audit 
Program.
Our privacy notices for both business partners and 
recruitment are derived from our Privacy Policy. 
They explain why personal data is collected and how 
Flow Traders uses it.
In late 2020, we updated our Privacy Notice on our 
website. The new Privacy Notice reflects the latest 
processing of personal data within Flow Traders and 
meet the requirements of the applicable privacy 
laws and regulations, for example GDPR (EU) and 
CCPA (US).
Responsible supply chain
Operating in a financial market characterized by 
stringent regulations, fast global trade, complexity 
and sensitivity of information requires several key 
business conduct requirements from the supply 
base. 
In this interconnected financial market ecosystem, 
we and our partners outsource services and business 
processes. This encounters corporate social 
responsibility and reputational risks. Our supply 
chain is an important extension of our business 
activities and therefore we must ensure that they 
act responsibly and foster a similar ESG focus. 
Incidents, controversies or disruptions in the 
upstream value chain have a direct impact on the 
service reliability and reputation of Flow Traders at 
downstream value chain partners.
Due diligence and procurement practices
To drive a sustainable and resilient supply chain, we 
place high importance on supplier performance 
management and supply chain risk management. 
Our supply chain strategy is centered on long-term 
relationships and close collaboration with our 
suppliers and partners. Our goal is to ensure that our 
proprietary technology infrastructure can 
continuously and seamlessly provide liquidity for 
financial products. 
With over 100 suppliers in our total global supplier 
base, we distinguish between technology related 
and other services related suppliers. Technology 
related suppliers provide excellence for our 
technology infrastructure, such as technology 
platforms, cloud service providers, data centers and 
other software and hardware suppliers. This 
category represents most of our total procurement 
spend. Other services related suppliers are those 
providing products and services supporting our 
operations, varying from office space to food, travel 
and general office suppliers. 
Our supply chain is the main contributor to our GHG 
footprint, representing roughly 95% of our total 
carbon footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3). As we seek to 
ensure a responsible supply chain, to deploy a 
Supplier Code of Conduct and ESG due diligence 
program is part of our sustainability ESG focus 
derived from our 2023 double materiality 
assessment. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is an important tool to 
attest our commitment to sustainability and to 
communicate what we expect from our suppliers to 
respect and contribute to our sustainability goals. As 
such, we encourage our suppliers to adopt 
sustainability practices to ensure that their business 
operations are environmental and socially 
responsible and conducted ethically. 
In 2024 we will further enhance our ESG due 
diligence program and supplier sustainability 
program.

Good governance
Business conduct
As of 13 January 2023, Flow Traders operates a one-
tier Board governance structure, comprising 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The 
Executive Directors along with the Executive 
Committee are responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Company and setting and 
achieving our objectives. The Non-Executive 
Directors on the Board supervise and advise the 
senior management team. The Board is accountable 
to the Annual General Meeting for the Company's 
and its performance.
Our governance is reflected in our internal rules and 
regulations, including our Articles of Association, By-
laws, the Terms of Reference of our Board 
committees, and our Code of Conduct. These, 
together with our policies, can be found on our 
website. 
Flow Traders remains focused on long-term value 
creation, culture and risk management while 
balancing the interests of our many stakeholders, 
such as shareholders, senior management 
executives, counterparties, suppliers, investors, 
employees, regulators, and the community. When 
making decisions, the Board carefully weigh the 
interest of all these stakeholders in relation to our 
Company objectives and ESG strategic priorities. 
Flow Traders ESG strategic priorities are determined 
and set by the Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee with regular monitoring by the Board. 
Please refer to the chapter ‘Governance’ for further 
information.
At Flow Traders, business integrity means 
conducting business within a framework of laws and 
regulations, to high ethical standards, and in 
accordance with our own policies and procedures. 
Being a responsible market participant is embedded 
across our approach to governance and part of our 
core value set. We operate a rigorous first and 
second line defense as part of our risk management 
approach including continuous monitoring, 
comprehensive trading controls and processes such 
as AML and KYC across our entire footprint.  
An example of our high levels of business integrity 
can be seen in the fact we have zero tolerance 
towards bribery and corruption, and we actively 
ensure that no such behavior occurs. No cases of 
bribery or corruption were reported in 2023 (and in 
2022 as well). Continuous training of staff as well as 
robust risk and compliance controls contribute to 
the business integrity of Flow Traders.
Public affairs
Flow Traders operates in one of the most regulated 
and competitive markets. We actively seek to 
connect with numerous stakeholders and peers to 
collaboratively discuss and align on regulatory 
matters impacting the industry we operate in. 
In 2023, we contributed and facilitated dialogues on 
these key regulatory developments: 
▪
IFR/IFD
▪
EU Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCAR)
▪
T+1 Settlement in the US
▪
MiFIR Review 
As part of our regulatory agenda, we collaborate 
with other market participants, governments, 
regulators, interest groups and trade associations to 
align on key issues impacting the industry we 
operate in. One of the key pillars of this strategy is to 
establish open dialogues with our stakeholders, 
responding to their views and concerns in order to 
be able to balance competing expectations. We are 
always keen to address pressing issues, demonstrate 
our positive impact to society and ultimately 
improve our business. As part of our collaborative 
strategy, we contribute to representative bodies like 
the EU Consolidated Tape Expert Group and various 
advisory committees of exchanges. We are an active 
member of several trade associations and are 
participating specifically in the Board of the Dutch 
Association of Proprietary Traders (APT) and the 
Executive Committee of the European Proprietary 
Traders Association (FIA-EPTA). In these trade 
associations we have representation on several 
committees regarding market structure, prudential 
regulation, digital assets and Dora, sustainable 
finance and ESG, diversity and well-being. Flow 
Traders is also a member of Holland Fintech, the 
International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and 
participates in several other professional networks.

Tax
We are committed to being good corporate citizens, 
bringing positive value to the communities we 
operate in. A key part of this commitment involves 
paying taxes where they are due and subscribing to 
fair taxation. In 2023 we incurred total corporate 
income taxes of €8.5 million (2022: €34.9 million) 
which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.0% (2022: 
21.6%). 
We believe it is vital to operate a fair, transparent 
and straightforward Tax Policy, which is required 
when running a sustainable business and delivering 
long-term value to all our stakeholders. This is also 
reflected in the tax principles included in our 
Principles of Responsible Tax Behavior Policy, as 
published on our website. The tax principles also 
serve as KPIs throughout our performance 
measurement. The Flow Traders Tax Function will 
therefore provide applicable input as part of the 
approval process for business proposals to ensure a 
clear understanding of the tax consequences. 
Flow Traders also established a Tax Control 
Framework, members include the Board, Audit 
Committee, Finance department, Tax department 
and external auditors. They are responsible for 
assessing and weighing the risks associated with the 
tax decision process for our business and 
stakeholders. Under this Tax Control Framework, 
significant tax positions, including the tax strategy, 
are always shared with and subject to the approval 
of the Board. 
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect 
of its financial reporting and its relations with tax 
authorities globally. Regarding financial reporting, 
conservative accounting principles are being applied 
and one-offs must occur infrequently and be clearly 
documented. 
We support transparency initiatives, such as Pillar II 
legislation and country-by-country, and frequently 
assess the impact of such initiatives. We also closely 
monitor impact for Flow Traders, to ensure that we 
comply with local and international legislation and 
meet our reporting obligations. Where necessary or 
relevant, we take the appropriate actions to adopt 
these initiatives in our Tax Control Framework. We 
have good standing relationships with the tax 
authorities in each region in which we operate. We 
proactively manage our relationship with the tax 
authorities with the aim of minimizing the risk of 
challenge, dispute or damage that could have an 
impact on our credibility.
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local and international tax 
legislation. We do not use tax haven jurisdictions for 
tax avoidance purposes and carry out our business 
through entities resident in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the Company can operate its 
business in line with its belief that it is part of the 
corporate social responsibility duty to pay taxes 
where it operates. In addition to corporate income 
taxes, Flow Traders pays many other taxes, including 
but not limited to, payroll taxes and social security 
contributions on the wages of its employees, value 
added taxes and property taxes. All these taxes are a 
significant basis of funding governmental public 
services. It is our social responsibility to contribute 
through taxes in the regions we operate in. 
For more information on our tax position, please 
refer to note 14 of the financial statements.

Cyber security
As a global liquidity provider, Flow Traders is 
exposed to cyber risk. Increasing in sophistication, 
frequency and persistence, cyber risks are growing 
more dangerous and diverse. An essential part of 
'Good Governance' is ensuring that these risks are 
managed appropriately and are focused on by the 
Board and relevant members of management.
Significant cyber events continue to be observed in 
the financial sector and in the broader economy that 
demonstrate the sophistication of cyber adversaries 
and the impact they can have on the victim 
organization. Cyber risk is driven by the increasing 
use of data, technology and digital services by Flow 
Traders and by our supply chain. In addition to the 
direct impact on ourselves and our customers, our 
role as a key part of the financial market 
infrastructure ecosystem means that a significant 
cyber event could create a knock-on impact to the 
global markets that we are active in. We must 
acknowledge, to remain competitive in this era of 
data and digitalization, that cyber risk cannot be 
eliminated. However, it can be managed to a level of 
risk that we are prepared to take as a cost of doing 
business.
We continue to make significant investments in 
cyber security and have a dedicated Security 
function led by our Head of Security which is 
focused on protecting and defending Flow Traders 
against cyber attacks. Due to the increasing 
sophistication of cyber adversaries and the 
techniques that they use, we proactively collect and 
evaluate threat intelligence. We recognize that the 
prevention of cyber attacks may not always be 
possible, and our focus and priority is on remaining 
resilient to withstand cyber attacks with minimal 
disruption to our business. Our approach to cyber 
security aligns to industry best practice and we will 
continue to invest and advance our cyber defense, 
detection, response and recovery capabilities. As 
outlined in "Our Risk Management", Flow Traders 
operates a three lines of defense framework and the 
Risk function provides independent oversight and 
challenge.
2023 saw some notable achievements from a cyber 
security perspective:
▪
Advanced security infrastructure: In 2023, we 
enhanced our cybersecurity infrastructure with 
state-of-the-art technologies. This includes the 
expansion of capabilities in the areas of advanced 
threat detection systems, threat intelligence and 
the integration of AI-driven security models, 
significantly improving our ability to detect, pre-
empt and respond to cyber threats.
▪
Employee training and awareness: Recognizing 
that human factors play a crucial role in 
cybersecurity, we conducted comprehensive 
training programs for our employees. These 
initiatives aimed to foster a culture of security 
awareness and vigilance across all levels of our 
organization.
▪
Security governance and compliance: Our efforts 
in 2023 led to enhanced compliance with 
international ISO/IEC 27001 standard. This not 
only demonstrated our commitment to best 
practices in information security but also 
provided a framework for continuous 
improvement.
▪
Stakeholder transparency: We increased 
transparency and risk awareness with our 
stakeholders regarding our ISMS practices, 
reinforcing trust and showcasing our 
commitment to protecting their data.
▪
Sustainability through cyber resilience: Our 
efforts in cyber resilience contributed to the 
sustainability of our operations, minimizing 
disruptions and ensuring business continuity 
even in the face of increasing cyber threats.

Sustainable green transition
Global transition towards sustainability and net zero 
has become imperative due to pressing 
environmental challenges, such as climate change 
and biodiversity loss. The entire financial sector must 
play its part in accelerating the transition towards 
green and sustainable capital markets that deliver on 
the common goals of a green economy and climate 
neutrality.
Flow Traders as an independent market maker and 
liquidity provider is committed to supporting the 
transition towards a sustainable financial sector.
We believe that a mature and healthy secondary 
markets ecosystem of ‘green’ Exchange-Traded 
Derivatives (ETDs, i.e., listed futures and options) and 
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), needs to be 
developed alongside the primary and secondary 
markets for sustainable shares and bonds. This will 
help foster a liquid market for sustainable 
investment and risk management which is needed 
to ensure that Sustainable Finance is fully embedded 
into mainstream financial markets.
The key for a successful green transition is the 
secondary markets because they enable asset 
holders to buy or sell ESG products on behalf of end-
investors (both retail and institutional), insurance 
holders, or pension participants. Market makers 
provide liquidity and choice to investors to adjust 
their portfolios, pursue their trading and investment 
strategies and manage their risk, at low cost and 
with ease globally.
Flow Traders offers end investors the opportunity to 
buy or sell on a continuous basis while at the same 
time maintaining tight bid and ask spreads, 
contributing to price discovery across products and 
asset classes. Long-term investors are also able 
through the provision of liquidity in ESG products to 
always buy or sell financial instruments, without 
having to wait for another long-term investor 
looking to do the opposite. Through this, liquidity 
provision by Flow Traders results in lower 
transactional costs and reduces risk for end 
investors. As a consequence, via increasing price 
transparency and reducing search costs, asset 
managers are able to more efficiently navigate the 
sustainable investment market and lowering the 
costs for all end-investors.
Flow Traders supports investors with the migration 
toward a green portfolio by supplying liquidity in 
sustainable products and making sure there remains 
a counterparty to buy their ‘brown’ products/assets. 
Converting out of brown assets needs to be done 
over time as there are not yet enough alternatives to 
support a faster transition.  
Innovation management
Innovation has been at heart of Flow Traders ever 
since our inception in 2004. As a technology enabled 
liquidity provider, we are constantly innovating 
across our business. 
From a technology standpoint, this involves creating 
new trading algorithms as well as enhancing and 
refining existing ones. In terms of our technology 
infrastructure, we have focused on reducing latency, 
improving connectivity with trading platforms and 
implementing cloud-based solutions.
As a key market participant, Flow Traders will 
support new sustainability-focused products such as 
the growing suite of ESG ETFs. We have also been at 
the forefront of the movement to institutionalize the 
adoption of digital assets.
In 2022, Flow Traders Strategic Capital, a dedicated 
venture capital unit, was established to actively 
invest in the development of financial markets 
infrastructure and the digital asset space. The 
primary focus of Flow Traders Strategic Capital is to 
invest in innovative ventures that accelerate growth, 
create greater transparency within the digital asset 
space and enable financial ecosystem scalability.
Social impact
Functioning financial markets are a cornerstone of 
modern society and allow businesses and individuals 
to manage investments and associated risks. The 
provision of liquidity is the lifeblood of financial 
markets thus reflected in society more broadly and 
specifically in areas such as lowering the cost of 
investing.
As described earlier, Flow Traders’ approach to 
innovation will contribute to the transition to green 
and sustainable capital markets which all of society 
can benefit from.

Flow Traders 
Foundation
The Flow Traders Foundation is focused on fighting 
poverty. It aims to aid those living in poverty with 
support to improve their well-being. The Foundation 
will achieve this by, but not limited to, providing 
direct and indirect aid (goods), granting 
microcredits, providing information, volunteering for 
events, support initiatives donated by Flow Traders’ 
employees, and or/financial means.
In the past decade, employees and Flow Traders 
have supported several initiatives. In 2020, the Flow 
Traders Foundation was formalized to continue our 
efforts on a broader scale. Our belief has always 
been that while providing support is crucial, 
whoever initiates a project is in the lead. This has 
always been done based on the believe that those 
involved should be supported, this approach has 
enabled a network of ambassadors within the 
organization to work together. 
The Foundation supports several long-term 
initiatives and in 2023 we supported charities across 
our regions and brought to life projects in our 
communities.
 
The Foundation started supporting SINA in 2020 and 
provides both financial support as well as providing 
volunteers and expertise to help the charity grow. 
SINA supports families who live below the poverty 
line and conducts Home Visits during which they aid 
families with purchasing furniture such as 
mattresses, cupboards and provide tutoring for 
children. Our support goes towards helping with the 
Home Visits.
 
The Foundation started collaborating with Project 
Backboard in 2022 in New York, they aim to renovate 
basketball courts to strengthen communities. Our 
colleagues in New York worked in close 
collaboration with Project Blackboard to complete a 
full basketball court renovation close to the office, 
with a local artist committed to help decorate the 
court.

Functioning of the 
Board
The Board is responsible for the continuity of the 
Company and is guided by the interests of the 
Company and its associated business, taking into 
consideration the Company’s sustainable long-term 
value creation and the interests of the Company’s 
stakeholders, including our employees and our 
shareholders, as defined in the Bye-laws as 
stakeholder interests. This ensures decisions are 
made in a balanced manner.
The Executive Directors are primarily charged with 
the Company's day-to-day operations, subject to the 
limitations set out in the Companies Act and the 
Bye-laws. Two Executive Directors can jointly 
represent the Company, reflecting the four-eyes 
principle we operate across the Company: at least 
two persons must sign off on business decisions. The 
Board may further allocate the duties of the 
Executive Directors among individual Executive 
Directors. The Executive Directors may submit 
resolutions that can be adopted on behalf of the 
Board by one or more Executive Directors or be 
delegated by the Board in accordance with the Bye-
Laws to the Executive Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors are primarily charged 
with the supervision of the performance of the 
duties of the Directors and assist the Executive 
Directors by providing advice and direction. The 
Non-Executive Directors' duties specifically include 
the supervision of the Executive Directors' 
implementation of the Company's strategy. The 
Board Rules include further detail on the 
implementation of responsibilities and tasks of the 
Non-Executive Directors, amongst others with 
respect to decision-making of the Board on several 
matters, inter alia, nomination of Directors, 
remuneration of Directors and selection and 
nomination of the external auditor.
Chairman & Vice-Chairman
The Board appointed Rudolf Ferscha as Chairman 
and Jan van Kuijk as Vice-Chairman. The Chairman 
shall act as main contact for the Directors regarding 
the functioning of the Board. The Chairman is 
primarily responsible for the functioning of the 
Board and its committees and is responsible for 
ensuring the proper conduct of business at meetings 
of the Board in order to promote a meaningful 
discussing at meetings. As a general rule, the 
Chairman presides over the General Meeting. The 
Vice-Chairman deputizes for the Chairman and is the 
main contact on behalf of the Board regarding the 
Chairman's performance.
Conflicts of interest
In case of a conflict of interest, the Board will 
determine, on a simple majority vote, if a Director's 
interest indeed conflicts with the interests of the 
Company or its business in such a way as described 
in section 24.6 of the Bye-Laws. In 2023, there have 
been no cases of conflicts of interest, transactions 
between the Company and members of the Board, 
or transactions with shareholders holding at least 
10% of the shares of the Company.
Evaluation of the Board
At least annually, the Board shall evaluate – without 
the presence of the Executive Directors – the 
functioning of the Board, the committees and the 
functioning of the individual Directors, shall discuss 
the conclusions of such evaluations, and shall 
identify aspects where the Directors require further 
training or education. 
At least annually, the Executive Directors shall 
evaluate their own functioning. The Executive 
Directors may invite one or more Non-Executive 
Directors to participate in the evaluation or part 
thereof. 
Nomination, Election, Suspension and 
Removal of Directors
Executive Directors
As set out in more detail in our Bye-Laws and Board 
Rules, nominations can be made at any meeting of 
the Shareholders either (i) by the Board or (ii) by 
shareholders, providing these shareholders 3% of the 
Company's outstanding share capital or such lower 
number as is prescribed by the Companies Act. 
Following a nomination by the Board, a Director shall 
be elected by a simple majority of votes cast 
representing more than one-third (1/3) of the then 
outstanding shares that are entitled to vote on the 
matter. If two or more nominees receive the same 
number of votes in favor, the nominee receiving the 
highest percentage of votes in favor shall be elected. 
If equal percentages are cast, no nominee shall be 
elected. Following a nomination by shareholders, a 
Director shall be elected by a simple majority of the 
votes cast, representing at least half (1/2) of the then 
outstanding shares that are entitled to vote on the 
matter. The term of a proposed election shall not 
exceed four years. However, a proposal may provide 
that the term shall expire at the close of the first 
annual meeting of shareholders held after the 
expiration of the four-year term. There is no 
limitation in the duration of an Executive Director's 
entire service. 
In connection with a proposed (re-)election of an 
Executive Director, he or she will need to be 
assessed by the Dutch Central Bank on integrity and 
reputation in view of the qualified interest that Flow 
Traders Ltd. holds in Flow Traders B.V.

The shareholders, on proposal of the Board may 
remove or suspend a Director from office. An 
Executive Director may also be suspended by the 
Board, which suspension shall end if three months in 
aggregate have lapsed without a decision taken on 
the termination of the suspension or removal. In 
case the removal or suspension is resolved on by 
shareholders but not on a proposal of the Board, 
such removal or suspension will require a simple 
majority of the votes cast, representing at least half 
(1/2) of the then outstanding shares that are entitled 
to vote on the matter, unless a Reflection Period is 
invoked. In case the removal or suspension is 
proposed by shareholders or is included on the 
agenda of a general meeting by a competent court, 
the Board may invoke a reflection period as further 
described in the Bye-Laws.
Non-Executive Directors
The nomination, election, suspension and removal 
from office of Non-Executive Directors follow the 
same rules as noted above for Executive Directors, 
with the exception of the following. 
The consecutive term of a Non-Executive Director 
shall expire at the closing of the annual general 
meeting held in the twelfth calendar year after the 
initial election. Following such expiration, a Non-
Executive Director shall not be eligible for re-
election. Such consecutive term shall not apply to 
Non-Executive Directors elected in accordance with 
the nomination right provided for in the Relationship 
Agreement.
Non-Executive Directors may not be suspended by 
the Board without involvement of the shareholders.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors 
Best practice in terms of corporate governance 
prescribes that at most one of the Non-Executive 
Directors on the Board qualifies as a non-
independent and that the total number of non-
independent Non-Executive Directors should 
account for less than half of the total number of 
Non-Executive Directors. Jan van Kuijk and Roger 
Hodenius, as founders of the Company, were 
attracted to their role as Non-Executive Directors 
(former Supervisory Board members) because of 
their specific business-related expertise. They did 
not qualify as independent under the provisions of 
the Corporate Governance Code as they are former 
members of the Management Board of the 
Company, and because they represent shareholders 
of the Company owning an interest of over ten 
percent. As at the date of this report, only Jan van 
Kuijk is still acting as Non-Executive Director on the 
Board. Roger Hodenius decided not to stand for re-
election at the 2023 AGM. As such, the number of 
non-independent Non-Executive Directors on the 
Board amounts to one.
Independence of Committee members
As Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius did not qualify 
as independent Non-Executive Director as set out 
above, this also affected two committees of which 
they were members during (part of) the financial 
year 2023. Best practice in terms of corporate 
governance prescribes that more than half of the 
members of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee should be 
independent. Until the end of Roger Hodenius' term 
of office, both Jan van Kuijk and Roger Hodenius 
were members of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, implying that half (and not more than 
half) of its members were independent.

Board committees
The Board may from time to time establish 
permanent or ad hoc committees. As at the date of 
this report, the Board has established four 
committees: the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee, the Risk

As per 1 January 2024, the former Risk Committee 
was renamed Risk & Sustainability Committee as 
part of a broader exercise to embed the increasing 
importance of ESG related matters into our 
corporate governance processes. The Company 
should have adequate internal risk management and 
control systems in place. The Board is responsible for 
identifying and managing the risks associated with 
the Company’s strategy and activities. The Risk & 
Sustainability Committee's duties include amongst 
others the supervision of the Executive Directors 
with respect to identifying and analyzing the risks 
associated with the strategy and activities of the 
Company and its affiliated enterprise, establishing 
the risk appetite, and putting in place the measures 
in order to counter the risks being taken, designing,

include developing and integrating various 
sustainability topics into the Company’s strategy and 
long-term value creation, including priority-setting 
and sustainability-related KPIs and connected target 
setting. The Risk & Sustainability Committee shall

Risk & Sustainability Committee must be Non-
Executive Directors. More than half of the members 
of the Risk & Sustainability Committee should be 
Independent Directors.
The Board shall appoint one of the members of the 
Risk & Sustainability Committee as chairman of the 
Risk & Sustainability Committee. 
Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee's duties 
include amongst others the review of annual 
investments and expenses on technology, the 
preparation of advice to the Board regarding the 
technology budget, assessing the current state of 
technology in terms of competitiveness and 
functionality, the supervision of the Board on the 
operation of the Company's security systems and 
related risks and reviewing the Company's trading 
activities.

General meeting, 
shares and 
shareholders 
Flow Traders highly encourages shareholder 
participation in the decision-making of the General 
Meeting. It is of great importance to the Company 
that its shareholders have an actual say in the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), and the Company therefore 
encourages an open dialogue. Flow Traders ensures 
that the General Meeting is adequately provided 
with information.
In accordance with the Bye-laws and subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, the Company's 
Board shall convene and the Company shall hold 
General Meetings as Annual General Meetings not 
later than six months after the end of the financial 
year. The Board may, whenever it thinks fit, and 
shall, when requisitioned by shareholders pursuant 
to the provisions of the Companies Act, convene 
General Meetings other than Annual General 
Meetings which shall be called Special General 
Meetings, at such time and place as the Board may 
appoint.
Subject to the Companies Act, a resolution may only 
be moved and put to a vote at a General Meeting if 
(i) it is proposed by or at the direction of the Board, 
(ii) it is proposed at the direction of a competent 
court, (iii) it is proposed on the requisition in writing 
by eligible shareholders, and (iv) the chairman of the 
meeting in their absolute discretion decides that the 
resolution may properly be regarded as within scope 
of the meeting.
Save as otherwise provided in the Bye-laws, at least 
two shareholders present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote on the matter representing the 
holders of at least twenty per cent, or the highest 
amount required from time to time by any stock-
exchange on which any of the shares are listed, of 
the issued share entitled to vote on the matter at 
such meeting shall be a quorum. Increased quorum 
requirements apply for the passing of certain 
resolutions requisitioned by shareholders or the 
resolution to elect, suspend or remove a Director.
Each shareholder present in person at a General 
Meeting shall be entitled to vote on any question to 
be decided on a show of hands or by a count of 
votes received in the form of electronic record 
(including by proxy), and each shareholder present in 
person or by proxy shall be entitled on a poll to vote 
for each share held by them. Each share carries one 
vote at a General Meeting. The AGM is the ideal 
opportunity for shareholders and the Board to 
interact. At an AGM, shareholders can ask questions 
directly to the Board. Our Board strongly encourages 
shareholders to interact.
The 2023 AGM was held on 26 April 2023 at the 
Company's registered address. During this AGM, all 
proposals on the agenda were adopted. The 
proposals adopted by the General Meeting related 
to: the alteration of the bye-laws, the declaration of 
the final dividend, the remuneration report, the 
remuneration policy, the re-election of Rudolf 
Ferscha, the election of Karen Frank, Paul Hilgers 
and Delfin Rueda, the authority to issue shares, the 
authority to exclude or limit preemptive rights,the 
authority to purchase own shares and the re-
appointment of the external auditor.
The Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting 
on 14 September 2023. The sole proposal on the 
agenda was the election of Hermien Smeets-Flier as 
Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director to the 
Board. 99.8% of the votes cast were in favor of such 
proposal.
The Company's next AGM is scheduled to be held on 
13 June 2024. More information will become 
available on our website in due course.
Alteration of the Bye-laws
The Bye-Laws may be revoked or amended only by 
the Board, which may from time to time revoke or 
amend them in any way by a resolution of the Board 
passed by a majority of the Directors then in office 
and eligible to vote on that resolution, but no such 
revocation or amendment shall be operative unless 
and until it is approved at a subsequent general 
meeting of the Company by the Shareholders by 
Resolution passed by a majority of votes cast.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Bye-Laws, the 
Company may only allot or issue shares, or grant 
rights to subscribe for shares (other than treasury 
shares) as authorized by a shareholders’ resolution 
and within the limits of such authorization, which 
authorization cannot be withdrawn, unless 
determined otherwise at the time of the adoption of 
the resolution. 
During the 2023 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Board to issue common shares or to 
grant rights to subscribe for common shares up to 
and including 26 October 2024 for up to ten percent 
(10%) of the total number of shares issued at the 
time of the General Meeting for any purposes. Any 
issuance exceeding this limit needs separate 
approval by the General Meeting.

In addition, the General Meeting renewed the 
authority of the Board to exclude or limit applicable 
preemptive rights when issuing common shares or 
granting rights to subscribe for common shares up 
to and including 26 October 2024.
At our 2024 AGM, the Board intends to request that 
the General Meeting renews its authorization to 
issue common shares or to grant rights to subscribe 
for common shares for up to ten percent (10%) of the 
total number of shares issued at the time of the 2024 
AGM for any purposes.
Purchase and cancellation of shares
The Board may, after prior authorization by 
shareholders’ resolution and within the limits of such 
authorization, authorize the purchase by the 
Company of its own shares upon such terms as the 
Board may in its discretion determine, provided 
always that such purchase is effected in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Acts. Subject 
to the provisions of the Bye-Laws, any shares of the 
Company held by the Company as treasury shares 
shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may hold 
all or any of the shares, dispose of or transfer all or 
any of the shares for cash or other consideration, or 
cancel all or any of the shares
During the 2023 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Board to purchase shares in the 
capital of the Company, either through purchase on 
a stock exchange or otherwise, up to and including 
26 October 2024, under the following conditions: (i) 
the repurchase may constitute up to ten percent 
(10%) of the total number of shares issued at the 
time of the General Meeting, (ii) provided that the 
Company will not hold more shares in treasury than 
ten percent (10%) of the issued share capital and (iii)

Non-Executive Director for election (and

No dedicated take-over protection 
structures
Flow Traders does not employ any of the following 
dedicated take-over protection structures: 
preference shares, depository receipts or call 
options issued to vehicles conducive to protecting 
the Company’s interest or independence.
Compliance with the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code
The Board values and considers the interests of the 
various stakeholders involved. Good corporate 
governance results in effective decision-making in a 
manner which enhances shareholder value and 
enables a Company to maintain a culture of 
integrity, transparency, and trust. The Company has 
a long standing focus on a sustainable long-term 
value creation strategy, culture and risk. As a 
Company governed by Bermudan laws, the Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code is not directly 
applicable to Flow Traders Ltd., however, the Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code continues to be one of 
the guiding resources for Flow Traders Ltd.'s 
corporate governance related practices. As the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code is not directly 
applicable to Flow Traders Ltd., it is not intended 
that Flow Traders Ltd. will report on any possible 
deviations from the Dutch Corporate Governance 
Code.

Board in control statement
The Executive Directors of Flow Traders are 
responsible for the design, implementation and 
functioning of Flow Traders’ internal risk 
management and control systems. Flow Traders’ 
internal risk management and control is a process, 
effectuated by the Executive Directors, senior 
management and other personnel. It is designed to 
mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the achievement of objectives in the 
following categories:
▪
Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
▪
Reliability of financial and non-financial 
information; 
▪
Compliance with laws, regulations and internal 
policies; 
▪
Safeguarding of assets, identification and 
management of liabilities; and
▪
Strategic goals of the Flow Traders Group.
The chapter Risk Management elaborates on Flow 
Traders’ identified financial and non-financial risks 
and how these risks are managed. This chapter 
provides insight into the impact of these risks on 
Flow Traders’ results. The design and functioning of 
the internal risk management and control systems is 
based on the Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF). The framework explained in 
detail in the chapter Risk Management, combines 
various financial and non-financial risk disciplines 
into a single converged approach and provides the 
businesses with an overview on their risks and how 
these are managed. The Risk department assessed 
the controls in this process and the findings have 
been presented to the Executive Directors and Non-
Executive Directors. This allows the Executive 
Directors and senior management to form a view on 
the internal risk management and control systems 
regarding the risks they face while pursuing the 
Board’s strategy.
On the basis of the above and with due observance 
of the limitations stated below, we confirm that to 
the best of our knowledge:
▪
The annual report provides sufficient insights into 
any failings in the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems (see e.g. 
chapter Risk Management);
▪
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial and tax reporting 
does not contain any material inaccuracies (see 
e.g. chapter Financial Statements and Other 
Information);
▪
Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justified that the financial 
reporting is prepared on a going concern basis 
(see e.g. chapters Financial Statements and Other 
Information); and
▪
The report states material risks (if any) and 
uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation 
of the Company’s continuity for the period of 
twelve months after the preparation of the report 
(see e.g. chapters Our Business Strategy and Our 
Risk Management).

It should be noted that the above does not imply 
that these systems and procedures provide absolute 
assurance to Flow Traders as to the realization of 
financial and strategic business objectives, or that 
internal risk management and control systems can 
prevent or detect all misstatements, inaccuracies, 
errors, fraud and noncompliance with legislation, 
rules and regulations.

Message from the Chairman
Dear Stakeholder,
The year 2023 witnessed several transitions within 
our firm from a governance perspective. It was also a 
year with challenging macro-economic 
circumstances for Flow Traders as well as the 
broader industry. Despite these market 
circumstances, we remained focused on driving our 
growth and diversification strategy, as well as on 
expanding our regional presence and product 
coverage to structurally increase the opportunity set 
for our business. On behalf of the entire Board, I 
would like to express our appreciation to all of the 
firm’s employees who have shown excellence, vigor 
and great resilience in successfully navigating 
through a challenging yet defining year for financial 
markets. 
Governance
There were several key changes in the firm’s top 
leadership layers. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to express our 
heartfelt gratitude to Dennis Dijkstra, who had 
served the firm for more than 14 years (of which the 
last nine years as Chief Executive Officer), 
particularly for the energy and determination he 
brought to building and shaping a fast growing 
organization. In February 2023, Mike Kuehnel 
succeeded Dennis as Chief Executive Officer, after 
having served as Chief Financial Officer since 2021. 
Our new Executive Director, Hermien Smeets-Flier, 
succeeded Mike as Chief Financial Officer as per 
September 2023. We would also like to extend our 
gratitude to Folkert Joling, who was instrumental in 
building the firm’s trading capabilities, having 
worked in several trading roles in the firm since 
2006, until he was appointed Chief Trading Officer in 
2018, a position he held until September 2023.
Also, our non-executive bench witnessed transition 
and renewal, with us being grateful for the 
significant contributions Ilonka Jankovich, Olivier 
Bisserier and Roger Hodenius made to the firm’s 
continued success. Roger, as one of Flow Traders’ 
co-founders, had shaped the firm’s entrepreneurial 
spirit and culture and laid the foundations for 
continuous improvement with unwavering drive and 
ambition. He remains connected to the business in 
an advisory role. Olivier had served the firm for 
almost a decade as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, and we all thank him for his tireless and 
insightful leadership in that role. We are also most 
grateful for Ilonka’s highly valuable contributions to 
the Supervisory Board, which benefited from her 
extensive experience in venture capital and in 
developing portfolio companies from a boardroom 
perspective. 
During 2023 we also welcomed the successors to 
our departing non-executive colleagues. In Karen 
Frank, Paul Hilgers and Delfin Rueda we have found 
highly experienced and uniquely capable directors 
with highly complementary competencies. We are 
delighted to have attracted such high caliber 
personalities to help build solid foundations for the 
firm’s next phase of growth.
A key change in the governance framework 
applicable to our firm has come with the completion 
of the update to our corporate holding structure, 
because of which Flow Traders’ top holding 
Company is now a Bermuda based limited Company, 
and the firm’s two tier board structure transitioned 
successfully into a unitary board. It was an 
impressive result to receive such overwhelming 
support from our shareholders for this, with 96% of 
votes cast in favor of the related resolution at the 
Extraordinary General Meeting of December 2022. 
Although, as one consequence, Flow Traders Ltd. 
will not be required to apply the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code going forward, the Code will 
nevertheless continue to be an important point of 
reference for the firm. Furthermore, these changes 
to the corporate holding structure are highly 
relevant to our firm from a strategic standpoint, as 
they enable us to become more competitive as a 
global liquidity provider, particularly in relation to 
regulatory capital management. It has also created a 
more level playing field with our global peers with 
respect to the regulatory capital framework overall 
and is expected to expand and accelerate our firm’s 
growth options. 
Another key highlight in terms of our Company’s 
governance was the approval of our updated 
remuneration policy for the Executive Directors. The 
remuneration policy was approved by a 
supermajority of the Company’s shareholders at our 
2023 Annual General Meeting. This was an important 
governance topic for the firm as it underpins our 
vision with respect to sharing economic success and 
aligning pay structures, including Executive 
Directors’ pay, with the interests of shareholders and 
the Company’s financial performance. 
2023 Business Performance
Within the global trading industry, the year 2023 was 
characterized by significantly subdued volumes and 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023

lower volatility across all asset classes and regions. It 
goes without saying that this overall subdued 
environment impacted our firm’s performance 
throughout the year. The firm endured significant 
headwinds during the year from a macro-economic 
perspective. As a result of the overall decline in 
market activity over the year, we recorded Net 
Trading Income of €300.3 million and Net Profit of 
€36.2 million for the financial year 2023, which was 
well below our financial performance in the prior 
year and well below our aspirations. This challenging 
year has however also provided us with the 
opportunity to further strengthen our business and 
focus on operational excellence and efficiencies as 
well as on additional strategic initiatives.
Strategic Priorities & Initiatives
In addition to strengthening and growing our 
business and retaining our strong market presence 
in ETP trading, our diversification efforts remain a 
top priority to the Board. By way of highlighting just 
a few of these, in February 2023, we opened our 
Chicago office, focusing predominantly on ADR 
trading. The Chicago office will furthermore allow us 
to benefit from the city’s unique talent pool and 
academic diversity. In March 2023, Flow Traders 
London Ltd., a UK based subsidiary, received 
authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority 
which enables us to safeguard our positioning within 
the UK financial system, as well as deepening our 
relationships with UK-based financial institutions. 
Moreover, we have continued to build out our 
trading activities in China in 2023 as a key market 
participant, following the successful receipt of our 
QFII license and the opening of our Shanghai office. 
Furthermore, Flow Traders Strategic Capital 
continued to build strong relationships, with a 
particularly exciting highlight being AllUnity, our 
recently announced partnership with DWS and 
Galaxy Digital. AllUnity will be an emerging 
infrastructure provider, with the mission to launch 
the leading regulated EUR-denominated stablecoin 
to unlock greater institutional adoption of tokenized 
assets. 
Future Outlook
This year we are celebrating the firm’s 20-year 
anniversary, which is a fantastic milestone paying 
testament to the firm’s ongoing success. We will 
continue to be focused on strengthening our trading 
capabilities as well as on further diversifying our 
business. From an asset class point of view, the firm 
is, for instance, very well positioned to capitalize on 
arising opportunities within the digital asset space 
after years of dedicated focus and investments, 
which will further mature in 2024. Examples of this 
include the introduction of MiCAR, the accelerating 
adoption of digital assets by institutions, and the 
acknowledgement of digital assets as a validated 
asset class by regulators including the SEC. 
Furthermore, we will keep focusing on 
systematically strengthening the control layers 
within our firm, which safeguards our credibility 
within global financial markets. Lastly, operational 
and cost efficiencies remain important areas of 
attention as the firm continues to grow and captures 
more opportunities, creating additional strategic and 
operational synergies. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board I would like to thank 
all of our employees for their significant 
contributions in 2023 and am confident that 
together we will make 2024 another successful and 
memorable year for our business.

The Board's focus in 2023
During 2023, the Board held fifteen formal Board 
meetings and met several times without holding a 
formal meeting. Examples of meetings without 
holding a formal meeting include a preparation 
session for the AGM, education and strategy days 
and the self-assessment day. During these meetings 
a variety of topics were discussed, including but not 
limited to the following:
Strategy 
The Board remained focused on (sustainable) long-
term value creation, taking into account the 
strategy’s implementation and feasibility, the 
business model applied by the Company and the 
market in which the Business operates, 
opportunities and risks for the Company, the 
Company’s operational and financial goals and their 
impact on its future position in relevant markets, 
stakeholder interests, and any other aspects relevant 
to the Company and its business, such as the 
environment, social and employee-related matters, 
the chain within which the business operates, 
respect for human rights, and fighting corruption 
and bribery.
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the Company’s risk assessment processes 
and the monitoring of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems continued to be a 
priority and joint responsibility of the Board and all 
committees throughout the year 2023. The review 
amongst others entailed an overview of all relevant 
risks the Company is exposed to, the internal 
controls in place to address these risks, and the 
Board’s views on such risks.
Financial results
The Board was updated on the Company’s financial, 
legal and compliance risks through the Audit 
Committee and the Risk Committee. Other topics 
discussed were the annual, half-yearly and quarterly 
results. 
Off-site
The Board met for a two-day off-site meeting in 
London, United Kingdom. During this off-site, the 
Board extensively discussed the Company’s growth 
strategy and participated in a deep-dive session 
with respect to liquidity and risk management in 
view of the Company’s trading activities.
Remuneration and variable compensation of 
Executive Directors and employees
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee 
updated the Board on remuneration and variable 
compensation plans for both employees and the 
Executive Directors. The Executive Directors did not 
participate in the deliberations and decision-making 
concerning their own remuneration.
The Internal Audit Function
The recommendations of the Internal Audit 
Function, the functioning of the Internal Audit 
Function and the progress of the 2023 Internal Audit 
Plan have been discussed and followed up during 
2023.
Board evaluation
In December 2023, both the Non-Executive 
Directors as well as the Executive Directors self-
evaluated their performance over the year 2023.
The Non-Executive Directors evaluated their own 
functioning and performance as a group as well as 
for the Board’s Committees and for the individual 
Non-Executive Directors. Given that 2023 was the 
first year of the Company operating in a one-tier 
board structure, the board decided for this 
evaluation to be supported by external consultants 
who are subject matter experts in respect of 
Corporate Governance and leadership effectiveness. 
As a result of the conclusions of the 2023 Non-
Executive Director self-assessment, it was agreed to 
increase the interactions between the Non-
Executive Directors and a wider range of people in 
the organization beyond the board’s formal 
meetings. It is intended to proactively create 
additional opportunities for mutual exchange of 
views and for further informal communication, 
particularly taking advantage of in-person presence 
of Non-Executive Directors in different offices 
around official board meetings. The 2023 Non-
Executive Director self-assessment also included an 
independence-assessment which was led by Rudolf 
Ferscha as Chairman of the Board and Linda Hovius 
as Chairwoman of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee. As a result of this independence-
assessment, the Non-Executive Directors re-
confirmed the independence of Rudolf Ferscha, 
Linda Hovius, Delfin Rueda, Paul Hilgers and Karen 
Frank. Jan van Kuijk was considered a non-
independent Director.

## Page 72

The Executive Directors also evaluated their own 
functioning and performance as a group and 
individually, guided by external consultants who are 
subject matter experts in respect of Corporate 
Governance and leadership effectiveness. In this 
context, a 360-degree performance evaluation was 
conducted as well. In the 2023 Executive Director 
self-assessment, the focus was on the CEO and the 
recently joined CFO and it was concluded that the 
capabilities and competencies of the Executive 
Directors are highly complementary to each other. 
Nonetheless, the Executive Directors agreed to 
regularly explore opportunities to increase their 
bench strength by adding to the capability-set of the 
executive team.
Furthermore, the performance of the Executive 
Directors was discussed among the Non-Executive 
Directors, and with each Executive Director 
individually, on at least two separate occasions 
throughout the year. For a detailed overview of the 
performance reviews and the means by which these 
were conducted, reference is made to the 
Remuneration Report as included in this Annual 
Report.

Committees
During the financial year 2023, the Board operated four committees: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, the Trading & Technology 
Committee, and the Risk Committee. For more information on the functioning and on the responsibilities of the committees, please refer to the chapter Governance.
The committees reported to the Board by sharing 
their advice and recommendations during Board 
meetings and by providing an update of the 
deliberations during Board meeting. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee met five times in 2023. Other 
attendees besides the Committee members 
included the CEO, the CFO, the Global Head of 
Finance, the Investor Relations Manager, the Global 
Head of Internal Audit, the Global Head of Tax, the 
Global Head of Compliance and the external auditor.
During these meetings, the Audit Committee 
discussed the annual results, the half-yearly results 
and the quarterly results and shared the items 
discussed with the Supervisory Board. Other topics 
discussed include e.g. significant new and proposed 
legislative initiatives related to accounting, auditing 
and financial reporting, tax planning, tax strategy 
and monitoring, assessing whether there were 
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in 
internal control over financial reporting, the 
Company’s financing strategy and capital 
management policy (including dividend proposals), 
assessing the Company’s compliance with rules and 
regulations, the Company’s Code of Conduct and the 
methods used to assess the effectiveness of the 
internal and external audit processes. Topics 
discussed with the external auditor included the 
financial statements over the financial year 2022, 
recommendations on the basis of the annual report, 
their audit plan for the financial year 2023 and their 
interim review report. The Audit Committee 
reviewed the management letter and 
recommendations included in the auditor’s report, 
as issued by the external auditor and discussed the 
actions taken by management to address any 
recommendations and observations. The Audit 
Committee evaluated the performance of the 
external auditor and discusses this with the Board 
and subsequently with the external auditor. In light 
of this, the Audit Committee advised the Board 
about the reappointment of the external auditor, 
before the Board determined EY's nomination for 
the appointment of the external auditor to the 
General Meeting of 2023. Given the nature of our 
business, the application of information and 
communication technology by the Company, 
including risks relating to cyber security, are 
discussed in detail in the Trading & Technology 
Committee. Subsequently, key items in respect of 
these items are also discussed in the Audit 
Committee.
External auditor
The Audit Committee and the Executive Directors 
reported to the full Board on EY’s functioning as the 
external auditor, the Company’s relationship with 
the external auditor, on its fees, as well as on other 
audit and non-audit services it provided to the 
Company. EY performed a review of the Company’s 
interim financial statements and issued an 
unqualified review report. The Audit Committee 
evaluated the qualifications, performance and 
independence of EY, taking into account the 
opinions of the Executive Directors. The Audit 
Committee also obtained a report from the external 
auditor regarding, among other topics, its internal 
quality control procedures. EY confirmed its 
independence from Flow Traders in accordance with 
the professional standards applicable to it. Based on 
the information provided by the Audit Committee, 
the Board nominated EY as external auditor at the 
Company’s General Meeting in 2023. Subsequently, 
EY was reappointed by the General Meeting as 
external auditor for the financial year 2023.
Internal Audit Function 
The Internal Audit Function (IAF) carried out all 
audits that were due per the 2023 Internal Audit 
plan, as approved by the Supervisory Board of Flow 
Traders N.V. in October 2022. Focus areas in the 
2023 Internal Audit plan included amongst others 
trading, risk management, IT systems and adherence 
to regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee 
and the Global Head of Internal Audit discussed the 
internal audit results from 2023 (findings, 
observations, recommendations, management 
feedback and follow-up). In October 2023, the Board 
approved an updated version of the Internal Audit 
Charter and approved the 2024 (risk-based) Internal 
Audit Plan. The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
maintains regular dialogue with the Global Head of

Remuneration & Appointment Committee
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee met 
six times in 2023. Other attendees to the meetings 
included the CEO and the Global Head of HR & 
Recruitment. During these meetings the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee regularly 
discussed Company culture in general including but 
not limited to the results of the annual employee 
engagement survey and any follow-up actions 
resulting out of such survey. The Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee further discussed the 
Employee Remuneration Policy, made proposals to 
the Board with respect to the the remuneration of 
the individual Executive Directors. The size, 
composition, functioning and succession planning of 
the Board was reviewed including any findings and 
conclusions. Other duties included the monitoring of 
developments in rules and regulations in relation to 
remuneration policies and the preparation of the 
Remuneration Report. Before determining the 
remuneration of the individual Executive Directors , 
the Remuneration & Appointment Committee took 
note of the individual Executive Director’s views with 
regard to the amount and structure of their own 
remuneration.
Trading & Technology Committee
The Trading & Technology Committee met four 
times in 2023. As the core business of the Company 
is discussed in this committee, all of the Non-
executive directors formed part of the Trading & 
Technology Committee. The committee addressed 
trading topics including but not limited to, trading 
performance across all specific asset classes and 
regions including KPI tracking, trading strategies, 
market conditions and capital management. The 
Trading & Technology Committee also addressed 
technology topics, including but not limited to 
technology strategies, information security, and 
developments with respect to rules and regulations 
concerning the Company’s technology operations, 
e.g. the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee met four times in 2023. Invitees 
to the meeting were the Executive Directors and the 
Global Head of Risk and/or the Head of Risk EMEA 
or Head or Risk APAC. The main focus in the 
meetings was the Management Board’s risk 
assessment. The attendees discussed in detail the 
relevant risks the Company is exposed to, the 
internal controls in place to address these risks, the 
Executive Directors’ views on such risks, as well as 
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
internal risk management and control system. More 
information can be found in the chapter 
Governance. 
Non-Executive Directors 
During the year 2023, two meetings were held 
among the Non-Executive Directors, without the 
Executive Directors being present. Both meetings 
related to the profit share allocation to the Executive 
Directors, which, in accordance with the Board Rules 
and the Company’s Remuneration Policy, is a matter 
reserved for the Non-Executive Directors. In January 
2023, the Non-Executive Directors discussed and 
approved the final 2022 profit share allocation to the 
Executive Directors, and in December 2023, the 
Non-Executive Directors discussed the preliminary 
2023 profit share allocation to the Executive 
Directors.
Financial statements and dividend
The 2023 financial statements were prepared by the 
Board. They were discussed with the Audit 
Committee, in attendance of EY. The financial 
statements were audited by EY, who issued an 
unqualified auditor’s report. Reference is made to 
the auditor’s report of the financial statements. The 
Board approved the financial statements as audited 
by EY, including the Company’s dividend proposal. 
We invite the General Meeting to adopt the financial 
statements for 2023 and would recommend casting 
an advisory vote in favor of the 2023 final dividend.
Information on the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors can be found in the chapter Remuneration.

Board composition 
Changes throughout 2023 
The composition of the Board changed on multiple 
occasion during the financial year 2023 as described 
below. Firstly, the composition of the Supervisory 
Board of Flow Traders N.V. (the Company's legal 
predecessor) changed as a result of Ilonka Jankovich 
having resigned from her position as per 13 January 
2023. The composition of the Board of the Company 
changed as a result of Dennis Dijkstra deciding not 
to seek reappointment as Chief Executive Officer 
and Executive Director. Effective 1 February 2023, 
Mike Kuehnel assumed the role of Chief Executive 
Officer. Folkert Joling decided to resign from his 
position as Chief Trading Officer and Executive 
Director with effect from 1 September 2023. 
Hermien Smeets-Flier was elected to the Board as 
Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director as per 
14 September 2023. Finally, the terms of office of 
Olivier Bisserier and Roger Hodenius came to an end 
at the 2023 AGM and both decided not stand for re-
election. Karen Frank, Paul Hilgers and Delfin Rueda 
were elected as (independent) Non-Executive 
Directors at the 2023 AGM.
Rotation Schedule
Any changes in the composition of the Board require 
careful consideration from a succession planning 
perspective. In making nominations to the General 
Meeting of Shareholders for the election of directors 
to the Board, the Board tries to mitigate the 
potential future risk of Directors simultaneously 
retiring. The schedule on the next page is referred to 
as the Board rotation schedule which gives a clear 
insight into each director's term(s). The Board 
rotation schedule is also available on the Company's 
website.
Gender Diversity within the Board, ExCo and 
subtop
We aim to incorporate diversity aspects such as 
nationality, age, gender ,educational background or 
professional background into decision making 
concerning the composition of our workforce. 
Regardless of rules and regulations, we see diversity 
as a means to guarantee a safe and inclusive 
environment for our employees. To the extent 
possible, these aims also apply to the composition of 
our Board. The current composition of the board is 
diverse in terms of gender, nationality and expertise, 
and has a suitable level of experience in the financial, 
economic, trading, technology, social and legal 
aspects of a firm like ours. Specifically with respect 
to gender diversity within the Board, we have set the 
following goals in 2022: (i) to have at least 1/3 female 
and 1/3 male Non-Executive Directors and (ii) at 
least one female and at least one male Executive 
Director.
During the year 2023 we were able to achieve these 
gender diversity goals, as is reflected in the 
following table. We also considerably improved 
gender diversity within the Executive Committee. 
Gender diversity within the subtop (as defined in our 
DE&I Policy, but excluding the members of the 
Board of Directors) is 24% . As 2023 is the first 
reporting year where the subtop was defined for 
Flow Traders Ltd., there are no 2022 comparable 
figures.

Letter from the 
chairwoman of the 
Remuneration & 
Appointment 
Committee
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, I am pleased to present our 2023 
Remuneration Report. This report includes a 
summary of our remuneration policy currently in 
place, as approved at the 2023 AGM, and the 
remuneration paid out in 2023 in accordance with 
this policy. As a result of a thorough legal and capital 
structure review and to support our aims in 
becoming more competitive as a global multi-asset 
liquidity provider, last year we completed an update 
to our corporate holding structure which includes a 
top holding Company in Bermuda. We have retained 
our existing global footprint with no change to day-
to-day operations. This includes a substantial 
presence in the Netherlands as well as maintaining a 
listing on Euronext Amsterdam. This year’s 
remuneration report reflects the reporting 
requirements originating from the updated EU 
Shareholder Rights Directive and the Dutch 
implementation of this Directive.
2023 Main development 
2023 AGM
In 2023, we put forward our revised remuneration 
policy for the Executive Directors and our enhanced 
2022 remuneration report (advisory vote) for the 
AGM’s approval. 76.9% of shareholders voted in favor 
of the remuneration report, which has been a great 
recognition of our efforts in enhancing the 
transparency and clarity of our report. This year’s 
report builds on the steps taken towards enhanced 
transparency and provides enhanced clarity on the 
weighting of our Company (financial and non-
financial) versus individual KPI’s. The revised policy 
for the Executive Directors was approved by 76.01% 
of our shareholders, meaning it obtained the 
required 75% super majority from the AGM. As a 
result, we have now commenced operating under 
the newly approved Remuneration policy, including 
important enhancements such as formally 
introduced share-based compensation, enhanced 
deferral and vesting provisions, share-ownership 
encouragement and a formal cap on compensation.
Leadership changes 
In 2023 we have had a number of leadership 
changes. Firstly, Dennis Dijkstra our former Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) decided not to seek 
reappointment in 2023 as CEO and member of the 
Flow Traders Ltd. In addition, one of our Co-
Founders Roger Hodenius also decided not to seek 
reappointment as Non-Executive member of the 
Board. Mike Kuehnel, until then serving as Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO) has succeeded Dennis and 
became CEO effective 1 February 2023. Following 
Mike’s appointment as CEO. Hermien Smeets-Flier 
joined us from Achmea Investment Management 
and became Executive Director of the Board and 
CFO on Thursday 14 September 2023, through a 
special general meeting during which shareholders 
elected her with a majority of 99.8%. In September, 
Folkert Joling decided to step down as Chief Trading 
Officer and Executive Director of the Flow Traders 
Ltd. Board. At the same time, also a number of other 
appointments were made to the Executive 
Committee, including a newly appointed Global 
Head of Risk and Global Head of Compliance. On 
behalf of the Board and of all Flow Traders 
employees I want to express our gratitude to Dennis, 
Folkert and Roger for their impactful contributions 
to the success of the Company over many years. 
With regard to the composition of the Board, we are 
very happy with our three new Non-Executive 
Directors (Karen Frank, Delfin Rueda and Paul 
Hilgers), who joined the Flow Traders Board in 2023 
bringing a wealth of experience and insights. Delfin 
Rueda took the role of Chair of the Audit Committee 
and Paul Hilgers stepped in as Chair of the Risk 
Committee. 
Organization and culture
Across 2023, the objective of the Board has been to 
expand the broader leadership group across regions 
and functions, to ensure clearer accountability as 
well as increasing alignment. This has been a key 
priority for the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, who have regularly discussed the 
division of roles and responsibilities in order to 
increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Flow 
Traders as well as to create opportunities for 
leadership to grow at different levels in the 
organization. Furthermore, the topic of culture and 
tone at the top is a recurring item on our agenda, as 
is DE&I and employee engagement. Engagement is 
an important element for the development of a 
culture in which employees can flourish and in light 
of the lower 2023 employee engagement scores, we 
have asked the Executive Directors to develop and 
implement a plan to increase employee engagement 
in 2024.

Company performance and remuneration
Flow Traders delivered subdued financial and 
trading performance in 2023 compared to 2022, 
reflecting a less active trading environment. We 
recorded Normalized Total Income in 2023 of €299.8 
million and demonstrated a healthy Normalized 
EBITDA margin of 30.8% with Normalized EBITDA of 
€92.2 million. Ultimately, we posted Normalized Net 
Profit of €59.4 million with Normalized Basic EPS of 
€1.38. This allowed the Company to pay a total 
dividend of €0.45 per share to shareholders, in-line 
with our dividend policy. The Non-Executive 
Directors, in close consultation with, and supported 
by, the Executive Directors have decided that the 
2023 firm-wide variable remuneration pool will be 
€34.7 million (2022: €86.6 million), corresponding to 
32.5% of operating result in 2023.

Flow Traders’ 
remuneration 
philosophy
We believe in operating a single & straightforward 
policy, where we reward all our employees, 
including the Executive Directors, based on the 
same remuneration philosophy and according to 
several defined principles. While we recognize that 
the corporate governance landscape has evolved in 
recent years, we believe that the principles that 
underline our approach remain relevant. The defined 
principles as described below guide the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee when 
making decisions on the remuneration policy and its 
implementation.
Profit sharing
It is in our corporate DNA to share our profits fairly 
with our shareholders and employees, and we have 
done so since we were founded. Given good 
performance employees from any role and office are 
entitled to receive variable remuneration relative to 
their contribution to the firm as a whole. We share 
one singular firm-wide variable remuneration pool. 
The total profit pool available for all employees and 
the Board is 32.5% of operating profit. In addition, we 
have a formal cap on compensation in place for any 
individual Executive Director of the Board where 
compensation is capped at 20 times the average FTE 
total remuneration.
Rewarding for exceptional performance
Our remuneration consists of a relatively modest 
base salary and a variable remuneration component. 
Positive Company performance enables employees 
in any role to receive variable compensation relative 
to their contribution to the firm. The variable 
remuneration profit share is paid out partly in equity 
and directly reflects Company and personal 
performance. The pay-mix is skewed towards 
variable remuneration in good (financial) years. At 
the same time, if we make no profit, we do not pay-
out variable remuneration – and reclaim outstanding 
deferrals if we sustain a loss.
Guarding long-term interests & stimulating 
risk awareness
We align employee pay with the interests of 
shareholders and our financial performance. Where 
Flow Traders is successful, the profits are shared 
with all stakeholders, including our employees. As 
such, variable pay is only possible in a year when a 
profit is made, and a significant part of any profit 
sharing (62.5%) is deferred for a multi-year period 
(up to 4 years) that remains at risk in full during this 
period. The cash component of the profit share vests 
on a pro-rata basis over a two-year period, with the 
first tranche vesting on the date of award. This aligns 
the interests of the Company and its shareholders 
with those of our employees by building long-term 
value and creating ‘skin in the game’ as well as 
continued loyalty. Where Flow Traders is less 
successful, there is a corresponding downwards 
impact on variable remuneration levels creating a 
risk aware culture and creating larger alignment with 
long term growth and reward (as deferred variable 
remuneration remains at risk until vesting).
Emphasizing share ownership
We see the advantages of employee ownership, 
ranging from positive effects on employee 
commitment (attracting and retaining employees), 
corporate innovation, our business performance 
(productivity and profitability as well as 
competitiveness to our peers), through greater work 
effort of employees and a more cooperative and 
entrepreneurial corporate culture.
Social responsibility
The Company and its management believe in being 
a socially responsible Company. Enabling equal 
opportunities and fostering ownership is embraced 
across all areas of how we do business.
Flow Traders’ approach to Executive 
Director remuneration
Our Executive Director remuneration policy aims to 
attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors to 
lead Flow Traders and sustainably execute Flow 
Traders’ strategy. We aim to provide total 
remuneration that is competitive with our 
predominantly international, and in many cases 
privately-owned, competitors and design our 
remuneration structures to encourage our 
employees to stay with us for the longer term. Our 
Executive Director remuneration policy reflects our 
mission, corporate identity and values and fosters 
our unique Flow Traders culture. We provide our 
Executive Directors a remuneration package that 
consists of fixed remuneration and variable 
remuneration. The Executive Directors do not 
receive material ancillary benefits beyond variable 
remuneration. As permitted by the remuneration 
policy, total remuneration of Executive Directors is 
formally capped at a multiple of the average 
employee total remuneration. We present detailed 
insights into our Executive Director remuneration 
policy in the next section.

2023 remuneration for 
the Executive 
Directors of the Board
Introduction
The remuneration (and other arrangements) for the 
Executive Directors are determined by the Non-
Executive Directors of the Board (following 
proposals from the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee). The Non-Executive Directors have 
assessed the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors based on their performance - both 
individual and as a team- and in accordance with 
Company performance in 2023. A detailed 
explanation of the assessment is included in the 
"Performance assessment" section on page 86.
Total remuneration
The table below shows the total remuneration 
awarded to individual Executive Directors in 2023.
▪
Flow Traders delivered a subdued financial and 
trading performance in 2023 compared to 2022, 
reflecting a less active market trading 
environment. We recorded Total Income in 2023 
of €303.9 million and demonstrated a healthy 
EBITDA margin of 22% with EBITDA of €67.5 
million. Ultimately, we posted Net Profit of €36.2 
million with Basic EPS of €0.84.
▪
Despite the trading environment, we continued 
to make progress in terms of executing our 
strategic growth agenda with the further 
expansion of our ETP market making activities in 
Shanghai and Chicago, the growth of our fixed 
income market making capabilities, and the 
broadening and deepening of our digital assets 
footprint with the launch of AllUnity, a Euro-
denominated stablecoin venture with DWS and 
Galaxy Digital.
▪
The subdued financial performance translated to 
a smaller variable remuneration pool in 2023 
compared to 2022. The firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool in 2023 represents 32.5% of 
the operating result, in line with the existing 
remuneration policy.
▪
In line with the proposed cap on total 
remuneration in the 2023 remuneration policy, 
the hard cap on total remuneration for each 
Executive Director in 2023 is €3,032,000. The cap 
is based on average employee total pay of 
€151,600, calculated according to the 
recommendation of the Dutch Monitoring 
Commission.

Base salary
In 2023, we had a few leadership changes. Our 
former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dennis Dijkstra 
decided not to seek reappointment and was 
succeeded by Mike Kuehnel, until then serving as 
Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Succeeding Mike, 
Hermien Smeets-Flier joined us from Achmea 
Investment Management as CFO. Following these 
leadership changes some amendments had to be 
made to the base salaries of the board members, as 
some rebalancing was conducted to be able to 
attract our new CFO externally. Even after the 
rebalancing, the CEO and CFO continue to receive a 
relatively modest annual base salary for the size of 
their role and responsibilities of €300,000. This 
modest base salary remains aligned with our 
Remuneration Philosophy, which heavily relies on 
variable remuneration based on positive Company 
performance.
Variable remuneration
The design of our variable remuneration reflects our 
remuneration principles. We operate a single 
incentive plan that drives and rewards both annual 
and long-term performance with a significant focus 
on the long-term through the multi-year pay-out 
mechanism and half of the award being paid in Flow 
Traders equity. The value of the equity is directly 
linked to performance of the Flow Traders’ share 
price from the date of grant to vesting. Further, any 
outstanding variable remuneration (deferred or 
unvested) remains at risk in full for future years.In 
line with our guiding principles, the Executive 
Directors share in the same firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool as all other employees. This pool 
of variable remuneration is primarily a function of 
operating results. While this structure is uncommon 
among listed companies, it is in line with the 
practice in our industry among both listed and non-
listed peer companies, and necessary to be able to 
attract, retain and motivate individuals of the 
highest caliber.
Executive Directors performance 
assessment
To determine the Executive Directors’ variable 
remuneration awards, the Non-Executive Directors 
conduct a holistic assessment of the performance of 
each Executive Director and the Executive Directors 
as a whole in accordance with a defined scorecard. 
In this holistic performance assessment, the Non-
Executive Directors consider performance against 
Company targets, which have a weight of 70% and 
include both financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs). To ensure a balanced 
assessment, our KPIs do not have pre-determined 
weightings, allowing the Remuneration Committee 
to determine the overall outcome and ensure 
appropriateness in wider circumstances. Objectives 
for the KPIs included in the scorecard are set prior to 
the beginning of the year and where appropriate 
quantitative targets are predefined to ensure the 
assessment is robust. Individual performance is 
assessed alongside Company performance with a 
30% weighting to determine the final variable 
compensation outcomes. Below we present the 
Company KPIs and the explanation on the 
performance assessment as conducted for 2023. 
Total remuneration amounts are formally capped for 
any individual Executive Director of the Board at 20 
times the average FTE total remuneration.

Performance 
assessment
Flow Traders introduced in 2022 a scorecard which 
demonstrates Company performance through six 
specific performance criteria. The criteria were 
chosen to align with our business, our strategy and 
include a range of financial and non-financial 
metrics. During 2023 the same Company 
performance criteria were applied as in 2022, with a 
weighting of 70%. The remaining 30% is based on 
individual performance metrics. Aligned with 2022, 
below we present the measures, targets and actual 
results for 2023 on the defined Company 
performance criteria. 
The criteria were set ahead of the performance 
period, ensuring that the achievement of targets is 
challenging, and were as follows:
1. Median daily net trading income (NTI) 
normalized for volatility:
We believe that the median daily NTI normalized by 
volatility provides a statistically clean picture of 
overall business growth. The distribution of daily NTI 
is not normally distributed but more shaped like a 
Poisson or Gamma distribution with a few negatives 
days and more higher profitability days. Due to the 
fact that the higher profitability days are 
independent, a simple average of daily NTI is 
statistically less relevant than the median of the daily 
NTI. It is Flow Traders’ ambition to increase this 
median NTI for equal volatility scenarios. Therefore, 
it is necessary to normalize the observed daily NTI by 
the volatility. Since volatility does not have a linear 
effect, but a moderately exponential impact, it has 
been determined that the most appropriate 
calculation option is to divide the daily median NTI 
by the square root of the volatility. This exercise has 
been performed on our historical results and the 
average VIX value has been used to normalize the 
NTI. It is important to note that for a business with a 
global footprint which is exposed to multiple 
different asset classes, VIX is a simplified proxy for 
overall volatility (VIX is the implied volatility of the 
S&P500). However, it does provide a measure of 
general market sentiment. 
The target value set by the Company is to have this 
metric increase by 10 points every year which equals 
an increase of approximately €50,000 per trading 
day. The target for this metric was set at 237 for 
2023 and we achieved an actual result of 234.
2. Normalized EBITDA margin 
Normalized EBITDA margin is a profitability ratio that 
measures how much in earnings a Company is 
generating before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortization, as a percentage of the Total Income. 
Normalized EBITDA and margin are based on the 
relevant profit share percentage of operating result 
for the relevant financial period without any IFRS 2 
adjustments for share-based payments. 
On the cost side, Normalized fixed operating 
expenses increased to €174.1 million in 2023 (2022: 
€161.6 million). The main drivers of the increase in 
fixed expenses related to the base salary adjustment 
conducted in Q2 2022 across the Company, 
continued technology investment, and general price 
inflation reflected across all expenses categorizes at 
year end decreased by 2.1% percent to 646. 
Normalized variable employee expenses decreased 
to €33.5 million (2022: €90.8 million) which reflects 
the less favorable financial performance of the 
business during the year and the adjusted profit 
sharing percentage of 32.5% which was 
implemented the previous year to ensure the base 
compensation increases were income statement 
neutral.
A target Normalized EBITDA of 40% was set for 2023. 
This is reflective of prior annual outcomes and is at a 
level which ensures a sustainable and growing 
business for all internal and external stakeholders. 
Flow Traders delivered a Normalized EBITDA margin 
of 30.8% (2022: 45.2%) with Normalized EBITDA of 
€92.2 million (2022: €208.2 million) which was the 
result of the income and cost dynamics described 
above. 
3. Average return on shareholders' equity
The average return on shareholders' equity shows 
how much money is returned to our shareholders as 
a percentage of the money that has been invested 
or retained in Flow Traders. It is calculated by 
dividing Flow Traders normalized net profit for the 
year by the average total shareholders' equity for the 
year (i.e. the average of the opening and closing 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023   
 
 
 
 
 
86


---

## Page 87

shareholders' equity balances, expressed as a 
percentage). 
In 2023, Flow Traders recorded average return on 
equity of 10.0% reflecting normalized net profit of 
€59.4 million and average shareholders' equity of 
€596.1 million. This compares to 27.0% average 
return on shareholders' equity delivered in 2022. The 
realization of a 10.0% average return on equity is the 
result of a lower NTI performance during the year as 
well as the operating expenses dynamics which 
reflect both fixed operating expenses as well as 
variable employee remuneration which is 
determined by the 32.5% profit share arrangement. 
The target average return on shareholders' equity for 
2023 was set at  20% which is an approximation of 
Flow Traders’ cost of equity and steers towards 
delivering a return on shareholders' equity that is 
greater than the Company’s cost of equity.
4. Business development 
It is an ongoing goal of the Company to further grow 
and diversify our trading activities each year, 
particularly in the context of the broader market 
volumes. We revised the business development KPI 
this year to more closely align with the Company’s 
stated growth and diversification agenda, now with 
four components contributing to this KPI. An 
important component of our trading is off-exchange 
with institutional counterparties and the value 
traded per active counterparty help measures the 
development in this area. As we diversify our trading 
into different asset classes, the Net Trading Income 
we derive from Fixed Income and CCC as a portion 
of total Net Trading Income measures the growing 
diversification of the business. In a similar vein, the 
Net Trading Income we derive from the Americas 
and Asia as a portion of total Net Trading Income 
measures the growth of the business outside of our 
core European market. And lastly, our own ETP value 
traded compared to the market ETP value traded 
measures our share of the overall market. 
This business development score provides a relative 
score based on an algorithm comprised of several 
input levers including the number of active 
counterparties, off-exchange value traded, our Net 
Trading Income by asset class and by region, our 
own ETP value traded and total market ETP value 
traded. At the end of 2023, Flow Traders had 1,183 
active counterparties and off-exchange value traded 
amounted to €511 billion for the year. Fixed Income 
and CCC accounted for 47% of total NTI and the 
Americas and Asia accounted for 46% of total NTI. 
Flow Traders ETP value traded amounted to €1,464 
billion and market ETP value traded amounted to 
€42,997 billion.
Given these inputs and developments, Flow Traders 
scored 1.70 in 2023 in this KPI, compared to the 2023 
target and 2022 score of 1.61.
5. Compliance awareness score 
The metric represents incidents that Compliance 
was made aware of on a timely basis that resulted in 
further action (e.g., document, escalation, and or 
remedial measures) and categorized by level of 
materiality.
Incident management was successful overall; issues 
were identified and escalated through transparent 
channels. Opportunities remain for improvement 
with respect to implementing cross-departmental 
enhancements and structural solutions rather than 
ad hoc improvements.
Flow Traders achieved a 100% outcome with respect 
to its compliance awareness score which is in line 
with the 2023 target set for the executives. All 
incidents were reported on a timely basis and Flow 
Traders relies on the procedures and training of the 
Compliance team to ensure any breach of 
obligations are sufficiently escalated and acted 
upon.
6. Engagement score 
This is the average score given by our employees in 
response to the main engagement question in our 
annual global employee engagement survey. 
Engagement is a measure of how committed and 
enthusiastic employees are about their work and the 
organization. When people are engaged, they feel 
more comfortable being themselves at work. 
Different factors contribute to employee 
engagement, including organizational culture, work 
environment, work relationships, and development 
opportunities.
On the engagement score, a 7.0 was scored, this is 
9% below the Company target of 7.7 for 2023. We do 
see it as our goal to increase the score vs the 
benchmark next year.
2023 performance summary
The performance on the Company scorecard in 
combination with the Executive Directors’ individual 
performance have determined the individual 
variable compensation outcome. The weighting of 
the Company performance measures is 70%, while 
the individual measures attain to 30%. As mentioned, 
our KPIs do not have further pre-determined 
weightings, allowing the Remuneration and 
Nomination Committee to determine the overall 
outcome and ensure appropriateness in overall 
circumstances. Despite 2023 being a challenging 
year due to the subdued market trading 
environment, still the target levels were achieved 
and exceeded on our Business development index 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023

and Compliance Awareness score performance 
metrics. 
While the results of the Median daily net trading 
income, EBITDA margin, Return on shareholders' 
equity, and Engagement score measures came in 
below target, performance on these metrics was still 
viewed to be in the acceptable range and the 
rationale for not reaching the targets has been 
understood given the market circumstances. In 
addition to the Company performance metrics, the 
individual performance for the CEO and CFO was 
also considered in setting the variable remuneration 
levels. 
In addition to a lower total variable remuneration 
pool being available in 2023 when compared to 
2022, also a lower portion of this has been awarded 
to the executives as a result of the performance 
assessment, measured against the aforementioned 
Company and individual performance criteria. As 
such we believe the variable compensation 
determined is set at a justified level. Aligned with 
our remuneration philosophy and our aim of long-
term value creation, the variable compensation is 
partly paid out in equity deferred over multiple 
years.
2024 scorecard
The Non-Executive Directors of the Board have 
determined that the six KPIs used to assess 
Executive Director performance in 2023 will be 
retained for the 2024 performance year. The specific 
targets relating to each of these KPIs are 
commercially sensitive and accordingly the target 
ranges and actual performance outcomes achieved 
will be disclosed retrospectively together with 
appropriate commentary in the next annual report. 
The weighting of the Company versus individual 
targets will remain at 70% versus 30%.

Deferral and vesting of variable pay
We believe in creating a culture of ownership, risk awareness and entrepreneurial 
spirit and we embrace an approach which truly connects our people to the 
business in sharing profit and risk. To ensure that the variable remuneration 
award of the Executive Directors is aligned with our beliefs and contributes to 
long-term value creation and shareholder experience, 50% of the 2023 award to 
the Executive Directors is paid out in equity deferred over multiple years. This 
approach allows us to take a longer-term outlook on remuneration. The value of 
these instruments is directly linked to performance of the Flow Traders’ share 
price from the date of grant to vesting. Further, any outstanding variable 
remuneration (deferred or unvested) remains at risk in full for future years. All 
equity-based awards are subject to a holding period of one-year post-vesting. 
The remaining 50% is settled in cash, paid in equal installments in 2024 and 2025. 
The above approach accords with our culture and remuneration philosophy of 
encouraging management and employee share ownership, creating alignment 
with the Company’s long-term success.

Comparative overview of Company 
performance and remuneration
The long-standing foundation of our remuneration 
policy reflects a relatively modest base salary and 
variable remuneration that is aligned with Company 
performance – which varies each year depending on 
successful or less successful (financial) years. This is 
clearly illustrated in the table below which shows 
the development of the Company performance and 
the awarded (full-time) remuneration of executives 
and average employee remuneration over the last 5 
years. 
Internal pay ratios
The 2023 pay ratio (CEO total pay vs average total 
employee pay) is 4.33 compared to 7.61 in 2022. This 
is well below the cap of 20 times average total 
employee pay.

Scenario analyses 
The Board carries out yearly scenario analyses when 
determining the structure and level of Executive 
Director remuneration outcomes, in accordance 
with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. This 
includes the calculation of remuneration under 
different scenarios, whereby different performance 
assumptions are considered. By considering 
different performance assumptions, the possible 
outcomes of variable components and the resulting 
impact on the total remuneration of the Executive 
Directors is understood and examined. The Board 
believes the current remuneration structure and 
outcomes are appropriate and aligned with 
shareholder experiences. The Board will continue to 
assess the adequacy of the remuneration structure, 
including performance measures used for variable 
remuneration components.
No pensions, loans and other benefits
In 2023, no personal loans, guarantees or related 
benefits were granted by the Company to the 
members of the Board as part of their compensation 
package. No loans, guarantees or similar instruments 
to the members of the Board were outstanding on 31 
December 2023.
We have not reserved nor accrued any amounts to 
cover pension claims or retirement claims. We do 
not provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
member of the Board.
Clawback variable remuneration
Malus and clawback provisions are in place that are 
comprehensive, irreversible and substantially exceed 
regulatory requirements. No variable remuneration 
has been clawed back during 2023.
Temporary deviations from the 
remuneration policies
No temporary deviations took place from the 
respective policies in 2023.
Shares held by employees and Executive 
Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, 
creating alignment between the Company’s long 
term success and individual personal financial 
circumstances. Since IPO, we have utilized a number 
of share schemes. In connection with the IPO a 
significant number of current and former employees 
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow 
Traders Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and Flow Traders 
Loyalty Incentive Plan (FLIP) were introduced. The 
FCIP was replaced in 2020 by a new share plan 
which provides for the award up to 50% of variable 
remuneration in shares (or share-like instruments).

No variable remuneration shares, pensions, 
loans and other benefits
The Non-Executive Directors did not receive variable 
remuneration for their work as Board member or any 
share-based remuneration, and no personal loans, 
guarantees or equivalent benefits were granted by 
the Company to the Non-Executive Directors as part 
of their compensation package. We have not 
reserved nor accrued any amounts to cover pension 
claims or retirement claims. We do not provide any 
other ancillary benefits for any Non-Executive 
Director.

Remuneration for other employees
Variable Remuneration
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the 
beginning of each calendar year, clear objectives are 
set depending on an employee’s role, which are in 
line with our Company objectives for the year and 
our corporate key competencies: drive, 
entrepreneurship and teamwork. Performance is 
reviewed twice during an annual cycle. Individual 
variable remuneration payable from the collective 
variable compensation pool is dependent on 
Company and business unit performance, individual 
performance and the individual’s contribution to the 
long-term success of the Company as a whole, 
discouraging a culture of ‘star’ behavior and 
fostering collaboration and teamwork. Flow Traders 
does not base variable remuneration directly on 
financial results achieved individually. The Non-
Executive directors approve the awarding of variable 
remuneration. If awarded, variable remuneration is 
paid in cash, Company shares and Company share 
like instruments in one to multiple annual 
installments, depending on the amount of variable 
remuneration awarded. The deferred variable 
component acts as a first loss tranche to 
compensate for any operating loss in the 
subsequent year, acting as a buffer before such loss 
would impact shareholder equity. This serves as an 
important incentive for risk-aware behavior, 
focusing on the long-term objectives of the 
Company and alignment with our risk appetite. We 
deem the deferral period sufficient given the 
Company’s risk profile and horizon, see for further 
details of our remuneration philosophy on page 81.
▪
Variable remuneration components may become 
subject to reduction or claw back if it is 
determined that the relevant employee did not 
meet adequate norms of competence and 
appropriate behavior or was responsible for 
behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of 
the Company’s position, in accordance with

Emphasizing share ownership
Flow Traders values ownership, both in terms of 
mindset, behavior as well as a share in the 
ownership of the Company. We believe that being a 
shareholder aligns the interests of the Company with 
those of our employees. Ever since the Company 
went public and before, we have a history of offering 
our employees the opportunity to become 
shareholders. From 2017 until 2019, we promoted 
shareholding through the Flow Cash Incentive Plan 
(FCIP). From performance year 2020 onwards, we 
have begun rewarding employees directly in 
Company shares. The higher the variable 
remuneration an individual receives, the higher the 
proportion of variable compensation paid out in 
shares.
We are also maintaining our FLIP (Flow Loyalty 
Incentive Plan) program, whereby we award 
Company shares to employees marking their two 
year anniversary with the Company. Shares awarded 
under the FLIP are subject to a lock-up period. All 
shares awarded to employees are fully paid out from 
the variable compensation pool. The terms and 
conditions of the employee share plans are subject 
to review by the Executive Directors annually. As a 
part of these plans, shares have been and will be 
bought in the market.
Pension
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. 
At our headquarters in Amsterdam, we partner with 
a pension provider, giving employees the freedom of 
choice to select the option that best suits their 
individual needs while incentivizing participation in 
the Company-sponsored program. In our other 
offices we offer schemes that are driven by country 
specific practices and regulations.
Variable compensation granted
In 2023, the total amount of variable remuneration 
awarded to all employees including the Executive 
Directors was €34.7 million (2022: €86.6 million). 
In 2023, Company wide average compensation 
(includes salary, social security costs and variable 
remuneration) paid per average FTE was €151.6K 
(2022: €235.9K), while variable remuneration per 
average FTE amounted to 33.8% (2022: 57.2%) of 
total compensation in 2023. This excludes any 
Executive Director remuneration.

Flow Traders 
Academy
At Flow Traders we are passionate about creating an 
international, diverse, and empowering culture, 
which encompasses four core values: teamwork, 
entrepreneurship, responsibly and drive.
We are continuously focused on empowering our 
employees in their personal and professional 
growth. We aim to equip employees with essential 
skills and knowledge for their roles, and continuously 
foster their talents.
Flow Traders Academy
To achieve this, we established a dedicated Flow 
Traders Academy, which provides tailored 
onboarding programs, offers various soft and hard 
skills training opportunities, and facilitates internal 
knowledge- sharing.
Over the past years, the Academy has structurally 
enriched the training opportunities and learning 
culture at Flow Traders to maximize our employees’ 
potential. We have created internal training 
programs to help employees improve their business 
knowledge and in 2023, we introduced a 
consolidated training offering which aligns with our 
global capability frameworks and focus on 
developing the soft skills of our employees in each 
level of the framework. These initiatives help 
employees create and realize clearer growth paths 
and help them in further former their own 
development journey within the Company. Essential 
areas covered in the offerings are, but not limited to, 
business knowledge and skills, behavioral skills/
competencies, and leadership skills.
Graduates and interns
Interns and recent graduates are a key talent pool  
for Flow Traders. Graduates and interns bring 
enthusiasm, eagerness to learn and energy which 
are key ingredients for high potentials within Flow 
Traders. Next to this, they bring diversity (we hire 
more than 25% of global nationalities at Flow 
Traders, and the graduates are an important group 
for our long-term succession planning).
Therefore, we have expanded our existing Graduate 
Development and Internship Programs facilitated in 
our Amsterdam and New York locations with a new 
Graduate Developer Program in our Cluj office as 
well as a Trading Internship Program in our Hong 
Kong office.
As a technology enabled firm, we also facilitate 
opportunities for talent in technology. After 
successfully launching the Graduate Software 
Development Program in our Amsterdam office, we 
have seen the positive result. Many of our talented 
developers started as a graduate within the Product 
Development department.
Across all our Graduate Programs, participants 
receive continuous support from dedicated mentors 
and team leads in their personal and professional 
development. During the internship, students work 
closely with our Traders and Quantitative 
Researchers, and they add value by working on real 
trading projects.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
1. Reporting entity
Flow Traders Ltd. (referred to as the “Company”) is an exempted Company 
limited by shares registered under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as 
amended (the “Companies Act”). Flow Traders Ltd. was incorporated on 13 
January 2023 with its registered office at Canon's Court, 22 Victoria Street, PO 
Box HM 179, Hamilton HM 12 Bermuda. The Company's principal place of 
business is located at Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 1018 LL Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands. Flow Traders Ltd. is registered with the Dutch Trade Register of 
the Chamber of Commerce under number 88926257 as a company formally 
registered abroad (“formeel buitenlandse kapitaalvennootschap”). This term is 
referred to in the Dutch Companies Formally Registered Abroad Act (“Wet op de 
formeel buitenlandse vennootschappen”), which means the Company is 
deemed a Dutch resident company for corporate reporting purposes in 
accordance with applicable Dutch laws.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). Prior to 13 January 2023, the 
Group's ultimate parent was Flow Traders N.V. As of 13 January 2023, Flow 
Traders N.V. had been legally merged via a cross border legal merger into Flow 
Traders S.A.; following this merger Flow Traders S.A. converted into a Bermuda 
limited company, Flow Traders Ltd. Flow Traders Ltd. is the legal successor and 
reporting entity of Flow Traders N.V. and the Group's ultimate parent.
The Group is a leading technology-enabled global multi-asset class liquidity 
provider with its core business in Exchange Traded Products (ETP) actively 
expanding in fixed income, FX, commodities and digital assets, while 
systemically increasing its presence in the global ecosystem through strategic 
partnerships and investments.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 
December 2023 incorporate financial information of Flow Traders Ltd., its 
subsidiaries and associates. The annual financial statements were authorized for 
issue by the Company’s Board on 29 February 2024 subject to adoption by the 
general meeting of shareholders.
2. Predecessor and continuation accounting
a) Changes to corporate structure
On 13 January 2023, the Group completed the update to its corporate holding 
structure. This followed receipt of shareholder approval at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting held on 2 December 2022 and fulfillment of all regulatory and 
other customary closing conditions. As a result of the update, the Group’s top 
holding company is now Flow Traders Ltd. The update of the corporate holding 
structure enables Flow Traders to become more competitive as a global liquidity 
provider, particularly in relation to regulatory capital management. 
As part of the change of its corporate holding structure Flow Traders N.V. 
entered into a cross-border legal merger in which (i) all Flow Traders N.V.'s 
assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and other legal relationships were acquired 
by Flow Traders S.A. incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, (ii) Flow 
Traders N.V. ceased to exist and (iii) each Shareholder received one Flow Traders 
S.A. share for each Flow Traders N.V. share. Following this merger Flow Traders 
S.A. converted into a Bermuda limited company and changed its registered 
address to Bermuda. 
The change in the Group's corporate holding structure had no impact on the 
profit and loss or equity of the Company. A predecessor value method is used to 
determine the carrying value of all assets and liabilities that transfer as part of 
the merger. As at 13 January 2023 the assets and liabilities of Flow Traders N.V. 
are consolidated in the financial statements of Flow Traders S.A. at their 
carrying amount on this date, in accordance with the predecessor value 
method. Similarly for comparative numbers, amounts are presented as if the 
combination had taken place at the beginning of the earliest comparative 
period presented, being years 2023 and 2022. 
The pooling of interests method is generally considered to involve the 
combining parties being presented as if they had always been combined. To this 
effect, the receiving entity accounts for the transaction from the beginning of 
the period in which the combination occurs (irrespective of its actual date) and 
presented comparatives to include all combining parties.
b) Capital management
Different capital requirements apply following the update of the holding 
structure which are expected to expand Flow Traders' strategic growth options.

Furthermore, it creates a more level playing field with global peers with respect 
to the regulatory capital framework. Flow Traders’ regulated entities continue to 
be subject to supervision by their respective regulators, however Flow Traders 
will no longer be subject to consolidated IFR/IFD supervision. Flow Traders 
obtained an unconditional declaration of no objection from the Dutch Central 
Bank (DNB) in connection with the update of the corporate holding structure.
c) Common control
As Flow Traders N.V. and Flow Traders S.A. are under common control at the 
time they entered into the cross-border legal merger, IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations is not applicable.
3. Basis of preparation 
a) Statement of compliance
The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (‘IFRS-EU’) and title 9 book 2 of Dutch Civil Code. IFRS-EU 
provides several options in accounting principles. The Group’s accounting 
principles IFRS-EU and its decisions regarding the options available are set out 
in the section ‘material accounting policies’ below.
b) Going concern basis of accounting
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the 
going concern assumption.
c) Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also 
the functional currency of the parent company, Flow Traders Ltd. All financial 
information presented in euros has been rounded to the nearest thousand, 
except when otherwise indicated.
d) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of these consolidate financial statements requires management 
to form opinions and make estimates and assumptions that influence the 
reported value of assets and liabilities and of income and expenditure. The 
actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Information about estimates and judgements made in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes; 
▪
Note 7: Fair value measurement
▪
Note 12: Share based payments 
▪
Note 31: Provisions and contingencies
The accounting treatment of digital assets and the blockchain industry have not 
yet been specifically addressed by IFRS guidance. If specific guidance is enacted 
in the future, the impact may result in changes to the Group's financial position.
e) Principles for the preparation of the consolidated statement of 
cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities are presented in the consolidated 
statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Cash flows from investing 
activities and financing activities are presented in the consolidated statement of 
cash flows using the direct method.
The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, trading activities, 
investment activities and financing activities. Receivables from and payables to 
clearing organizations are included in the cash flow from operating activities. 
The Group has elected to classify interest received and interest paid (including 
interest on lease liabilities and interest arising from revenue contracts, if there is 
any) as cash flows from operating activities.
The Group has elected to classify interest received and interest paid as cash 
flows from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of 
acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments other 
than in the course of operations, as well as acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries 
and associates, property and equipment. Financing activities include the 
payment of dividend to shareholders, the (re)-purchase of shares, the issuance 
and repayment of financial debt, including financial lease liabilities, and capital 
contributions.
f) Change in accounting 
In the prior year, trading receivables and trading payables were designated at 
fair value through profit or loss. In the current year, it has been determined that 
they do not meet the criteria for that designation resulting in a change in 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023   
 
 
 
 
 
103

## Page 104

accounting  to classify these assets and liabilities at amortized cost. Due to the 
short-term nature of these assets and liabilities, their carrying amount is a 
reasonable approximation of fair value. As such, there was nil impact in the prior 
year and amounts. 
4. Material accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to 
all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
a) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group 
entities. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and 
expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions 
with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in 
the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an 
investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through power over 
the investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences 
until the date when control ceases.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary it derecognizes the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other 
components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when 
control is lost.
Equity-accounted investees
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but 
not control or joint control, over its financial and operating activities. A joint 
venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the 
Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its 
assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Interests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method and are recognized initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or 
loss and OCI of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant 
influence or joint control ceases. 
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the 
date control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the 
acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain 
purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are 
expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or equity 
securities.Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Any gain or loss resulting from the fair value remeasurement of contingent 
consideration is recognized in profit or loss.
b) Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of 
the respective entities of the Group at exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the 
foreign currency difference being recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising 
on the translation of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income unless 
the instrument is impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items in a foreign currency that are measured based on historical cost are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023

## Page 105

Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates 
at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated to euros at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, 
and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of 
equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant 
influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation 
reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of 
the gain or loss on disposal.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with 
maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Group in 
the management of its short-term commitments.
d) Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are 
originated. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and 
sales of financial assets) are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on 
which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or 
minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
▪
trading receivables, measured at amortized cost;
▪
investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;
▪
investments measured at fair value through profit and loss;
▪
financial assets held for trading at fair value through profit and loss; and
▪
other financial assets at amortized costs.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and 
loan commitments, into the following categories:
▪
trading payables, measured at amortized cost;
▪
financial liabilities held for trading at fair value through profit or loss; and
▪
other financial liabilities measured at amortized costs.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the Group 
acquires or incurs principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the 
near term, or holds as part of a portfolio that is managed together for short-
term profit.
Trading assets and liabilities are initially recognized and subsequently measured 
at fair value in the statement of financial position, with transaction costs 
recognized in profit or loss. All changes in fair value are recognized as part of net 
trading income in profit or loss. Trading assets and liabilities are not reclassified 
subsequent to their initial recognition.
Trading receivables and payables
Such assets and liabilities are recognized initially at fair value minus/plus any 
directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these assets and liabilities 
are measured at amortized cost.
Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income ('OCI')
Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
non-derivative equity investments that the Group considers long-term strategic 
investments. Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in 
other comprehensive income as part of the change in fair value at the next 
remeasurement. They are never reclassified into profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair 
value reserve in equity. When an investment is derecognized, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit or loss.
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023

## Page 106

Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss ('PL')
Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss are non-derivative 
equity investments that the Group holds for long term trading purposes. 
Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss are recognized 
initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in the profit and loss as 
part of the change in fair value, any re-measurement of the investments is 
classified to profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein, are recognized in profit and loss. When an investment is derecognized, 
the gain or loss is classified to profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value less any 
directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these 
financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method. The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign 
exchange risk associated with its capital contributions to the United States and 
Singapore subsidiaries. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the 
effective portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI while any gains or losses 
relating to the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of profit or 
loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such 
gains or losses recorded in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or 
loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of 
offset is agreed between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a 
net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under 
IFRS-EU, for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as 
in the Group’s trading activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants at 
the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most 
advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value 
of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an 
active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions 
for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to 
provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition 
is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or 
received. If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs 
from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted 
price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a 
valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the 
financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the 
difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. 
Subsequently, that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate 
basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is 
wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on estimated prices whereby 
the price differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those 
estimated prices can differ from quoted market prices. The Group’s risk and 
mid-office department monitors whether all differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the 
Group on the basis of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are 
measured on the basis of a price that would be received to sell a net long 
position or paid to transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure. 
Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.

The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of 
the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e) Other assets held for trading
Other assets held for trading comprise the amount of digital assets that the 
Group holds as a broker-trader. The Group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets and 
these are measured at fair value less cost to sell with changes in value 
recognized profit and loss. 
For the determination of the fair value, the Group collects reference price points 
on an on-going basis from multiple crypto exchanges and active markets. If 
assets are not actively traded the valuation is based upon quoted prices or 
observable inputs from similar assets.
f) Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When parts of an item 
of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as 
the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying 
amount of the item) is recognized in other income in profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
Ongoing repairs and maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in 
profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of each component. 
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant 
items of property and equipment are as follows:
▪
hardware: 5 years;
▪
office fixtures: 5 years;
▪
other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the 
lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets 
are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-
of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized less any lease 
incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease 
term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Right-of-use assets are 
recorded in property and equipment and intangible assets on the statement of 
financial position.
g) Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the 
estimated useful lives of each component. The estimated useful life of 
significant intangible assets is 5 years.
h) Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and 
other debt financial assets not held at fair value through profit and loss is based 
on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime 
expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in 
credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 
months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). 
For other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating 
ECLs as these receivables relate to operating activities of the Group. Therefore, 
the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has 
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss

experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment. 
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 
90 days past due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a 
financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicated 
that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full 
before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A 
financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovering the contractual cash flows.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred 
tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized if the 
carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and 
its fair value less cost of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets 
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which 
impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized 
in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by 
comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. 
An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there has 
been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount.
i)
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under 
short-term cash variable compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
j)
Share based payments
The fair value of equity-settled transactions granted to employees is 
determined by the fair value of the shares at the date when the grant is made. 
When employees render services as consideration for equity instruments, the 
expense is recognized in employee expenses, together with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period in which the service conditions are fulfilled 
(the vesting period). The awards vest in tranches on various dates over a total 
period of up to five years. Graded vesting is applied where needed. Vesting is 
conditional upon the employee being actively employed by the Group on the 
vesting date. If the employee is terminated or resigns, any unvested tranches of 
the award will be forfeited. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or 
credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period. 
Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the 
conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023   
 
 
 
 
 
108


---

## Page 109

number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance 
conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions 
attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are 
considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected 
in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award 
unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is 
recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards 
include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as 
vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
The fair value of share appreciation rights (SARs) granted to employees, which 
are cash-settled, is recognized in employee expenses, together with a 
corresponding increase in other liabilities, over the period during which the 
service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The liability is remeasured at 
the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes 
in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Estimates used are reassessed at the 
end of each reporting period.
k) Other liabilities held for trading 
As part of its trading activities, the Company enters into digital asset payables. 
The borrowed digital assets payables are measured at fair value through profit 
or loss.
l)
Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
recognized as finance cost. 
m) Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities 
on the statement of financial position measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present value of 
lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date. After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the 
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a change in the lease term or in case of other 
reassessments or modifications. 
n) Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial 
expenses related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and 
are therefore directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading 
income.
o) Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax 
are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to a business 
combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive 
income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or 
loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of 
previous years. Current tax payable also includes any withholding tax liability 
arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
their tax bases. Deferred tax is not recognized for:
▪
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
▪
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in 
the foreseeable future; and
▪
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023

## Page 110

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to 
temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into 
account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and 
interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are 
adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, 
including interpretations of tax law and management judgement. This 
assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgement 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause 
the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax 
liabilities or the collectability of tax assets. Such changes will impact tax 
expense in the period that such a change in estimate is made. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the 
same tax authority on the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis or the tax assets and liabilities will be realized 
simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and 
deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
p) Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
recognized at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized in 
profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own 
equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the 
consideration, if reissued, is recognized in the share premium.
5. New standards and interpretations 
All accounting policies are the same as those applied in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2022. In 
addition to the policies disclosed as part of the financial statements for the year 
ending 31 December 2023, Flow Traders has applied its accounting policy with 
respect to predecessor and continuation accounting as outlined in note 2. 
New amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2023, but do 
not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group. Additionally, the accounting standards issued but not yet effective 
related to IAS 1 and IFRS 16 will not have a material effect on the Group. 
a) Material accounting policy information
The Group also adopted Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 
and IFRS Practice Statement 2) from 1 January 2023. Although the amendments 
did not result in any changes to the accounting policies themselves, they 
impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial 
statements. 
The amendments require the disclosure of 'material', rather than 'significant' 
accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on the application 
of materiality to disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities to provide 
useful, entity specific accounting policy information that users need to 
understand other information in the financial statements. 
The following policies were previously disclosed as significant accounting 
policies but have been removed from the financial statements as they were not 
considered material accounting policies under the amended IAS 1: 
▪
Business combinations
▪
Goodwill
▪
Non-current assets held for sale
a) Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single 
transaction
The Group has adopted Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising 
from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) from 1 January 2023. The 
Group had not previous taken the initial recognition exemption and, therefore, 
there was no impact on the statement of financial position or to opening 
retained earnings as of 1 January 2023. 
b) Global minimum top-up tax
The Group has adopted International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules 
(Amendments to IAS 12) upon their release on 23 May 2023. The amendments

about the Pillar Two exposure. However, because no new legislation to 
implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted at 31 December 
2022 in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and no related deferred tax 
was recognized at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements.
6. Operating segments
The chief operating decision makers of the Group examine performance from a 
regional perspective and have identified three reportable segments of its global 
trading business: Europe, the Americas and Asia.
Europe consists of activities in the Netherlands with institutional trading 
activities in France, UK, Italy, trading activities in Jersey and IT activities in 
Romania. Americas consists of the subsidiaries in the USA. Asia contains our 
subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore and a Chinese representative office in 
Shanghai. The executive directors of the Board consider this segmentation to be 
relevant to understand the Group financial performance because it allows 
investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate 
the operating performance and decision making about allocation of resources 
and trading capital.
The Group measures results on an IFRS basis and reconciles the total segment 
results on net trading income, profit before tax and net profit. Significant 
transactions and balances between geographic regions occur primarily as result 
of Group operating companies incurring the operating expenses such as 
employee compensation, communication, software development and data 
processing and overhead costs for the purpose of providing services to affiliated 
operating companies (line items intercompany recharge income and expenses).
The Group’s trading assets and liabilities attributable to each segment are 
reported to management on the basis of net trading capital. Consequently, the 
reported total assets in each segment are net of the segment’s financial 
liabilities held for trading, trading payables and other liabilities held for trading.

7. Fair value measurement
Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes 
based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about 
the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes 
specific to that asset or liability.
Valuation models 
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement 
that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer 
the liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants 
at the measurement date. 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, 
depending on the inputs used for making the measurements.
▪
Level 1: fair value of financial instruments based upon inputs that are quoted, 
unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical instruments;
▪
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from 
prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market 
prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or 
similar instruments in markets that are not considered active; or other 
valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly 
observable from market data;
▪
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments 
for which the valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a 
significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes 
instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments 
but for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are 
required to reflect differences between the instruments, for example 
unlisted equity securities.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active 
markets are based on prices obtained directly from an exchange on which the 
instruments are traded or obtained from a broker that provides an unadjusted 
quoted price from an active market for identical instruments. For all other 
financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation 
techniques.

When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities 
on the basis of net exposures to market risks, it applies judgement in 
determining appropriate portfolio-level adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. 
Such adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask spreads for similar 
instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. 
Similarly, when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial 
liabilities on the basis of net exposure to the credit risk of a particular 
counterparty, it takes into account any existing arrangements that mitigate the 
credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty).

Implied Volatility (80%-120%)
If implied volatility were to increase, 
the fair value would increase
A reasonably possible alternative assumption to the management performance 
adjustment is an increase or decrease of the percentage by 25 percent. For 
investments measured at FVTPL, this would not have a material effect. For 
investments measured at FVOCI, this would increase/decrease the fair value by 
a total of €227k. A reasonably possible alternative assumption to the illiquidity 
discount is an increase or decrease of the percentage by 5 percent. For 
investments measured at FVTPL, this would increase/decrease the total fair 
value by €837k. For investments measured at FVOCI, this would increase/
decrease the total fair value by a €125k.
A reasonably possible alternative assumption for applying the range of implied 
volatility would be to apply a 120 percent implied volatility for all other liabilities 
held for trading measured using a significant unobservable input of implied 
volatility. This would result in a decrease in total fair value other liabilities held 
for trading by €190k. If those instruments were to all have an 80 percent implied 
volatility, the impact would be a decrease in total fair value of other liabilities 
held for trading of €1.1m. 
b. Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The valuation of trading positions, both long and short positions, is determined 
by reference to last traded prices from identical instruments from the 
exchanges at the reporting date. Such financial assets and liabilities are 
classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are 
carried at fair value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted 
market prices. The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused 
by the fact that the Group continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities 
based on all available information. This includes prices for identical and near-
identical positions, as well as the prices for securities underlying the Group’s 
positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on which the 
financial asset or liability is primarily traded closes. Consequently, such financial 
assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to 
determine fair value.
c. Investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income ('OCI')
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income is determined by reference to their quoted closing bid 
price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation 
technique and are classified as Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular 
availability of quoted closing bid prices.

d. Investments measured at fair value through profit and loss
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through profit and loss is 
determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, 
or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique and are classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular availability of quoted closing bid 
prices.
e. Other assets held for trading 
Other assets held for trading comprises the amount of digital assets that the 
Group holds as a broker-dealer. The Group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets and 
these are measured at fair value through profit and loss. As the Company uses 
its own fair value models based on quoted prices or observable inputs for the 
valuation of the digital assets, these assets are classified as Level 2.
f. Other liabilities held for trading
The Group borrows digital assets as part of its trading strategy. The borrowed 
digital assets are measured at fair value through profit or losses. As the 
Company uses its own fair value models based on quoted prices, observable 
inputs or unobservable inputs for the valuation of the borrowed digital assets, 
these liabilities are classified as Level 2 and Level 3.

assets and liabilities according to their fair value hierarchy.

8. Hedge of net investments in foreign operations 
Included in financial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2023 was a 
borrowing of USD 19.3 million (2022: USD 19.9 million) which has been 
designated as a hedge of the net investment in the United States and Singapore 
subsidiaries, which have their functional currency in USD. This borrowing is 
being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign exchange risk on 
this investment. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are 
transferred to other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on 
translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the 
foreign exchange risk on the USD borrowing. The Group has established a hedge 
ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to the 
hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the amount 
of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the amount of 
the borrowing. The hedging gain recognized in other comprehensive income 
before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for measuring effectiveness. 
There is no ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss.
The impact of the hedging instrument recorded in financial liabilities held for 
trading on the statement of financial position is as follows:

9. Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders and the number of ordinary shares outstanding. 
The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted 
average effect of changes in treasury shares during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the basic earnings per 
share for the effects of all dilutive share-based payments to employees.

Share-based payments
Shares of the Company are awarded to employees as part of their variable 
compensation. Variable remuneration shares are awarded on a gross basis and 
net settled, such that the Company settles income tax obligations in cash on 
behalf of the employees. Company loyalty and sign-on package shares are 
awarded on a net basis, which gives rise to income tax obligations settled in 
cash by the Company on the employee's behalf. The Group expects to pay 
€10.3m to settle the tax obligations on behalf of the employees in 2024 (2023: 
€10.7m).
In either case the Group is responsible for withholding wage taxes upon vesting 
in the Netherlands and in most other countries of operations. The estimated 
amount of wage taxes can be up to 50%, for which future cash outflows may be 
covered by the sale of treasury shares.
Following the update to the Group's corporate structure at 13 January 2023 the 
change in the issuer of the shares from Flow Traders N.V. to Flow Traders Ltd. 
including the name of the company, legal seat and ISIN constitutes a 
modification to share-based payments. The Group measured the fair value of 
the outstanding share options based on the closing share price at 13 January 
2023 and concluded that this change was a non-beneficial modification and 
continued to measure the fair value at original grant date. No incremental 
expenses related to the fair value of the share options was included in profit or 
loss.

a) Variable remuneration share plans - equity settled
Under the variable remuneration share plans, shares are granted to employees 
as part of their variable compensation. The shares vest in four equal installments 
during the first quarter of the subsequent year over a period of three or four 
years subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on the 
vesting date.
Employees are granted shares based on a fixed monetary value. As part of the 
2023 variable remuneration plan the Company awarded shares to employees 
based on a fixed monetary value of €3.2 million. The number of shares granted 
are estimated based on the monetary value divided by the fair value of the 
share price at grant date. The final number of shares granted are determined 
based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the first open period of 
the following year, resulting in an updated calculation of the shares awarded, as 
is shown in the tables below. These awards have a nil exercise price.

b) Company loyalty and sign-on package share plans - equity 
settled
Under the Company loyalty and sign-on package share plans, shares are granted 
as a part of variable compensation to certain employees. The shares vest over a 
period of one to five years, depending on the share plan and agreement with 
the employee, subject to the condition that the employee remains employed on 
the vesting date. 
The fair value of the share options is estimated at the grant date. The fair value 
of shares granted to employees during 2023 is estimated at grant date at €1.1 
million (2022: €2.0 million), reflecting a weighted average fair value of shares 
granted of €22.9 (2022: €26.8). The exercise price of the share option is equal to 
the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The expense 
recognized during the year was €1.0 million (2022: €2.1 million).

c) Share appreciation rights - cash settled
Certain employees are awarded share appreciation rights (SARs) as part of their 
variable remuneration, settled in cash. The SARs vest in equal installments over 
a period of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The liability for the SARs is measured, initially 
and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the 
SARs. The carrying amount of the liability relating to the SARs at 31 December 
2023 was €8.6 million (2022: €10.4 million). The expense recognized during the 
year was €1.7 million (2022: €3.6 million). At year end there are no vested SARs 
that are unpaid.

difference is mainly caused by applying the participation exemption and Dutch 
innovation box regime. In addition the effective tax rate is impacted by non-
deductible share plan costs that occur in each region.

The Group recognized an impairment of €4.3 million in its investment in an 
associate, LedgerEdge Inc. As of 31 December 2023, the estimated recoverable 
amount of LedgerEdge Inc. is nil and there is no expectation of reversal in future

b) Joint Venture
The Group has invested in a joint venture in which the Group has joint control 
and 17.43% ownership interest through voting preferred shares. The Group, 
along with the other investors identified in the Shareholder Agreement as Major 
Investors, must each approve (unanimous consent) of matters in regard to the 
relevant activities of the joint venture. This results in collective control of the 
arrangement.
The Group does not consider the assessment of control a significant judgement 
under IAS 1 given the nature of those contractual terms and the activities which 
require agreement from each major investor. As per the shareholders' 
agreement, the Group is considered a major investor. 
The investee is developing a trading technology platform in the Asian Pacific 
region. In accordance with acquisition agreement, the Group may make an 
additional investment dependent on future events.
The following table summarizes the joint venture's financial statements for the 
period ending 30 November 2023. The Group uses the 30 November 2023

Payables for securities bought
In accordance with the Group’s policy of trade date accounting for regular sale 
and purchase transactions, payables for securities bought represent amounts 
payables for securities that were purchased, but not yet settled as at the 
reporting date. The amount payable is based on the net unsettled amount per 
clearing institution.
Credit Facilities
The Group maintains portfolio financing facilities with its prime brokers to 
facilitate the trading activities (i.e. to finance the purchase and settlement of 
financial instruments). The drawn amounts on these facilities continuously 
fluctuate based on our trading positions at any given moment.
The Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities with ABN AMRO 
Clearing Bank N.V. (AACB), totaling €2,825 million per year end, comprising of a 
EUR denominated facility of €2,350 million and a USD denominated facility of 
$540 million. In addition, the Group entered into interest-bearing credit facilities 
for portfolio margin financing with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BA ML), 
Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank. These facilities can be 
modified or terminated at any time. The facilities are exclusively for the 
financing of positions of the financial instruments traded in the ordinary course 
of the trading activities using the various prime brokers.
Our prime brokers require the Group to post cash to cover the haircut or margin 
requirements (representing a minor portion of our portfolio’s size, which is 
variable and calculated on a daily basis depending on portfolio size and 
composition) in cash or securities as security for our positions held with the 
relevant prime broker. The positions are subject to pledge and collateral 
arrangements.
Covenants
Pursuant to the main covenants included in our facilities, the Group is required 
to comply with a net liquidation balance that exceeds the haircut calculated by 
the prime broker. Both the net liquidation balance and haircut are variable and 
calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio size and composition. The 
main covenants prescribe certain maximum portfolio-to loan size (variable and 
calculated on a daily basis, depending on portfolio composition). In addition, for 
our Asian operations they require us to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 4%, 
calculated by shareholders' equity divided by credit limit.
The main covenants also require the Group to supply our prime brokers with 
financial statements and other information, including information on our trading 
activities and trading counterparties. Furthermore, they require us to maintain 
all relevant authorizations and memberships required in order to conduct our 
business, and comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and place 
restrictions on mergers and disposition of our assets outside the ordinary course 
of our business.
The Group has not had any defaults or other breaches with regard to any 
liabilities during 2023 or 2022.

Ordinary shares
Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to dividends and are 
entitled to one vote per share at general meetings of the Company.
On 2 December 2022 the Company increased the issued and paid up share 
capital from €4,653,450 to €162.870.750 with 46,534,500 shares with a nominal 
value of €3.50 each instead of €0.10 each. The share capital increase was carried 
out against the Company share premium account. During the year the 
authorized capital of the Company was increased from €10 million to €350 
million consisting of 100 million common shares of which 46,534,500 shares are 
issued.
Treasury shares 
As at 31 December 2023 Flow Traders Ltd and its subsidiaries held 3,422,732 
(2022: 3,699,872) of ordinary shares (treasury shares). Treasury shares held by 
the Group are not cancelled and are recognized at cost and deducted from 
Equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the P&L on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any differences between 
the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognized in equity. 
The purchases of treasury shares on the market are intended for hedging of our 
employee share plan obligations or for capital management purposes.
Share-based payment reserve 
The share based payment reserve is used to recognize the grant date fair value 
of shares granted to employees including the value of reinvested dividends on 
unvested shares. At the delivery of the shares to the employees the shares will 
be reclassified reducing the Share Based Payment Reserve and increasing the 
Share Premium Account. Please also refer to note 12 -  Employee Expenses.
Currency translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from 
the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. This also 
includes the hedge results.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve comprises the fair value movements on all Investments 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income of the Group.
General distributions
Pursuant to Article 24.1 of the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board, with 
the approval of the Non-Executive Directors, has decided that of the profit for 
2023 (totaling €36.2 million), an amount of € 19.5 million shall be added to the 
reserves. The remaining amount of € 16.7 million is at the disposal of the General 
Meeting of Shareholders (General Meeting).
Dividends
The Board declared a total cash dividend of €0.45 per share and this will be paid 
out to shareholders for the financial year 2023, subject to a 15% dividend 
withholding tax. An interim cash dividend of €0.30 per share was paid out in 
August 2023. This means that the final cash dividend proposal for a non-binding 
advisory vote to the General Meeting on 13 June 2024 is €0.15 per share.
31. Provisions and contingencies
The Group operates in various legal, administrative, tax and regulatory 
jurisdiction. From time to time, the Group is involved in proceedings concerning 
matters arising within the normal course of business. The outcomes of these 
proceedings are difficult to assess and may involve significant judgement and 
estimation uncertainty. 
Provisions
The Group have estimated and recognized provisions for a total of €4.1 million 
as of 31 December 2023 (2022: nil) related to regulatory claims. This amount is 
presented in Provisions on the Statement of Financial Position. The amount 
raised relates to alleged violations of trading regulations, the outcome of which 
is uncertain. The Group estimated the provision using assumptions based on 
observable historical settlements from similar regulators and for similar alleged 
violations in combination with internal recalculations of relevant trading 
activities. The provisions are recognized within Other Expenses in the Statement 
of Profit or Loss for the year ended 31 December 2023. The carrying value of the 
provision is most sensitive to the assumption based on historical cases. A 
reasonably possible 20% change in that assumption would result in a €360k 
increase or decrease in the provisions' carrying value.

The Group's judgement is that the settlement of these amounts will be within 12 
months of 31 December 2023. The amount of provisions for the year ending 31 
December 2022 was nil. 
Cash incentive provided to employees
Up until and including 2019, eligible employees could participate in an employee 
incentive plan and were eligible for a cash incentive depending on their share 
position in the Company. One of the conditions for this cash incentive is that the 
employee needs to be employed at the Company at time of the payment of the 
cash incentive. Payments will be made in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth 
year of the plan. Based on IAS 19, costs related to the cash incentive may not be 
recognized until the employee fulfills the service obligation. Therefore these 
costs will be recognized in future years in profit and loss. In 2023 the Company 
recognized €0.4 million of costs relating to this plan (2022: €1.8 million). 
As from 2020 certain employees receive part of their variable compensation in 
share appreciation rights (SARs). The SARs vest in equal installments over a 
period of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The SARS are expenses and recognized in the 
financial statements in line with the IFRS 2 Share based payment - cash settled 
accounting rules (refer also to note 12 - Employee Expenses).

Guarantees
Flow Traders B.V., Flow Traders US Holding LLC, Flow Traders US LLC and Flow 
Traders US Institutional Trading LLC (collectively “Guarantors”) have provided 
several guarantees for the obligations of Flow Traders US Institutional Trading 
LLC, Flow Traders US Holding LLC and Flow Traders US LLC (collectively 
“Beneficiaries) to external counterparties in relation to trading relationships. 
Obligation under the guarantees require Guarantors to fulfil claims of the 
Beneficiaries once it has not fulfilled one of its obligations directly related to the 
trading relationships. These guarantees are in effect for periods ranging from 1 
year to an indefinitive term as of the signing date of the agreement, which can 
be withdrawn with 1 week notice.
Contingent Liabilities
The Group’s calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the 
application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across EMEA, Asia 
and the Americas. In this context, it is possible that tax exposures which have 
not yet materialized may result in different interpretation of local rules. As of 31 
December 2023, management concluded that it is probable that the tax 
authority in the Netherlands will accept our treatment of interest limitation rules 
(article 15b paragraph 6(c)). It is possible that different interpretation of local 
rules may result in tax exposures from timing differences.
Contingent Assets
Flow Traders Investment Limited (FTIL) held both digital assets and fiat currency 
on FTX Trading Ltd.’s (FTX) digital asset exchange prior to FTX filing bankruptcy 
in November 2022. As a result of that bankruptcy, FTIL derecognised their 
balances held on FTX’s platform during the year ended 31 December 2022. FTIL 
subsequently filed a customer claim with the bankruptcy estate in September 
2023. As a result of the filing, FTIL is an FTX Debtor under the bankruptcy 
proceedings.

In October 2023, FTX announced a proposed settlement plan which included a 
Preference Settlement Amount. The Preference Settlement Amount, if 
approved, would allow FTX Debtors the opportunity to resolve any liabilities and 
claims with FTX on a net basis. As of 31 December 2023, the Group has 
concluded that an inflow of economic benefit from the Preference Settlement 
Amount is probable, but not virtually certain (hence, no asset has been 
recognized as of 31 December 2023). Additionally, the financial effect is 
impractical to estimate as there are unknown resolutions to specifics of the 
Preference Settlement Amount. In addition to the Preference Settlement 
Amount, the Group is also exploring options for a sale of its claim.

Flow Traders Foundation
As one of Flow Traders’ Non-Executive Board members sits on the Board of the 
Flow Traders Foundation (“Foundation”), the Foundation is considered a related 
party. 
In 2020 Flow Traders established the Flow Traders Foundation, a Charity or 
Foundation (“Stichting”) to better structure its historic engagement in giving to 
others in society who need (financial) help. During 2020 Flow Traders 
established the funding to make sure that a significant financial basis has been 
laid so that the Foundation has the financial means to make not only an annual 
but also a structural impact and meets its purpose.
In 2023 Flow Traders contributed a total value of €0.5 million (2022: €0.6 
million) related to the Multiyear right to appoint charities the Foundation 
supports as the main shirt sponsor of a Dutch professional football club. The 
Company also reserved an amount from the 2023 variable remuneration pool for 
employees for donation to the Foundation of €0.2 million in 2023 (2022: €0.4 
million). 
In addition, as part of donation agreements between certain Non-Executive 
Directors to the Board and the Foundation, the Foundation is obligated to invest 
the donations received from this member into shares of the Company. In 2023 
the Foundation received a donation of €0.5 million from current and former 
Non-Executive Board members, which it used to purchase 21,151 shares in Flow 
Traders Ltd. against a share price of €23.64.

Financial risk management
Overview
The Group is exposed to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
▪
Operational risk;
▪
Credit risk;
▪
Market risk;
▪
Foreign exchange risk;
▪
Interest Rate risk;
▪
Liquidity risk;
▪
Concentration risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and 
managing risk, and the Group’s management of our liquidity and capital.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Our Group Operational Risk framework contributes to raise awareness of these 
risks to all our employees and promotes a risk mitigation culture in all our 
processes. This includes documenting of procedures and periodically updating 
of this documentation. 
The risk governance and independence of the Risk team ensures that our risk 
appetite is appropriately implemented, monitored and reported to 
management on a regular basis. We maintain an internal operational risk event 
database that captures any incident that may have occurred (irrespective if it 
led to a financial loss/profit or not). We routinely perform an in-depth analysis 
of these incidents in order to avoid a reoccurrence. 
Every year, we conduct Risk Control Self Assessments (RCSA) across the 
organization to update what our main inherent risks are and which could be the 
most impactful in order to manage them to be within our risk appetite. 
Any breach of risk appetite is escalated to management. A decision is then 
made as to whether we should mitigate, defer or accept the breach. If 
mitigation is considered to be the appropriate action, a Taskforce is put in place 
to bring back the residual risk scoring within our risk appetite. This ongoing 
vigilance ensures we dedicate the appropriate amount of time and resources to 
improve our control environment in a consistent and risk-based manner.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the 
settlement of off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is 
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. These amounts significantly exceed expected 
loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes into account 
the likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of 
counterparty default is deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the 
counterparties and the central counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk at the reporting date was as follows:
Carrying amount
At 31 December
2023
2022
Cash and cash equivalents
5,708
8,612
Trading receivables
8,101,419
6,022,354
Other receivables
20,675
24,708
Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are 
guaranteed by the central counterparty or clearing house related to that 
exchange. Members of these clearing houses are required to deposit substantial 
amounts of cash, bonds or equities as collateral for any failure to settlement of 
trading. While still a limited part of our business, there is an inherent risk related 
to transactions on digital asset exchanges and protocols, both centralized and 
decentralized. Additionally, this risk is mitigated by strict onboarding 
procedures and limiting the value traded on exchange to minimize the 
maximum risk.

The Group manages credit risk through its Risk department that provide specific 
guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit 
risk.
Policies include amongst others;
▪
limits for individual product types
▪
limits per counterparty
▪
limits on the duration of the exposure
▪
limits for settlement types
▪
strict monitoring procedures for late settlements
▪
limits to exchanges
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty 
exposures are monitored on an intraday basis.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial 
liabilities that:
▪
are offset in the Group’s statement of financial position; or
▪
are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar 
agreement that covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether 
they are offset in the statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master 
repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. 
Similar financial instruments include derivatives, sales and repurchase 
agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and 
securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, such as loans and 
deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for 
offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because they create a 
right to offset recognized amounts for the parties to the agreement that is 
enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the 
Group or the counterparties or following other predetermined events.
In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net 
basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can 
receive and grant collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in 
respect of the following transactions:
▪
derivatives;
▪
sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
▪
securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable 
securities as set out in notes 17 and 26 in respect of derivatives (including 
swaps). Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms including, where 
appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities received/
granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction, 
but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each 
party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s 
failure to post collateral.
Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to 
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include: 
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and 
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar 
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to offset liabilities against 
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event 
of the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or 
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount 
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit 
exposure. However, the offsetting criteria in IFRS 9 are not met in all cases.

Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial 
instrument fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited 
to, interest rates, volatilities, currency rates, future dividend expectations and 
equity prices. The Risk department monitors market risk exposure on a 
continuous intraday basis. Based on the limits set per product or the aggregated 
risk for the Group, limit breaches will trigger action from the Risk department in 
order to reduce the risk back to within our preset limits.
In addition to the Group’s Risk department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily by Operations. The applicable haircut and margins are 
computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The Risk department computes the 
haircut using internal models enabling intraday monitoring. Limits are set on 
both capital- and credit usage. Long and short trading positions include 
securities and derivatives such as: shares, American Depository Receipts (ADR’s) 
s), options, warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRA’s), exchange-traded 
products (ETP) and digital assets. All traded financial instruments are liquid 
instruments. Therefore, our portfolio can always be liquidated within a short 
time frame and with a limited cost impact.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize its risk for adverse 
price movements and does not engage in long or short only positions. The 
direction of market movements, i.e. what the Group considers directional 
market risk taking, is not relevant for the Group because of our market-making 
trading strategy. Due to the manner in which the Group hedges foreign 
currency, interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is 
close to zero. Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency 
risk and settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are 
captured in the risk and margin requirements which the Group is required to 
post at its prime brokers and clearing firms. The consolidated margin and 
haircut requirements over 2023 are shown in the Capital management 
paragraph. Although the positions are fully hedged, a minimum risk close to 
zero remains as a result of inefficiencies in the models of the prime brokers.
Market risk factors relating to digital assets and liabilities
In a similar matter to traditional assets, the price of a digital asset or liability 
fluctuates according to its supply and demand. We manage this risk by holding 
digital assets in the same proportion as liabilities (long/short delta neutral 
book). Per year end we had a total exposure to digital assets of € 0.2 million 
(2022: € 0.4 million).
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions 
denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of 
the Group entities, primarily the Euro, as well as United States dollars and 
Singapore dollars.
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as 
well as net results of these foreign operations during the year. The Group 
manages foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by 
currency. Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in 
currencies other than the functional currency. The Group does use financial 
instruments to hedge the translation risk related to net investments in foreign 
operations or net results of foreign operations. Due to the manner in which the 
Group hedges foreign currency risk, the directional foreign currency risk is close 
to zero. Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial 
instruments. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches 
of arranged interest rates of assets and liabilities. The Group has limits in place 
on interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These limits ensure that interest 
rate risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging 
strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. 
All financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at 
fair value on the statement of financial position. Positions carried on the 
statement of financial position are short term and listed on exchanges and 
therefore liquid and tradable.
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility 
available to facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the statement of 
financial position. In order to match the liquidity and short holding period of 
these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate payable, which is 
floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact 
that the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/
short positions and in the ETP of the future. Due to the manner in which the 
Group hedges interest rate risk, the directional interest rate risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.

Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well 
as the Group’s investments in investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income or through profit and loss. In addition, for its option 
positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk 
factor. Other factors to consider are time and dividend expectations.
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual 
positions per product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the 
size of the exposure, concentrations, pricing and valuation parameters and 
natural hedging between these long and short positions. As the Group is active 
in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in underlying 
values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and 
margins are computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis 
measures all positions, individual and correlated, and reflects the different risk 
components. The third-party haircut calculation confirms the internal 
assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is exposed 
to on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is 
presented under the earlier "Market risk" section.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the 
obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering 
cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to 
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without 
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The 
Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime 
brokers, is monitored on a daily basis.

Concentration risk
Concentration risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in 
similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have 
similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual 
obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other 
conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s 
performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic 
location. The Group’s policies and procedures and the broad geographic and 
industry spread of its activities limit its exposure to any concentration risk. 
Additionally management has established credit limits for geographic and 
counterparty exposures, which are monitored on a daily basis. We monitor the 
distribution of assets and off-balance sheet items by geographic region and 
industry sector on an ongoing basis.

Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the 
prime brokers through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well 
as cash generated from our operating activities. As of 31 December 2023, the 
Group held €5.7 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to €8.6 million 
as of 31 December 2022. These balances are maintained primarily to support 
operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient short-term 
access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.
The Group maintains a highly liquid statement of financial position, with a large 
portion of its total assets consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable securities 
and short-term trading receivables (arising from securities transactions).
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intraday basis and maintains 
significant portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to 
facilitate trading. These facilities are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as 
well as all financial assets in accounts held at the respective prime brokers. The 
Group has no outstanding borrowings other than the portfolio financing 
facilities with prime brokers.
Capital management
Regulatory capital requirements
As a result of the corporate restructuring per 13 January 2023 the Group is not 
subject to consolidated capital requirements under the EU Directive Investment 
Firm Regulation (IFR) and Investment Firm Directive (IFD). Regulated Flow 
Traders subsidiaries do comply with the local capital requirement regulations as 
monitored by their respective National Competency Authority (NCA). 
The Board monitors the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to 
shareholders while complying with prime broker and regulatory capital 
requirements. The available capital in the trading companies is monitored on a 
daily basis to ensure that requirements are met at all times and sufficient capital 
is available to support the Group’s strategy. Trading capital as at 31 December 
2023 was €583.7 million (31 December 2022 €651.0 million).

Notes to the parent company financial statements
All amounts in thousands of euro, unless stated otherwise.
Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the 
determination of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and 
liabilities and determination of the result for its parent Company financial 
statements, the Group applies the option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the 
Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the recognition and measurement of 
assets and liabilities and determination of the result (hereinafter referred to as 
principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent Company financial 
statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS -EU financial 
statements. Participating interests over which the Company has significant 
influence, are measured at equity value. Please see notes to consolidated 
statements chapter 1 to 4 for a description of the Group’s IFRS -EU principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Company’s share in the 
results of these participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the 
transfer of assets and liabilities between (i) the Group and its participating 
interests on (ii) between participating interests themselves, are not recognized.
Restatement of prior period error
Intercompany Cost-Sharing Arrangement
During 2023, the Company identified that management-related expenses 
incurred by the Company which should have been recharged to subsidiaries 
through a cost-sharing arrangement (“Arrangement”). The Arrangement allows 
for the recharge of expenses to Flow Traders Holdings LLC and Flow Traders B.V.. 
The Arrangement allocates a percentage of expenses to each subsidiary (“Cost 
Base”) as well as an additional mark-up (“Mark-up”). The Company concluded that 
the financial effects of the Arrangement only became material from the year 
ended 31 December 2018 onwards. The Company also identified that it had not 
recognized expenses to which it pays a recharge to Flow Traders B.V. (“Upstream 
expense”). The Upstream Revenue is a result of certain employees in Flow Traders 
B.V. providing services to Flow Traders Ltd. (e.g. investor relations). 
There was nil impact to the opening total equity before result appropriation as of 
1 January 2022. This is a result of the following factors: 
▪
The effect on profit after tax was nil for the period as the increase in 
intergroup revenue by an amount of €37.7m was equally offset by a 
combination of the decrease in share of results from equity-accounted 
investments by an amount of €31.3m,  the increase in expenses due to the 
Upstream expense of €0.9m and an increase in tax expense by an €5.5m.
▪
There was no impact to the Balance Sheet due to the offsetting of the 
increase in investment in subsidiary by €31.2m, due to the Company receiving 
payment in-kind for the Arrangement, by the decrease from the impact of its 
share in the results of the subsidiary. Additionally, the Company was in the 
same fiscal unity group of the impacted subsidiary resulting in a nil impact to 
tax liabilities. 
There was nil impact to the closing total equity before result appropriation as of 
31 December 2022. This is a result of the following factors:
▪
The effect on profit after tax was nil for the period as the increase in 
intergroup revenue by an amount of €13.4m was equally offset by a 
combination of the decrease in share of results from equity-accounted 
investments by an amount of €10.9m, the increase in expenses due to the 
Upstream expense of €0.3m and the increase in tax expense by an €2.2m.
▪
There was no impact to the Balance Sheet due to the offsetting of the 
increase in investment in subsidiary by €10.9m, due to the Company receiving 
payment in-kind for the Arrangement, by the decrease from the impact of its 
share in the results of the subsidiary. Additionally, the Company was in the 
same fiscal unity group of the impacted subsidiary resulting in a nil impact to 
tax liabilities.

Finally, given the restated intergroup expenses, there was a change in 
presentation of the intergroup revenue and intergroup expenses in the Income 
Statement. The change in presentation is to present the gross revenues and gross 
expenses where they had previously been stated net. There was nil impact to 
Intergroup Result and Profit for the year as a result of this change in presentation 
for any of the periods presented.
Reclassification of current liabilities to non-current liabilities
Long-term bonus payables of €8.86m had previously been incorrectly presented 
as current liabilities in the 31 December 2022 financial statements. These liabilities 
have been reclassified in the comparative figures to be presented Other non-
current liabilities within total non-current liabilities. The reclassification has nil 
impact on the profit and loss or changes in equity. The relevant notes (Note 5 and 
Note 6) have also been restated to incorporate the reclassification.  
Reclassification of retained earnings into other legal reserves
As of 31 December 2023, it was determined that a portion of retained earnings 
should be reclassified into an other legal reserves as required by the Dutch Civil 
Code (see note 16). As a result, retained earnings as of 1 January 2022 and 31 
December 2022 have been restated to reclassify €164.1m of retained earnings into 
the other legal reserve. Of the €164.1m, €117.4m was reclassified as of 1 January 
2022 and €46.7m was reclassified during the year ending 31 December 2022. The 
reclassification is reflected in the Company’s balance sheet and Note 7. There was 
nil impact to net profit/(loss). There was nil impact to net assets.

8. Intergroup revenues
The Company generates revenues providing management services to its 
subsidiaries (customers). There were no other sources of revenue from contracts 
with customers. 
The Company’s performance obligation is to provide management services 
throughout the course of the year. The consideration for these services is 
recognized on a cost-plus margin arrangement, where the cost base is 
determined based on the costs incurred to provide the services. Revenue is 
recognized as and when the control of the services is transferred to the 
customers.

Cash incentive provided to employees
As from 2020 certain employees receive part of their variable compensation in 
share appreciation rights (SARs). The SARs vest in equal installments over a 
period of four to five years subject to the condition that the employee remains 
employed on the vesting date. The SARS are expenses and recognized in the 
financial statements in line with the IFRS 2 Share based payment - cash settled 
accounting rules (refer also to note 9 - Employee Expenses).

Double materiality 
In 2023 we refreshed the materiality assessment 
which was conducted in late 2020. A double 
materiality assessment was conducted as a critical 
input for the ESG sustainability strategy to be 
implemented in the course of 2024. Based on the 
guidance from the European Sustainability 
Reporting standards (ESRS), the double materiality 
assessment (DMA) reflects the impact materiality 
and the financial materiality.
Double Materiality Process
The DMA was conducted by a cross-business 
project team, assessing - by means of group 
dialogue - 120 ESG topics from nearly 90 sub-sub 
topics stipulated by the ESRS 1 standard, enriched 
with around 30 additional topics from examples of 
IROs provided in the ESRS topical standards. Flow 
Traders’ double materiality process consists of 
eight steps as outlined below:
1. Understanding context
Stakeholders that are or could be affected by Flow 
Traders, and stakeholders that affect or could 
affect Flow Traders are central to the materiality 
assessment process. We have the following five 
stakeholder groupings: political & regulatory, 
suppliers, own organization, institutional 
counterparties, financial & social interest. To 
understand their concerns and how their interests 
may be impacted, we continuously engage with 
these stakeholders to support identification of 
impacts, risks, and opportunities that should be 
considered in the materiality assessment. We 
collect insights for improvement actions and 
receive feedback on strategy, performance and 
progress.
2. Determining potentially relevant 
sustainability matters topics
We monitor the sustainability context of our 
activities and business relationships by reviewing 
relevant sources of information about our industry 
and peers, international standards and (upcoming) 
legislation, media and ESG rating agencies. Based 
on these analyses, insights from stakeholder 
engagement and internal impact and risk 
assessments, an initial list of potential material 
sustainability matters per value chain actor is 
drafted.
3. Identifying impacts, risks and 
opportunities
We use the insights gained from stakeholder 
engagements during the year and other relevant 
sources to identify sustainability matters and 
impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) that are 
relevant to us. Impacts include positive and 
negative, actual and potential, and short- and 
long-term impacts from our operations and across 
our value chain. Risks and opportunities relate to 
our ability to continue to use or obtain the 
resources needed in our business processes and 
our ability to rely on relationships needed in 
business processes on acceptable terms. Risks and 
opportunities may pertain to financial capital, 
intellectual capital, human capital, social and 
relationship capital, and natural capital. When 
identifying material IROs, all relevant direct and 
indirect value chain actors were considered. 
However, in accordance with the ESRS IRO 
guidance, the relationships that are likely to be 
associated with material IROs are those which we 
have leverage or may be able to exert influence. 
4. Assessing the impact materiality
To identify the sustainability matters that are most 
relevant to us and our stakeholders, the materiality 
assessment is conducted on the most granular 
level, so-called sub-sub topics. We assess the 
materiality of positive and negative impacts 
resulting from our business activities, based on the 
scale, scope, and irremediable character (the 
severity) including the likelihood that the event will 
occur, and the level of stakeholder concern. For 
potential negative human-rights related impacts, 
severity takes precedence over likelihood.
5. Assessing the financial materiality 
To identify the sustainability matters that are most 
relevant to us related to (potential) future financial 
effects, we applied the sub-sub topics identical as 
in step 4. We assess the anticipated financial effect 
of each risk and opportunity based on magnitude 
and likelihood. The magnitude of the financial 
effect considers effects on the ability to continue 
to use resources, including access, availability and 
prices. It also includes our ability to continue to 
rely on relationships, and taking into account 
reputational effects and potential actions by 
stakeholders in the short, medium and long term. 
Likelihood reflects the probability that a risk or 
opportunity event will occur.
6. Deciding on thresholds for materiality
The assessment results in a materiality score for 
each impact, risk and opportunity, and we use 
these impact scores to apply thresholds for 
materiality. Thresholds are determined separately 
for negative impacts, positive impacts, risks and 
opportunities. For creating an overview of material 
sustainability matters, impacts, risks and 
opportunities are clustered into material 
sustainability matters. Sustainability matters may 
be material from the impact perspective, the 
financial perspective or both.

7. Strategic implications
The outcomes of the materiality assessment serve 
as input for the ESG sustainability strategy. 
Material ESG sustainability matters are linked to 
themes in the ESG sustainability strategy, and the 
relevant value drivers for each of those strategic 
themes. If new material ESG sustainability matters 
are identified, they are added to the ESG 
sustainability strategy. If new ESG sustainability 
risks are identified, they are included in our risk 
inventory and managed in line with our Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework. We define 
measures to manage the related impacts, risks and 
opportunities for each material ESG sustainability 
topic, including metrics, targets, policies and 
action plans.
8. Results of the 2023 Double Materiality 
Assessment
Initial results of the Double Materiality Assessment, 
conducted by a cross-business project team, 
ascertained 17 material ESG topics. We have 
engaged with our stakeholders in the value chain 
to obtain their input. Two amendments were made 
after the results from stakeholder validation. 
The double materiality matrix including the impact 
areas and strategic themes were approved and 
signed-off by the Board. The double materiality 
matrix, as shown on the right, can be seen with the 
material ESG topics contained in the upper two 
boxes. No topics were identified which is deemed 
material from solely a financial material 
perspective.

Our impact areas
We want to grow our business and increase our positive impact while minimizing our negative impacts on the environment and people. When identifying the materiality of each ESG 
topic we looked at the area in our value chain where positive or negative impacts, or both are likely to occur and those actors which we have leverage or may be able to exert 
influence. By doing this, we keep our focus on the ESG topics where we can have the greatest impact.

About the non-
financial indicators
Reporting scope
The sustainability ESG related data indicators and 
value creation model disclosed in this 2023 Annual 
Report is based on the material topics identified 
through the 2020 materiality assessment.
In 2023, a double materiality assessment was 
conducted as a critical input for the ESG 
sustainability strategy to be implemented in the 
course of 2024. As the DMA guidance from the 
ESRS were formalized late 2023, in this 2023 
Annual Report we report on the results of the DMA 
and the strategic pillars, after which in 2024 we will 
work on developing the strategy and deployment 
plans for each of the five pillars. 
The non-financial indicators generally covers Flow 
Traders worldwide performance from 1 January 
2023 to 31 December 2023. 
Reporting methodology
The non-financial data disclosed in this report is 
derived from various sources, and the way data is 
processed differs across our operating subsidiaries 
and departments. This causes a degree of 
uncertainty, because of limitations in measuring 
and estimating data. We continue to work on 
improving our ESG sustainability data control 
environment and data collection processes. 
Remarks on GHG emissions data indicators
The CO2e emissions reported are in line with the 
greenhouse gas (GHG) Protocol. For scope 1 and 
scope 2 emissions, Flow Traders applies the 
operational control approach for the consolidation of 
its CO2e emissions footprint. This means that Flow 
Traders accounts for all emissions from the 
operations over which it has control. 
The operations, i.e. office locations, as presented 
below have therewith been included in this CO2e 
emissions footprint calculation.

In addition to the office locations, the use of server 
space from data centers is particularly relevant to 
Flow Traders’ business activities. These have been 
included in the scope 3 CO2e emissions footprint 
calculation. Due to the confidentiality of the 
information, the locations of the data centers will 
not be disclosed. 
Data quality
The calculated CO2e footprint of GHG emissions 
emitted, through Flow Traders own business 
activities and those through its value chain, contains 
several factors of uncertainties, primarily due to 
limitations in the availability of actual emissions 
data.
The table on next the page provides an overview of 
the uncertainties and data limitations for each 
emission category included in the calculation. 
Facilitated emissions
Capital Markets sit at the nexus of financial flows 
that must increasingly be directed towards more 
sustainable practices if we are to avoid the worst 
effects of climate change. Furthermore, a capital 
market issuances that occurs in a particular year will 
impact the climate for many subsequent years. 
Actors within these markets have an opportunity to 
help those financial flows move into activities that 
minimize climate impact. The PCAF Facilitated 
Emissions Standard allows financial institutions to 
consistently measure and disclose emissions 
associated with capital market business activities.
The Facilitated Emissions Standard aims to increase 
transparency across this category of financial 
transactions. The standard covers the primary 
issuance of capital markets instruments and loan 
syndication. A primary issuance refers to new 
securities to provide debt-based or equity-based 
financing, including new issuance of various types of 
bonds issued for general purposes, common stock, 
equity and debt investments in private companies, 
preferred shares, and syndicated loans.
We have review the PCAF framework and concluded 
that facilitated emissions are not applicable to Flow 
Traders, whereas Flow Traders operated in the 
secondary markets and does not involve with 
primary issuance of capital or financial instruments.

EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system, which 
will be used to determine, and report on, which 
activities are sustainable, through the creation of 
activity specific sustainability criteria. As financial 
and non-financial actors must report on their 
performance in reference to the same criteria, the 
Taxonomy will create a common language for 
companies, investors and society alike. Corporate 
activities (known as economic activities under the 
Taxonomy regulation), will need to be aligned with 
the following three elements to be considered 
sustainable or “green” under the Taxonomy 
Regulation: a) Substantially contribute to at least 
one of the six environmental objectives per the 
Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) defined in the 
Regulation; b) Do no significant harm to any of the 
remaining five environmental objectives; and c) 
Comply with the minimum social safeguards. The 
European Commission (EC) is defining TSC for the six 
environmental objectives at a sector and economic 
activity level. The TSC for Climate Change 
Adaptation (CCA) and Climate Change Mitigation 
(CCM) have already been defined in the EU 
Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act.
The EU Taxonomy Regulation was adopted by the 
European Parliament in June 2020 and is now 
binding throughout the EU. Over the past two years, 
FY 2021 and FY 2022, Flow Traders has reported EU 
Taxonomy eligibility of the total assets (% GAR 
eligibility). With the change of the corporate legal 
structure, in which the top holding company moved 
from the Netherlands to Bermuda as of 13 January 
2023, the reporting landscape changed as follows:
▪
Flow Traders Ltd. (Bermuda) is the top holding
▪
Flow Traders Ltd. is legal successor of Flow 
Traders N.V. (Netherlands)
▪
substantial presence of Flow Traders B.V. 
(operating trading subsidiary) remains in the 
Netherlands
Consequently, Flow Traders Ltd is deemed non-
financial undertaking, reporting on % taxonomy 
aligned turnover, CapEx and OpEx. Given that Flow 
Traders Ltd. is listed on the regulated market in 
Euronext Amsterdam, it is in scope of the corporate 
reporting in accordance with the NFRD and 
Accounting Directive, therefore EU Taxonomy 
reporting is required.
However, Flow Traders B.V. does not fall within the 
scope of the Accounting Directive. Therefore the 
NFDR and EU Taxonomy requirements are not 
applicable to Flow Traders B.V.
Reporting approach for FY 2023
The EU Taxonomy reporting for FY 2023 can be 
considered as a bridging exercise, whereby for 2023 
only the activities of Flow Traders Ltd. are in scope. 
Unlike Flow Traders B.V., none of the activities of 
Flow Traders Ltd. meet the definition of 'Financial 
undertaking’ as mentioned in Article 1 of the 
Delegated Act Article 8 Regulation. Therefore, in 
2023 Flow Traders Ltd. should apply Annex II 
reporting for non-financial undertakings.
For the financial year 2023, Flow Traders Ltd. is 
required to report on the following EU Taxonomy 
KPIs: % Taxonomy-aligned turnover, % Taxonomy-
aligned CapEx and % Taxonomy-aligned OpEx
Reporting approach as of FY 2024
In 2024, when the NFRD transforms into the CSRD, 
the threshold criteria in the Accounting Directive will 
also change to align with the CSRD thresholds. From 
FY 2024 onwards Flow Traders B.V. will be 
considered as a financial undertaking and 
accordingly will be in scope for the EU Taxonomy . 
This means that Flow Traders Ltd., applying 
consolidated reporting, will report EU Taxonomy 
KPIs %GAR from 2024 onwards.
EU Taxonomy report 2023
The European Parliament and the Council have 
prioritized economic activities that can make the 
most relevant contribution. The Climate Delegated 
Act sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors 
that are most relevant for achieving climate 
neutrality. The Climate Delegated Act identified 
more than 80 activities in 13 sectors. Currently not all 
sectors and related economic activities are covered 
by the Taxonomy Regulation and its delegated acts.
The EU Taxonomy uses the European industry 
classification system (NACE) as orientation to 
indicate eligible economic activities. The NACE code 
for Flow Traders Ltd. is K64.2.0 - Activities of holding 
companies.
We report a nil value for the EU Taxonomy KPIs 
revenue, CapEx and OpEx alignment percentage for 
2023. As of 31 December 2023, the economic 
activities of Flow Traders Ltd. are not (yet) covered 
by the sectors in the EU Taxonomy. Therefore, the 
technical screening criteria for Taxonomy eligibility 
for Flow Traders are not determined and available, 
thus the percentage Taxonomy-aligned for financial 
activities cannot be assessed. Flow Traders Ltd. is 
therefore not able to determine Taxonomy aligned 
activities and calculate the Taxonomy reporting KPIs 
(% turnover, CapEx and OpEx) for 2023 reporting. 
Hence the tables on pages 163 - 163 cannot be 
completed.

Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
▪
The accompanying parent company financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the financial position of Flow Traders Ltd as at 31 December 2023 and

Code
The consolidated financial statements comprise:
▪
The consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023
▪
The following statements for 2023: the consolidated statement of profit or

▪
The parent company balance sheet as at 31 December 2023
▪
The parent company income statement for 2023
▪
The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other 
explanatory information
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch 
Standards on Auditing, and in accordance with the International Standards on 
Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report.
We are independent of Flow Traders Ltd in accordance with the Wet toezicht 
accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening 
inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to 
independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. 
Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels 
accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
The ViO and VGBA are at least as demanding as the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) of 
the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (the IESBA Code).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. 
Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following 
information in support of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this 
context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these 
matters.
Our understanding of the business

## Page 167

Flow Traders is a global financial technology-enabled multi-asset class liquidity 
provider with its core business in Exchange Traded Products, which includes fixed 
income, currencies, digital assets and commodities. Flow Traders is structured in 
components and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. In our audit, 
we paid specific attention to a number of areas driven by the nature of the group 
and our risk assessment.
We determined materiality and identified and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order 
to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Materiality
Materiality
€ 2.2 million (2022: €8.0 million)
Benchmark applied
5% of profit before tax (rounded)
Explanation
Based on our professional judgement and our perception 
of the financial information needs of the users of the 
financial statements, a benchmark of 5% of profit before 
tax is an appropriate quantitative indicator of materiality 
as profit before tax best reflects the financial 
performance of Flow Traders. We determined materiality 
consistently with the previous financial year, as a result 
our materiality reflects the decrease in profit before tax 
as compared to previous financial year.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements 
that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for 
qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the Audit Committee of the board (hereinafter: the Audit 
Committee) that misstatements in excess of € 0.1 million, which are identified 
during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this 
group is included in the consolidated financial statements.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for 
directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have 
determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for 
group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities 
or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or 
review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or 
specific items.
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities, Flow Traders Ltd 
(parent company), Flow Traders BV and Flow Traders U.S. LLC, and we issued 
group audit instructions to all component teams in scope. We have:
▪
Performed audit procedures ourselves at group entities Flow Traders Ltd and 
Flow Traders BV
▪
Used the work of another (non-EY) auditor when auditing the group entity 
Flow Traders U.S. LLC
▪
Used the work of other EY Global member firms and the same non-EY auditor 
to perform specific audit procedures at other group entities and account 
balances.
On a regular basis, we interacted with the component teams during the various 
stages of the audit. Based on our risk assessment, we visited the component 
team for Flow Traders U.S. LLC and we reviewed the local working papers and 
conclusions. Moreover we are also directly involved in parts of the audit 
procedures by auditing certain accounts centrally for Flow Trader U.S. LLC and 
communicate regularly with the component’s management. 
By performing the procedures mentioned above at components of the group, 
together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial information 
to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Teaming and use of specialists
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included 
the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed 
client in the business of providing liquidity to financial markets. We included 
specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, sustainability, share based payments, 
derivatives and investments valuation, tax and transfer pricing, and have made 
use of our own experts in the area of auditing digital assets and certain 
disclosures that include capital requirements.
Our focus on climate-related risks 
The board summarized Flow Traders’ ESG  (environmental, social and governance) 
focus areas and reported in the section ESG at a glance of the management 
report how the company is addressing climate-related and environmental risks 
also taking into account related regulatory and supervisory guidance and 
recommendations. 
As part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which 
climate-related risks are taken into account in estimates and significant 
assumptions. Furthermore, we read the management report and considered 
whether there is any material inconsistency between the non-financial 
information in the annual report and the financial statements.
Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks 
to have a material impact on the financial reporting judgements, estimates or 
significant assumptions as at 31 December 2023.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we 
cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is 
our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, 
taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial 
statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the 
company and its environment and the components of the system of internal 
control, including the risk assessment process and the board’s process for 
responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and 
how the Risk Committee exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer 
to Section Our risk management of the board report for the board’s (fraud) risk 
assessment.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control 
and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, the 
global whistleblower policy and incident registration. We evaluated the design 
and the implementation of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. As 
part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with 
respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and 
corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated 
whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is 
present.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered 
the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings 
were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.
We addressed the risks related to management override of controls, as this risk is 
present in all companies. For these risks we have performed procedures among 
other things to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may 
represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to 
important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in 
Note 7 to the financial statements. We have also used data analytics to identify 
and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or the 
lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions. We evaluated that there 
are risks of fraud in the gross trading income recognized on financial assets and 
liabilities held for trading, as management may override controls around fair value 
measurement. We describe the audit procedures responsive to this risk in our key 
audit matter “Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for 
trading”.
Furthermore, we identified a risk related to the private keys of digital asset 
wallets being misappropriated or compromised. We describe the audit 
procedures responsive to this risk in our key audit matter “Existence and 
valuation of digital assets”.

We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, 
directors, internal audit, legal, compliance, human resources, risk management 
and regional directors and the Audit Committee. 
The fraud risks we identified, enquiries and other available information did not 
lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially 
impacting the view of the financial statements.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations
Flow Traders is subject to many laws and regulations from market regulators and 
for its trading activities on exchanges worldwide where the consequences of 
non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the 
financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or instructions. 
We refer to section ‘Our risk management’ section of the management report for 
the areas identified by the board with a risk of non-compliance with regulations 
and Note 31 ‘Provisions and contingent liabilities’ to the financial statements.
We performed appropriate audit procedures regarding compliance with the 
provisions of those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the 
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with 
laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect 
on the financial statements from our general industry experience, through 
discussions with the board and the Audit Committee, reading minutes, inspection 
of internal audit and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of 
details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.
We inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities 
and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout 
the audit. Finally we obtained written representations that all known instances of 
non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.  
Our audit response related to going concern
As disclosed in Note 3 ‘Basis of preparation’ section b) ‘Going concern basis of 
accounting’ to the financial statements, the financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial statements, the 
board made a specific assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.
We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with the board, exercising 
professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism. We considered 
whether the board’s going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and 
understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or 
otherwise, contains all relevant events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties 
about going concern. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of 
most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have 
communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee. The key audit 
matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. 
The update in the corporate structure of Flow Traders on 13 January 2023 was a 
(one-time) key audit matter in our 2022 auditor’s report. Taking into account the 
company’s growing portfolio of (long-term) investments and the changed 
composition of this portfolio, a new key audit matter has been defined in relation 
to the valuation of (long-term) investments. Also, we have defined the reliability 
and continuity of the IT environment to be a key audit matter
.

Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Risk
At 31 December 2023 the Financial assets held for trading amount 
to € 5.5 billion (2022: € 4.9 billion) and the Financial liabilities held 
for trading amount to € 3.1 billion (2022: € 3.0 billion), as disclosed 
in Note 16 and Note 25 to the financial statements, respectively. 
Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of financial assets and 
liabilities held for trading is based on internally determined 
theoretical prices as disclosed in Note 7 to the financial 
statements. These prices can differ from closing prices at various 
stock exchanges or prices from clearers, due to market illiquidity, 
variety in opening hours of the stock exchanges and the prices 
used for identical or near-identical positions.
The fair values recorded require judgment which represents an 
increased risk of improper adjustments in fair valuation, directly 
impact the gross trading income. Therefore, we considered the 
valuation of financial assets and liabilities held for trading a key 
audit matter.
Our audit 
approach
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the 
appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies related to 
valuation of financial assets and liabilities according to IFRS 9 
“Financial Instruments” and IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”. In 
addition, we obtained an understanding of the valuation process, 
including verifications done by the company. We evaluated the 
design and implementation of internal controls relevant to fair 
value measurement.
We performed risk-based sample testing on the valuation of 
individual positions by evaluating the internally determined prices 
against market prices from independent sources. Furthermore, we 
evaluated the presentation and disclosure in the financial 
statements for compliance and consistency with IFRS 7 “Financial 
Instruments: Disclosure” and IFRS 13 on disclosure requirements 
for financial assets and liabilities held for trading, including the fair 
value hierarchy.
Key 
observation
s
Based on our procedures performed, we consider the fair value of 
the financial assets and liabilities held for trading to be reasonable 
as at 31 December 2023.
Existence and valuation of digital assets
Risk
At 31 December 2023, the cryptocurrencies portfolio (digital 
assets) amounts to € 169.8 million (2022: € 58.3 million) as 
disclosed in Note 18 Other assets held for trading. 
Digital assets are exchangeable directly between two parties 
through decentralized networks that record transaction and 
position data, which is publicly observable on the blockchain. 
These are digital assets kept in private wallets, which are each 
safeguarded by a private key. As these private keys grant access 
to the digital assets, the safeguarding of these keys are of high 
importance and there is an increased risk of misappropriation of 
these digital assets. Contradictory to digital assets kept in private 
wallets, direct trades on centralized exchanges and related 
positions in digital assets cannot be observed on the blockchain, 
as the digital assets on these centralized exchanges are stored in 
commingled wallets. Ownership has to be established based on 
legal terms. These exchanges are unregulated and due to the lack 
of transparency of transactions and positions there is an increased 
risk to existence and valuation of indicated positions. Reference is 
made to the information on digital assets in Note 34 Financial risk 
management. 
Due to the risks involved for both digital assets kept in private 
wallets and in commingled wallets, we considered the existence 
and valuation of digital assets held a key audit matter.

Our audit 
approach
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the 
appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies related to 
the classification and measurement of the digital assets under EU-
IFRSs.
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls related 
to digital assets, including reviews performed by the Risk and 
Operations and the Compliance departments in onboarding 
exchanges as well as trading in certain digital assets, involving our 
own experts in the area of digital assets. Furthermore, we 
evaluated the design and implementation of the daily trades 
reconciliation controls and procedures for deposits and 
withdrawals with cryptocurrency exchanges. We also evaluated 
the design and implementation of controls around the 
safeguarding of the private keys.
For assets in private wallets, we tested Flow Traders’ 
reconciliation of digital asset ending balances from its books to 
the blockchain and investigated any unusual and other reconciling 
items. We further verified that Flow Traders has access to its 
wallets, and therefore its digital assets, before and after the 
reporting date. For digital assets held on centralized exchanges, 
we observed the positions at the majority of the exchanges at 
year-end to verify the existence thereof.
We further tested the valuation of individual positions by 
comparing the internally determined prices to independent 
sources as at 31 December 2023.
Key 
observation
s 
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any 
material audit findings in relation to the existence and valuation of 
digital assets as at 31 December 2023.
Valuation of (long-term) investments accounted for at fair value 
Risk
Flow Traders invests in private companies across all geographies, 
with an emphasis on three key themes: platform, data, and 
connectivity. These investments include warrants, tokens and 
equity stakes in the companies of which most are in the start-up 
and scale-up phase. 
At 31 December 2023, the investments measured at fair value 
through OCI and Profit or Loss totaled to € 26.6 million (2022: € 
21.8 million), as disclosed in Note 20 and Note 21 to the financial 
statements, respectively. As described in Note 7 to the financial 
statements, management estimates the fair value of (long-term) 
investments accounted for at fair value, by applying reference to 
their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date or if unquoted, 
determined using a valuation technique using market observable 
and unobservable inputs and assumptions. Management 
judgment is required for these assumptions, which includes 
performance adjustments and discounts for liquidity.
Determining the fair value of investments using unobservable 
inputs and assumptions is a complex process and requires 
judgment from the board as these investments exhibit higher 
estimation uncertainty. Due to the matters described, we 
considered the valuation of investments accounted for at fair 
value a key audit matter.

Our audit 
approach
With involvement of our specialists, we obtained an 
understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of 
controls over the estimation of the valuation of the (long-term) 
investments and the appropriateness of the valuation 
methodologies applied, including the review of Flow Traders 
policies in line with The International Private Equity and Venture 
Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines and IFRS 13 “Fair Value 
Measurement”. Next to this, we verified the existence of these 
investments as of 31 December 2023 through external 
confirmations. 
We evaluated the reasonableness of inputs used in the valuation 
models and assumptions made by the board as part of their 
valuation process, by performing validation procedures using 
external data where relevant and underlying source 
documentation. For a sample of investment valuations, we 
obtained the valuation models and compared objective inputs 
used in the models to agreements or underlying source 
documents as provided by the Company. Furthermore, we tested 
the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models. In addition, 
we evaluated subsequent events and transactions and considered 
whether they corroborated or contradicted the year-end 
estimates. 
Finally, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the 
disclosures related to the fair value measurement of these 
investments in conformity with EU-IFRSs.
Key 
observation
s
Based on our procedures performed we consider the valuation of 
investments accounted for at fair value as at 31 December 2023 to 
be reasonable.
Reliability and continuity of the IT environment
Risk
Flow Traders’ activities and financial reporting are highly 
dependent on the reliability and continuity of the IT environment. 
Effective general IT controls with respect to change management, 
logical access, infrastructure and operations, support the integrity 
and continuity of the IT systems as well as the operating 
effectiveness of the automated controls.
As described in the Operational risk section in Note 34 in the 
financial statements for Flow Traders, the level of investment in 
technology is important to mitigate technology risks as well as 
having resilient and robust internal systems and controls.  There is 
a risk that the general IT control measures may not always operate 
as intended. The dependency on the IT environment could lead to 
undetected misstatements in financial reporting. Therefore we 
considered the reliability and continuity of the IT environment a 
key audit matter.

Our audit 
approach
With the help of IT audit professionals, who are an integral part of 
the audit team, we assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT 
environment to the scope necessary for the audit of the financial 
statements. In this context, we obtained an understanding of the 
main IT processes and evaluated the design and existence of 
general IT controls. We performed these procedures for the IT 
applications relevant to the scope of our audit as well the IT tools 
in support of the IT processes. We also performed specific 
procedures in response to findings on the documentation of the 
existence of general IT controls related to manage change for 
entity programmed changes regarding user acceptance testing.
We also obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of 
Flow Traders’ IT operations measures in place. For the applications 
that are supplied by third parties, we evaluated the monitoring 
process of Flow Traders for these service providers. 
Furthermore, we gained insight into the procedures, internal 
controls and reports that Flow Traders carries out with regard to 
cybersecurity.
Key 
observation
s
Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify any risks 
materializing from design and existence of general IT controls 
impacting the reliability and continuity of the IT environment in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements.

Report on other information included in the annual report
The annual report contains other information in addition to the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other 
information:
▪
Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material 
misstatements
▪
Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code for the management report and the other information as required by 
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and as required by Sections 2:135b and 
2:145 sub-section 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the remuneration report. 
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding 
obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have 
considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By 
performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 
2 and Section 2:135b sub-Section 7 of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Standard 
720 and ISA 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than 
the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF
Engagement
We were engaged by the Supervisory Board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V., as 
predecessor of Flow Traders Ltd on 19 May 2016, as of the audit for the year 2016 
and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that date.
European Single Electronic Reporting Format (ESEF)
Flow Traders Ltd has prepared the annual report in ESEF. The requirements for 
this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to 
regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting 
format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).
In our opinion the annual report prepared in the XHTML format, including the 
(partially) marked-up consolidated financial statements as included in the 
reporting package by the company, complies in all material respects with the RTS 
on ESEF.
The board is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial 
statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the board combines 
the various components into a single reporting package.
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the 
annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.
We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch 
Standard 3950N, ”Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor 
het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument” (assurance 
engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our 
examination included amongst others:
▪
Obtaining an understanding of the company’s financial reporting process, 
including the preparation of the reporting package
▪
Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in 
all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing
▪
further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for 
our opinion, including:
▪
Obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine 
whether the reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document 
and the XBRL extension taxonomy files, has been prepared in accordance with 
the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF
▪
Examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in 
the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been 
applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.

Description of responsibilities regarding the financial 
statements
Responsibilities of the board for the financial statements
The board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with EU-IFRSs and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code. Furthermore, the board is responsible for such internal control as the board 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board is responsible for 
assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the 
financial reporting framework mentioned, the board should prepare the financial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board either 
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. The board should disclose events and circumstances that 
may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee undertakes preparatory work for the board’s decision-
making regarding the supervision of the integrity and quality of the company’s 
financial reporting. Working within the board, the Audit Committee is charged in 
particular with the supervision with respect to the provision of financial 
information by the company.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that 
allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, 
which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and 
the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional 
skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing 
and ISAs, ethical requirements and independence requirements. The Information 
in support of our opinion section above includes an informative summary of our 
responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.
Our audit further included among others:
▪
Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion
▪
Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control
▪
Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the 
board
▪
Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial 
statements, including the disclosures
▪
Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Communication
We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear 
on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine the 
key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in

Provisions in the Bylaws governing the 
appropriation of profit:
The provisions in the Bylaws governing the 
appropriation of profit read as follows: 
Dividends and other payments 
1.
Dividends and Distributions. Subject to these 
Bye-laws, the Board may from time to time 
declare dividends or distributions out of 
contributed surplus to be paid to the 
Shareholders according to their rights and 
interests, including such interim dividends as 
appear to the Board to be justified by the 
position of the Company. The Board, in its 
discretion, may determine that any dividend shall 
be paid in cash or shall be satisfied, subject to 
Bye -Laws 5.2, 35.1 and 35.2, in paying up in full 
shares in the Company to be issued to the 
Shareholders credited as fully paid or partly paid 
or partly in one way and partly the other. The 
Board may also pay any fixed cash dividend 
which is payable on any shares of the Company 
half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the 
Board, justifies such payment. In making any 
determination regarding the declaration of a 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, the Board must, in addition to any other 
obligations or duties under the Companies Acts 
or these Bye-Laws, consider the Stakeholder 
Interests. 
2. Implementation. Except insofar as the rights 
attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share 
otherwise provide: (a) all dividends or 
distributions out of contributed surplus may be 
declared and paid according to the amounts paid 
up on the shares in respect of which the dividend 
or distribution is paid, and an amount paid up on 
a share in advance of calls may be treated for the 
purpose of this Bye-Law as paid-up on the share; 
(b) dividends or distributions out of contributed 
surplus may be apportioned and paid pro rata 
according to the amounts paid-up on the shares 
during any portion or portions of the period in 
respect of which the dividend or distribution is 
paid. 
3. Deductions. The Board may deduct from any 
dividend, distribution or other monies payable to 
a Shareholder by the Company on or in respect of 
any shares all sums of money (if any) presently 
payable by him to the Company on account of 
calls or otherwise in respect of shares of the 
Company. 
4. No Interest. No dividend, distribution or other 
monies payable by the Company on or in respect 
of any share shall bear interest against the 
Company. 
5. Method of Payment. (a) Subject to Bye-Law 
33.5(b), any dividend, distribution or interest, or 
part thereof payable in cash, or any other sum 
payable in cash to the holder of shares may be 
paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post 
or by courier addressed to the holder at their 
address in the Register or, in the case of joint 
holders, addressed to the holder whose name 
stands first in the Register in respect of the 
shares at their registered address as appearing in 
the Register or addressed to such person at such 
address as the holder or joint holders may in 
writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant 
shall, unless the holder or joint holders otherwise 
direct, be made payable to the order of the 
holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order 
of the holder whose name stands first in the 
Register in respect of such shares, and shall be 
sent at their or their risk and payment of the 
cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is 
drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the 
Company. Any one of two (2) or more joint 
holders may give effectual receipts for any 
dividends, distributions or other monies payable 
or property distributable in respect of the shares 
held by such joint holders. (b) All dividends, 
distributions or interests in respect of shares held 
by a securities depository, including Euroclear 
Nederland, shall be paid by placing those 
dividends, distributions or interest at the disposal 
of such securities depository, subject to and in 
accordance with the regulations of such 
securities depository. 
6. Unclaimed Amounts. Any dividend or distribution 
out of contributed surplus unclaimed for a period 
of five (5) years from the date of declaration of 
such dividend or distribution shall be forfeited 
and shall revert to the Company and the 
payment by the Board of any unclaimed 
dividend, distribution, interest or other sum 
payable on or in respect of the share into a 
FLOW TRADERS | ANNUAL REPORT 2023   
 
 
 
 
 
177

## Page 178

separate account shall not constitute the 
Company a trustee in respect thereof. 
7. In-Kind Satisfaction. The Board may also, in 
addition to its other powers, direct payment or 
satisfaction of any dividend or distribution out of 
contributed surplus wholly or in part by the 
distribution of specific assets, and in particular of 
paid-up shares or debentures of any other 
company, and where any difficulty arises in 
regard to such distribution or dividend, the Board 
may settle it as it thinks expedient, and in 
particular, may authorize any person to sell and 
transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions 
altogether, and may fix the value for distribution 
or dividend purposes of any such specific assets 
and may determine that cash payments shall be 
made to any Shareholders upon the footing of 
the values so fixed in order to secure equality of 
distribution and may vest any such specific 
assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the 
Board, provided that such dividend or 
distribution may not be satisfied by the 
distribution of any partly paid shares or 
debentures of any company without the sanction 
of a Resolution.
Reserves
8. Reserves. The Board may before declaring any 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, set aside such sums as it thinks proper as 
reserves which shall, at the discretion of the 
Board, be applicable for any purpose of the 
Company and pending such application may, also 
at such discretion, either be employed in the 
business of the Company or be invested in such 
investments as the Board may from time to time 
think fit. The Board may also without placing the 
same to reserve carry forward any sums which it 
may think it prudent not to distribute. 
Capitalization of profits
9. Capitalization. The Board may from time to time 
resolve to capitalize all or any part of any amount 
for the time being standing to the credit of any 
reserve or fund which is available for distribution 
or to the credit of any share premium account 
and accordingly that such amount be set free for 
distribution amongst the Shareholders or any 
class of Shareholders who would be entitled 
thereto if distributed by way of dividend and in 
the same proportions, on the footing that the 
same be not paid in cash but be applied either in 
or towards paying up amounts for the time being 
unpaid on any shares in the Company held by 
such Shareholders respectively or in payment up 
in full of unissued shares, debentures or other 
obligations of the Company, to be allotted and 
distributed credited as fully paid amongst such 
Shareholders, or partly in one way and partly in 
the other, provided that for the purpose of this 
Bylaw, a share premium account may be applied 
only in paying up of unissued shares to be issued 
to such Shareholders credited as fully paid.

are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and 
unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause circumstances or our actual results,
