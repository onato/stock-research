Dividend suspension (July 2024) eliminated income investor appeal. No clarity on dividend resumption timing.

Dividend suspension removes income component of return, making valuation purely dependent on capital appreciation. Analyst targets of €28.67 (+23%) insufficient for risk profile. Liquidity constraints (smaller free float, European listing) limit institutional ownership."
