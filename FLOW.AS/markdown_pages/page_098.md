are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized less any lease 
incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. 
Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Right-of-use assets are recorded 
in property and equipment and intangible assets on the Consolidated statement 
of financial position.
g)Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over the 
estimated useful lives of each component. The estimated useful life of significant 
intangible assets is 5 years.
h)Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL allowance”) for all loans and other 
debt financial assets not held at fair value through profit or loss is based on the 
credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected 
credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk 
since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ 
expected credit loss (12mECL). 
For other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating 
ECLs as these receivables relate to operating activities of the Group. Therefore, 
the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has 
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss 
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment. 
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 
90 days past due. However in certain cases, the Group may reconsider a financial 
asset to be in default when internal or external information indicated that the 
Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before 
taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial 
asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the 
contractual cash flows.Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax 
assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized if the 
carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and 
its fair value less cost of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets 
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which 
impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized 
in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investment is measured 
by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying 
amount. An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss, and is reversed if there 
has been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount.
