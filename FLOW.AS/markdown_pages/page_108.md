9.Hedge of net investments in foreign operations 
Included in Financial liabilities held for trading at 31 December 2024 is a short 
position of USD 8.7 million (2023: USD 19.3 million) which has been designated as 
a hedge of the net investment in the United States and Singapore subsidiaries, 
which have their functional currency in USD. This position is being used to hedge 
the Group’s exposure to the USD foreign exchange risk on this investment. Gains 
or losses on the retranslation of this translation are transferred to other 
comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net 
investments in the subsidiaries.There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the 
foreign exchange risk on the USD short position. The Group has established a 
hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to 
the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the 
amount of the investment in the foreign subsidiary becomes lower than the 
amount of the short position. The hedging gain recognized in other 
comprehensive income before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for 
measuring effectiveness. There is no ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss.
