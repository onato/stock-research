Valuation of (long-term) investments accounted for at fair value
RiskLong-term investments include investments measured at fair 
value through Other Comprehensive Income and through Profit 
or Loss. Flow Traders invests in private companies across all 
geographies, with an emphasis on three key themes: platform, 
data, and connectivity. These investments include warrants, 
tokens and equity stakes in the companies of which most are in 
the start-up and scale-up phase. 
At 31 December 2024, the investments measured at fair value 
through Other Comprehensive Income and Profit or Loss totaled 
to €57.8 million (2023: €26.6 million), as disclosed in Note 21 and 
Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. As 
described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, 
management estimates the fair value of (long-term) investments 
measured at fair value, by applying reference to their quoted 
closing bid price at the reporting date or, if unquoted, determined 
using a valuation technique using market observable and 
unobservable inputs and assumptions. Management judgment is 
required for these assumptions, which includes performance 
adjustments and discounts for liquidity.
Determining the fair value of investments using unobservable 
inputs and assumptions is a complex process and requires 
judgment from the board as these investments exhibit higher 
estimation uncertainty. Due to the matters described, we 
considered the valuation of investments accounted for at fair 
value a key audit matter.
Our audit 
approachWith involvement of our specialists, we obtained an 
understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of 
controls over the estimation of the valuation of the (long-term) 
investments and the appropriateness of the valuation 
methodologies applied, including the review of Flow Traders 
policies in line with The International Private Equity and Venture 
Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines and IFRS 13 “Fair Value 
Measurement”. Our audit 
approachWe evaluated the reasonableness of inputs used in the valuation 
models and assumptions made by the board as part of their 
valuation process, by performing validation procedures using 
external data where relevant and underlying source 
documentation. For a sample of investment valuations, we 
obtained the valuation models and compared objective inputs 
used in the models to agreements or underlying source 
documents as provided by the company. Furthermore, we tested 
the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models. In addition, 
we evaluated subsequent events and transactions and considered 
whether they corroborated or contradicted the year-end 
estimates. 
Finally, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the 
disclosures related to the fair value measurement of these 
investments in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards.
Key 
observationsBased on our procedures performed we consider the valuation of 
investments accounted for at fair value as at 31 December 2024 to 
be reasonable.
