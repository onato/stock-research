External AuditThe effectiveness of risk management is linked to 
commitment and integrity. It is crucial that the 
Board, the global and local department heads, as 
well as all employees are aware of the risks that our 
Company faces and their responsibilities in 
managing these effectively.
Our risk management is organized along three 
lines of defense. The first line of defense is 
comprised of Trading, Technology and Operations. 
These departments are critical for managing the 
core processes within Flow Traders and they are 
responsible for incorporating preventive and 
detective controls into the day-to-day trading and 
IT processes as well as for the continuous 
monitoring of our systems and trading controls.
The second line of defense is responsible for  
oversight and monitoring of risks, rules and 
requirements. Risk, Compliance, Legal and Finance 
manage risks through a combination of preventive 
and detective controls. Together they are 
responsible for the continuous risk management 
of the Company. 
On the second line we have the Financial & Capital 
Risk Committee and the Non-Financial Risk & 
Compliance Committee. The Financial & Capital 
Risk Committee includes oversight reporting and 
planning in relation to market, credit and treasury 
risk within the Company. Whereas the Non-
Financial Risk & Compliance Committee reviews a 
wide range of risks that are not directly related to 
financial matters, such as business and strategic 
risk, compliance and ethical risk, operational risk, 
operational risk and technology risk. The third line of defense is formed by Flow Traders’ Internal Audit function (IA). They provide independent and 
objective assurance and advice on the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control 
systems. This helps to achieve the competent application of systematic and disciplined processes, expertise, and 
insight. They report their findings to management and the governing body to promote and facilitate continuous 
improvement. The IA carries out its audit work in accordance with the approved and implemented Group 
Internal Audit Charter.
