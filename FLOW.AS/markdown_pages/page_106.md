e.Other assets held for trading 
Other assets held for trading comprises the amount of digital assets that the 
Group holds as a broker-dealer. The Group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets and 
these are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Group uses its own 
fair value models based on quoted prices or observable inputs for the valuation 
of the digital assets, these assets are classified as Level 2. 
f.Other liabilities held for trading
The Group borrows digital assets as part of its trading strategy. The borrowed 
digital assets are measured at fair value less cost to sell. As the Group uses its 
own fair value models based on quoted prices, observable inputs or 
unobservable inputs for the valuation of the borrowed digital assets, these 
liabilities are classified as Level 2 and Level 3. When the borrowed digital assets 
have an embedded derivative (see note 5(k)), the Group values the derivative 
using an option pricing model. See note 8(a) for additional information about the 
significant Level 3 inputs used.g.Fair value hierarchy
