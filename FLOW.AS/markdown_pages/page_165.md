This document contains "forward-looking statements" that relate to without limitation, our plans, objectives, 
strategies, anticipated developments in the industry in which we operate, and future operational performance. 
These forward-looking statements are often identified by terms such as "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend," 
"plan," "predict," "may," "will," "would," "should," "continue," "expect," and similar expressions, though not exclusively. 
Such forward-looking statements are to involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important 
factors that could cause circumstances or actual outcomes, results, performance, or achievements to differ 
materially from any future circumstances, results, performance or achievements expressed or implied. Key factors 
that may affect these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: reduced levels of overall trading 
volumes and lower margins; dependence on prime brokers, ETP issuers, trading counterparties, central 
counterparties (CCPs), and custodians; potential loss of access to important exchange or other trading venues; 
occurrence of systemic market events; incurrence of trading losses; disruptions or failures of our trading platform or 
third-party technical infrastructure; operational risks and challenges inherent to our business and trading activities; 
ineffective risk management systems processes and strategies; intense industry competition; reliance on 
continuous access to liquidity sources; capacity constraints in computer and communication systems; dependence 
on third-party software, infrastructure, or software availability; damage to our reputation and the reputation of our 
industry; loss of key staff or failure to attract and loss of key personnel or challenges in attracting and retaining 
skilled professionals; changes to applicable regulatory requirements; compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations specific to our industry; and enhanced media and regulatory scrutiny affecting public perception 
among other risks. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions, beliefs, and expectations derived 
from our industry experience, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future 
developments, and other factors we deem appropriate. Furthermore, any sustainability-related statements—
pertaining to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations—are based on the best evidence and 
information available to us at the time of this report. These statements, including those regarding future 
opportunities or risks, are inherently uncertain and subject to change as our understanding of ESG factors evolves. 
From a quantitative perspective, some of our sustainability metrics, such as emissions calculations, rely on estimates 
and external sources, including conversion factors. These estimates are based on current methodologies and 
sources, which may vary, leading to potential adjustments in reported figures over time. As such, the figures 
presented in this report should be understood as estimates that could change depending on the data sources or 
methods employed. While we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking and sustainability 
statements are reasonable as of the date they are made, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Therefore, you are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange 
regulations, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or 
sustainability metrics, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Any forward-looking 
statements should not be interpreted as guarantees of future performance or outcomes. If the risks or uncertainties 
materialize, or if the assumptions underlying our forward -looking statements prove inaccurate, our actual 
operational results, financial condition or sustainability outcomes could differ significantly from those anticipated, 
believed, estimated or expected. Statements regarding the market, industry trends, including the FX market, 
developments in ETP Assets under Management in specific markets, ETP value traded in certain markets and Flow 
Traders’ competitive position, are based on external data and sources. As these sources and methodologies evolve, 
so too may the information we present.
