The Group has outsourced collateral management to its prime brokers. It can 
receive and grant collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities in 
respect of the following transactions:
▪derivatives;
▪sale and repurchase, and reverse sale and repurchase agreements; and
▪securities lending and borrowing.
The Group receives and grants collateral in the form of cash and marketable 
securities as set out in  notes 18 and 27 in respect of derivatives (including swaps). 
Such collateral is subject to standard industry terms including, where 
appropriate, an ISDA Credit Support Annex. This means that securities received/
granted as collateral can be pledged or sold during the term of the transaction, 
but have to be returned on maturity of the transaction. The terms also give each 
party the right to terminate the related transactions on the counterparty’s failure 
to post collateral.
Offsetting
The Group has various netting agreements in place with counterparties to 
manage the associated credit risks. Such arrangements primarily include: 
securities borrowing and lending arrangements, and over-the-counter and 
exchange traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar 
arrangements generally enable the counterparties to offset liabilities against 
available assets received in the ordinary course of business and/or in the event of 
the counterparty’s default. The offsetting right is a legal right to settle, or 
otherwise eliminate, all or a portion of an amount due by applying an amount 
receivable from the same counterparty against it, thus, reducing credit exposure. 
However, the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 are not met in all cases.
