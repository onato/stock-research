8.Intergroup revenues
The Company generates revenues providing management services to its 
subsidiaries (customers). There were no other sources of revenue from contracts 
with customers. 
The Company’s performance obligation is to provide management services 
throughout the course of the year. The consideration for these services is 
recognized on a cost-plus margin arrangement, where the cost base is 
determined based on the costs incurred to provide the services. Revenue is 
recognized as and when the control of the services is transferred to the customers.
