Volatility

The discount for lack of marketability is driven by factors which include the 
contractual terms of each investment as well as time elapsed. Due to this, the 
range of DLOMs used as of the reporting date will change year over year to 
reflect the portfolio as of the reporting date.
A reasonably possible alternative assumption to the illiquidity discount is an 
increase or decrease of the percentage by 5% percent (2023: 5%). For investments 
measured at FVPL, this would increase/decrease the total fair value by €1.6 
million (2023: €837k) and for investments measured at FVOCI, this would 
increase/decrease the total fair value by a €621k (2023: €125k). 
A reasonably possible alternative assumption for applying the range of implied 
volatility would be to apply a 120 percent implied volatility for all other liabilities 
held for trading measured using a significant unobservable input of implied 
volatility. This would result in an increase in the total fair value of other liabilities 
held for trading by €172k (2023: €190k). If those instruments were to all have an 
80 percent implied volatility, the impact would be a decrease in the total fair 
value of other liabilities held for trading of €2.5 million (2023: €1.1 million). Assuming an increase in fair value of a liability is making it less negative, and a 
decrease in fair value of a liability making it more negative.
b.Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
The valuation of trading positions, both long and short positions, is determined 
by reference to last traded prices from identical instruments from the exchanges 
at the reporting date. Such financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1.
A substantial part of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading which are 
carried at fair value are based on theoretical prices which can differ from quoted 
market prices. The theoretical prices reflect price adjustments primarily caused 
by the fact that the Group continuously prices its financial assets and liabilities 
based on all available information. This includes prices for identical and near-
identical positions, as well as the prices for securities underlying the Group’s 
positions, on other exchanges that are open after the exchange on which the 
financial asset or liability is primarily traded closes. Consequently, such financial 
assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2.
For offsetting (delta neutral) positions, the Group uses mid-market prices to 
determine fair value.
c.Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income is determined by reference to their quoted closing bid 
price at the reporting date, or if unquoted, determined using a valuation 
technique and are classified as Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular 
availability of quoted closing bid prices. 
d.Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)
The fair value of investments measured at fair value through profit or loss is 
determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, 
or if unquoted, determined using a valuation technique and are classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3, conditional upon the regular availability of quoted closing bid 
prices.
