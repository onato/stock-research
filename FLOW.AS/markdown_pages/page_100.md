m) Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities on 
the Consolidated statement of financial position measured at the present value 
of lease payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present 
value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date. After the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease 
payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a change in the lease term or in case of other 
reassessments or modifications
n)Loans and borrowings
On initial recognition, loans and borrowings are measured at fair value plus or 
minus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using the effective-interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognized in 
profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR 
amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortization is included as finance expense in the statement of profit or loss. 
Please refer to Note 30 for additional information on loans and borrowings.
o)Income recognition 
Net trading income comprises gross trading income less fees and net financial 
expenses related to the trading activities. 
The fees and net financial expenses are directly linked to the trading activity and 
are therefore directly recognized in the profit and loss account under trading 
income.
p)Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax 
are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to a business 
combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive 
income.Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or 
loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of 
previous years. Current tax payable also includes any withholding tax liability 
arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
their tax bases. Deferred tax is not recognized for:
▪temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
▪temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will be revised in 
the foreseeable future; and
▪taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to 
temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into 
account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and 
interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are 
adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, 
including interpretations of tax law and management judgment. This 
assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgment 
about future events. New information may become available that would cause 
the Group to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax 
liabilities or the collectability of tax assets. Such changes will impact tax expense 
in the period that such a change in estimate is made.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the 
same tax authority on the same taxable entity which intend to settle current tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis or the tax assets and liabilities will be realized 
simultaneously.
