Board in control statement
The Executive Directors are responsible for the 
design, implementation and functioning of Flow 
Traders’ internal risk management and control 
systems. Flow Traders’ internal risk management and 
control is a process, effectuated by the Executive 
Directors, senior management and other personnel. 
It is designed to mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of 
objectives in the following categories:
▪Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
▪Reliability of financial and non-financial 
information; 
▪Compliance with laws, regulations and internal 
policies; 
▪Safeguarding of assets, identification and 
management of liabilities; and
▪Strategic goals of the Flow Traders Group.
The chapter Risk management elaborates on Flow 
Traders’ identified financial and non-financial risks 
and how these risks are managed. This chapter 
provides insight into the impact of these risks on our 
results. The design and functioning of the internal 
risk management and control systems is based on 
the ERMF. The framework explained in detail in the 
chapter Risk management, combines various 
financial and non-financial risk disciplines into a 
single converged approach and provides the 
business with an overview on their risks and how 
these are managed. The Risk department assessed 
the controls in this process and the findings have 
been presented to the Executive Directors and Non-
Executive Directors. This allows the Executive 
Directors and leadership to form a view on the 
internal risk management and control systems 
regarding the risks they face while pursuing 
Company’s strategy.
On the basis of the above and with due observance 
of the limitations stated below, we confirm that to 
the best of our knowledge:
▪The Annual Report provides sufficient insights 
into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems (see e.g. 
chapter Risk management);
▪The aforementioned systems provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial and tax reporting 
does not contain any material inaccuracies ;
▪Based on the current state of affairs and initial 
prognoses, it is justified that the financial 
reporting is prepared on a going concern basis 
(see e.g. chapters Financial statements and Other 
information); and
▪The report states material risks (if any) and 
uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation 
of the Company’s continuity for the period of 
twelve months after the preparation of the report 
(see e.g. chapters Our strategy and Our risk 
management).
The above does not imply that these systems and 
procedures provide absolute assurance to Flow 
Traders as to the realization of financial and strategic 
business objectives, or that internal risk 
management and control systems can prevent or 
detect all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud 
and noncompliance with legislation, rules and 
regulations.
