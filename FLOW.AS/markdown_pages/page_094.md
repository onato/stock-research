The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out below to all 
periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
General 
a)Basis of consolidation
The Group accounting policies have been applied consistently by all group 
entities. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and 
expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions 
with equity-accounted investments are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in 
the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an 
investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through power over 
the investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
Consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences 
until the date when control ceases.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary it derecognizes the assets and 
liabilities of the subsidiary, any related non-controlled interest and other 
components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. 
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when 
control is lost.
Equity-accounted investments
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but 
not control or joint control, over its financial and operating activities. A joint 
venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the 
Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its 
assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Interests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method and are recognized initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss
