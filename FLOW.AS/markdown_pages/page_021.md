Dividend Policy  
Flow Traders may or may not distribute out of the 
Company's net profits realized during the financial 
year to shareholders. The Company's Board may 
decide, in accordance with the Company's Bye-Laws 
and Board Rules, that the profits realized during a 
financial year will fully or partially be appropriated to 
increase and/or form reserves. A distribution of 
dividends is subject to applicable rules and 
regulations, the Company's Bye-Laws and the Board 
Rules. 
If applicable, dividends will be declared and paid 
following the publication of our results. There can be 
no assurance that in any given year a dividend will be 
proposed or declared. 
The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts 
and timing thereof, will depend on a number of 
factors, including future profits, financial conditions, 
general economic and business conditions, and 
future prospects and other factors the Board may 
deem relevant, as well as other legal and regulatory 
requirements. Our intentions in relation to dividends 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and 
uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our 
control.Reserves for 2024 
In July 2024 the Board announced its Trading Capital 
Expansion Plan and the related revision of its 
Dividend Policy. To expand the trading capital base, 
the Board has suspended regular dividend payments 
until further notice and did not pay an interim cash 
dividend for the financial year 2024. 
Capital requirements
Our prime brokers require the Company to maintain 
certain minimum capital levels. They leverage  
various internal systems to calculate required capital 
amounts (e.g., the ‘internal haircut model’ and the 
‘margin based approach model’, both intending to 
ensure sufficient levels of risk allowances) and have 
different limits structure, pre-funding possibilities. 
Margin requirements of prime brokers are 
conservatively determined by the sophistication of 
their models and the regulatory requirements, which 
might not necessarily be efficient in respect of our 
business model and trading portfolios.
The following table sets out the capital required to be 
posted with our prime brokers and capital available 
(net liquidation value).

FY 2025 are expected to be in the range of €190-210 
million given additional technology investments and 
targeted additions to FTEs in growth areas, offset 
somewhat by expected operational efficiency gains.
