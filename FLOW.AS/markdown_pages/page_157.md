Reliability and continuity of the IT environment
RiskFlow Traders’ activities and financial reporting are highly 
dependent on the reliability and continuity of the IT environment. 
Flow Traders has a complex IT landscape, with a part of the IT 
services outsourced to service organisations. Effective general IT 
controls with respect to change management, logical access, 
infrastructure and operations, support the reliability and 
continuity of the IT systems as well as the operating effectiveness 
of the automated business controls. Flow Traders as an 
internationally operating group, is inherently subject to higher 
risks of cybersecurity attacks. We refer to the risk category 
“Technology risk” as discussed in the Our risk management 
section of the annual report.
In our audit of the financial statements, we identified the risk that 
the general IT control measures may not always operate as 
intended. The dependency on the IT environment could lead to 
undetected material misstatements in financial reporting. 
Therefore, we considered the reliability and continuity of the IT 
environment a key audit matter.
Our audit 
approachWith the help of IT audit professionals, who are an integral part of 
the audit team, we assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT 
environment to the trading process and evaluated design and 
existence of general IT controls for the applications in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements. Our audit was not 
designed to express an opinion on the continuity and reliability of 
Flow Traders’ automated data processing (or parts thereof).
As part of our audit of the financial statements, we assessed the 
impact of changes to the IT environment during the year for the IT 
applications in scope of the audit of the financial statements. Our audit 
approachFurthermore, we performed the following procedures:
▪Evaluating the design of the IT general control processes and 
testing the operating effectiveness of IT general controls for 
the main IT processes being access management and change 
management. This was done for the IT applications in scope of 
our financial statements audit as well as for the underlying 
operating system including database management and 
tooling supporting access management and change 
management IT processes 
▪Designing and executing IT substantive procedures when IT 
general controls where lacking or not operating effectively. 
▪Reviewing relevant reports of vendors on the design and the 
operating effectiveness of controls when one or more of the 
main IT processes have been outsourced, including critical 
cloud computing outsourcing 
▪Testing application controls over the trading process and 
interfaces relevant to this process.
Our audit was not aimed at making a statement about the 
cybersecurity procedures, controls and reporting of Flow Traders. 
However, we did obtain an understanding of the cybersecurity 
procedures, controls and reporting as performed by Flow Traders.
Key 
observationsBased on our IT general controls testing procedures and IT 
substantive procedures performed, we have obtained sufficient 
assurance about the reliability and continuity of the IT 
environment relevant in the context of our financial statements 
audit.
