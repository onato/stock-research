2024  Long-term opportunities in digital assets align with our expertise across both TradFi 
and digital asset markets. Increased institutional and retail adoption, along with the 
launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., have driven a 826% growth in ETF AuM 2023 vs. 
2024. Additionally, accelerated growth in stablecoins reflects the sector’s increasing 
strength. The stablecoin market cap is estimated at $189 billion end of 2024, up 53% 
year-on-year.

regulations As electronic trading advances, it aligns well with our technology expertise. Credit 
algorithms now drive around 50% of Euro credit volumes, especially for trades under €1 
million. Fixed income ETF assets are also set to triple, from $2 trillion in 2023 to $6 
trillion by 2030.
In the EU, the final MiCAR implementation phase is ongoing with early signs of market 
adoption. In U.S., Asia and U.K. regulatory discussions are accelerating. Various 
significant changes to the bond transparency and reporting regimes will take effect in 
2025/26 and will impact the market. The upcoming global transition into T+1 
settlement already impacts ongoing regulatory proposals in the EU. AuM reached $14 trillion end of 2024 and is predicted to rise to $25 trillion by 2030, a 
significant acceleration that aligns with our core business growth. In 2024, spot Bitcoin
