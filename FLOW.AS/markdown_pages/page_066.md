The Non-Executive Directors identified the following 
key themes requiring continued attention in order to 
further strengthen the effectiveness of the Non-
Executive Directors and of the Board as such going 
forward: 
▪Global visibility and exposure of the Board vis-a-
vis employees
▪Structural learning and development of Board 
members, particularly regarding fast-evolving 
asset classes like digital assets
▪Clear delineation of roles and responsibilities 
between Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors
▪Board and committee meeting hygiene factors
The 2024 Non-Executive Director self-assessment 
also included an independence-assessment which 
was led by Rudolf Ferscha as Chairman of the Board 
and Linda Hovius as Chairwoman of the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee. As a 
result of this independence-assessment, the Non-
Executive Directors reconfirmed the independence 
of Rudolf Ferscha, Linda Hovius, Delfin Rueda, Paul 
Hilgers and Karen Frank. Jan van Kuijk was 
considered a Non-Independent Director.
The Executive Directors also evaluated their own 
functioning and performance as a group and 
individually. In the 2024 Executive Director self-
assessment, the focus was on the dynamics between 
and the functioning of the CEO, CFO and CTO, and 
further strengthening the joint strategic vision of the 
Executive Directors as a leadership team. It was 
further concluded that the capabilities and 
competencies of the Executive Directors are highly 
complementary to each other, especially with Owain 
Lloyd being elected as CTO as per the 2024 AGM and 
being in charge of driving the Company’s strategic direction with respect to all technology related 
matters.
The performance of the Executive Directors was 
discussed among the Non-Executive Directors, and 
with each Executive Director individually, on at least 
two separate occasions throughout the year. For a 
detailed overview of the performance reviews and 
the means by which these were conducted, 
reference is made to the Remuneration report as 
included in this Annual Report.
