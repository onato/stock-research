Our strategic pillar to optimize core and grow 
trading capital  was realized when we announced 
the introduction of our Trading Capital Expansion 
Plan in 2Q, which included the suspension of our 
dividend. Given the success of the Trading Capital 
Expansion Plan thus far, the firm will continue to 
pursue the most strategic debt financing options to 
further support the firm’s growth. 
Following this announcement, we focused on 
fostering investor trust and proactively engaging 
with stakeholders to ensure alignment with our 
growth and diversification strategy. Our expanded 
capital position strengthened our ability to deploy 
trading capital effectively across regions and asset 
classes, enabling us to seize trading opportunities 
throughout the year.
Leadership and expertise expansion  
As part of our commitment and strategic pillar 
technology and innovation , we have been advancing 
our technological capabilities, especially in light of 
the artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and machine 
learning. We took a significant step by appointing 
Owain Lloyd as Chief Technology Officer, he brings 
extensive expertise in emerging technologies, which 
will be instrumental as we navigate the rapidly 
evolving landscape in 2025 and beyond.
As a leadership team and throughout the firm, we 
are deeply committed to nurturing our teams' 
growth and enabling them to achieve exceptional 
results. We actively collaborate with organizations 
such as Women in ETFs, have established our own 
mentoring program, created a dedicated crypto 
talent pool (W3BWAVE), and pursued strategic 
partnerships to develop current and future talent.2024 dynamics and our role 
The financial markets are undergoing significant 
transformation, driven by trends that enhance 
infrastructure, improve trading systems, and create 
greater transparency and efficiency. 
In 2024, digital assets experienced accelerated 
growth and widespread adoption, with institutional 
interest surging significantly, particularly following 
the early-year launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This 
pivotal milestone served as a catalyst, firmly 
establishing digital assets as a viable and rapidly 
expanding asset class. As a firm, we strengthened 
our presence in the ecosystem by partnering with 
organizations such as Wormhole and Pyth, while also 
expanding our investments through Flow Traders 
Strategic Capital. In 2025, we are also set to launch 
AllUnity’s EUR-denominated regulated stablecoin 
with DWS and Galaxy, which we believe is set to 
further drive adoption, especially across institutions. 
These proof points all support our strategic pillar to 
diversify business model and revenue streams .
ETFs also continued their upward trajectory, 
becoming one of the most influential forces in 
today’s financial markets. With assets under 
management (AuM) surpassing record highs, the rise 
of thematic ETFs, as well as those focused on ESG 
and emerging sectors like digital assets, has 
broadened access to niche investment opportunities. 
As a trading firm with a strong presence in ETFs, we 
are well-positioned to facilitate this growth by 
providing liquidity and enhancing price discovery 
across markets.
Regulation continues to play a key role in shaping 
financial markets. As a participant across multiple 
markets and asset classes, we strongly advocate for 
robust and consistent regulatory frameworks. We 
believe such clarity enhances transparency and 
ultimately benefits end investors. In particular, the introduction of MiCAR in Europe and the 
implementation of T+1 settlement cycles highlight 
the importance of proactive collaboration between 
market participants and regulators, a responsibility 
we fully embrace.
The rapid advancements in big data, AI, machine 
learning, and other emerging technologies are set to 
redefine global financial markets. When effectively 
embraced, these innovations have the potential to 
create a more efficient and inclusive investment 
ecosystem for all participants. Recognizing this, we 
are intensifying our efforts to deploy cutting-edge 
technology and quantitative trading insights, 
ensuring we continue to deliver seamless execution 
and value for our stakeholders.
Looking ahead
We see tremendous opportunities for our Company 
and our people as we operate at the exciting 
intersection of TradFi and digital asset markets. We 
firmly believe that greater interaction between these 
ecosystems will make global financial markets more 
inclusive and accessible, benefiting all investors.
As a trading firm active in the digital asset space 
since 2017, we have leveraged our first-mover 
advantage to build a robust and trusted network of 
partners and a global trading infrastructure. This 
strong foundation, combined with our market 
leadership in ETFs, positions us to capitalize on 
emerging opportunities. Moreover, our strong capital 
position and ambitious growth plans motivate us to 
drive innovation and expansion. By fostering 
collaboration across the industry and prioritizing 
transparency, we aim to shape a financial ecosystem. 
that promotes trust, efficiency, and long-term value 
creation for all stakeholders.
