A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and 
deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date.

6.New standards and interpretations 
The Group has assessed all new standards, amendments and interpretations that 
are relevant to its operations and effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2024. These amendments do not have a material impact on the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
Additionally, the new IFRS issued but not yet effective for the 31 December 2024 
include:
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
IFRS 18, which replaces IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, introduces 
new requirements for presentation within the statement of profit or loss, 
including specified totals and subtotals. Furthermore, the Group is required to 
classify all income and expenses within the statement of profit or loss into one of 
five categories: operating, investing, financing, income taxes and discontinued 
operations, whereof the first three are new. 
It also requires disclosure of newly defined management-defined performance 
measures, subtotals of income and expenses, and includes new requirements for 
aggregation and disaggregation of financial information based on the identified 
‘roles’ of the primary financial statements (PFS) and the notes.
In addition, narrow-scope amendments have been made to IAS 7 Consolidated 
statement of Cash Flows, which include changing the starting point for 
determining cash flows from operations under the indirect method, from ‘profit 
or loss’ to ‘operating profit or loss’ and removing the optionality around classification of cash flows from dividends and interest. In addition, there are 
consequential amendments to several other standards. 
As of 31 December 2024, EFRAG has not endorsed IFRS 18. IFRS 18 is effective for 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, but earlier application is 
permitted and must be disclosed. IFRS 18 will apply retrospectively. The Group is 
currently working on identifying all impacts the amendments will have on the 
primary financial statements and notes to the financial statements. The Group 
will apply IFRS 18 at the effective date, early adoption is not expected. 
Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of exchangeability 
The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. EFRAG endorsed the amendment on 12 
November 2024 and the amendments are effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2025. 
Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 – Amendments to the Classification and 
Measurement of Financial Instruments
The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. EFRAG endorsed the amendment on 15 May 
2024 and the amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2026. 
IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures

apply IFRS 19. As of 31 December 2024, EFRAG had not endorsed the standard. 
The effective date of IFRS 19 is for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027.
IFRS Annual Improvements Volume 11

expected to have a material impact on the Group. As of 31 December 2024,
