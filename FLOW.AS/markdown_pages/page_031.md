Compliance and ethical risk 
Flow Traders continues to be a strong driver of 
effective, efficient and equal regulation and we 
contribute to the regulatory dialogue in our key 
jurisdictions to campaign for markets to be fair, 
transparent and functioning in an orderly manner.
Financial crime risk 
We are committed to complying with all relevant 
laws and regulations that apply to us, wherever we 
operate. Especially important are the rules around 
anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money 
laundering.
We also have anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-
money laundering policies in place that apply to all 
our employees. We expect our counterparties, 
business partners, intermediaries, contractors and 
subcontractors to adhere to the same standards. We 
believe that the risk of bribery or corruption is very 
limited as we do not hold or manage client money or 
assets. We trade financial instruments for our own 
account and own risk only. We do not maintain 
production facilities or source raw materials. 
Nevertheless, our employees receive regular training 
in anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering practices, as the Board would like to 
reinforce the importance of these policies. 
As part of our compliance framework, we also follow  
stringent KYC process as part of our onboarding of 
new counterparties and projects.    
Regulatory compliance risk
We trade with institutional counterparties and do 
not provide investment services or ancillary services 
to third parties; our markets and nearly all aspects of 
our business are highly regulated. Where applicable, 
entities forming part of our Company have obtained the regulatory licenses and approvals needed to 
operate their regulated businesses.
Flow Traders’ trading operations are established in 
three international jurisdictions, Amsterdam, New 
York and Hong Kong/Singapore with branch offices 
established in London, Milan, Paris, Chicago and 
Shanghai. As a Company, we currently trade on 180+ 
exchanges and trading venues worldwide as well as 
operating on numerous other venues through our 
brokers. Our regulatory landscape is broad as we 
have to comply not only with our local regulations, 
but also the trading rules of all venues on which we 
trade. 
Legislators and regulators globally continue to 
closely supervise the financial markets in which we 
operate. This places significant demand on Flow 
Traders to maintain a professional, well-structured 
and compliant organization. 
The Compliance, Risk and Operations departments 
have implemented controls, internal rules and 
processes that have been systematically developed 
following applicable regulatory requirements, 
guidelines from market authorities, and industry best 
practices. 
Actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable 
laws or regulatory requirements could adversely 
affect our reputation and in turn our long-term 
profitability and future business prospects. This may 
also be the case to a lesser degree for differences in 
interpretation or lack of timely or complete 
implementation of regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions could include fines, penalties, 
disgorgement and censures, suspension or expulsion 
from trading venues or the revocation or limitation of 
licenses. We aim to minimize such risks by focusing 
considerable management attention to choose the 
most appropriate strategic approach. We employ 
highly-qualified compliance and risk professionals to 
allow the deployment of staff training; to efficiently 
update of our monitoring and reporting systems; and 
to be able to continuously evaluate the impact of 
current and upcoming regulations on our operations 
to find the optimal path to evolve our processes. 
Notwithstanding such efforts and given the highly 
regulated nature of our business, we remain subject 
to routine (and more targeted) inquiries and audits 
from our global regulators and our trading venues. 
In the course of 2023, Flow Traders B.V. received an 
information request by the Authority Financial 
Markets (AFM) to investigate compliance with the 
Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Flow Traders 
duly provided all required documentation and 
complied in full with the request. In early 2024, the 
AFM notified Flow Traders that no formal 
proceedings would take place pursuant to this 
request. In parallel, the AFM and the Dutch Central  
(DNB) requested further information in order to 
investigate compliance with the Dutch Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act 
(WwFT). This information was delivered in full in the 
first half year of 2024.
As of 31 December 2024, the investigation made 
significant progress, with the DNB issuing their final 
findings, which were deemed sufficient with 
comments. In early 2025, the AFM detailed their 
findings from the investigation under the WwFT. 
Currently, the AFM is not proceeding with imposing 
any formal measures against Flow Traders BV. We 
remain committed to implementing measures to 
address and resolve any identified shortcomings and 
findings and further strengthening our controls.
