Remarks on GHG emissions data metrics
For scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, Flow Traders 
applies the operational control approach for the 
consolidation of its CO 2e emissions footprint. This 
means that Flow Traders accounts for all emissions 
from the operations over which it has control. The 
operations, i.e. office locations, as presented on the 
right have therefore been included in this CO 2e 
emissions footprint calculation.

In addition to the office locations, the use of server 
space from data centers is particularly relevant to 
Flow Traders’ business activities. These have been 
included in the scope 3 CO 2e emissions footprint 
calculation. Due to the confidentiality of the 
information, the locations of the data centers will not 
be disclosed. Data quality 
The calculated CO 2e footprint of GHG emissions 
emitted, through Flow Traders’ own business 
activities and those through its value chain, contains 
several factors of uncertainties, primarily due to 
limitations in the availability of actual emissions data. 
Flow Traders obtains third party data from service 
providers for its scope 1, 2 and 3 results. By default, we 
request actual CO₂e data from our landlords and 
utility providers (for scope 1 and 2) and from our value 
chain (for scope 3). However, at this stage, most are 
unable to provide actual CO₂e data. As a result, we 
rely on primary or secondary estimation methods 
based on factors such as energy consumption (kWh), 
distance traveled (km), and expenditure to calculate 
our footprint. We consider that actual emissions data 
will come over time as our suppliers may be subject 
to CSRD reporting or due the increased request from 
their value chain.
The table on next the page provides an overview of 
the calculation methods, uncertainties and data 
limitations for each emission category included in 
the calculation. 
Miscellaneous 
Facilitated emissions
The Facilitated Emissions Standard aims to increase 
transparency across this category of financial  
transactions. The standard covers the primary 
issuance of capital markets instruments and loan 
syndication. A primary issuance refers to new 
securities to provide debt-based or equity-based 
financing, including new issuance of various types of 
bonds issued for general purposes, common stock, 
equity and debt investments in private companies, 
preferred shares, and syndicated loans.We have reviewed the Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials (PCAF) framework and 
concluded that facilitated emissions are not 
applicable to Flow Traders, whereas Flow Traders 
operates in the secondary markets and does not 
involve with primary issuance of capital or financial 
instruments. 
Social impact assessment
From review of Reporting Framework methodology 
outlined by the United Nations Guiding Principles 
(UNGP) on Business and Human Rights, Flow Traders 
has identified risks related to social, human rights. 
These is focused exclusively on our own operations. 
While Flow Traders has policies in place to promote 
ethical practices, human rights-related issues may 
still arise. Most risks are considered low, reflecting our 
values and inclusive workplace culture. However, 
some areas, particularly those involving cultural or 
individual differences, such as freedom of expression 
and rest, carry a potential medium to high impact if 
not carefully managed. Flow Traders plans to adopt 
targeted initiatives, like fostering mental health and 
encourage open communication in order to further 
mitigate these risks.
