Every year, we conduct Risk Control Self Assessments (RCSA) across the 
organization to update what our main inherent risks are and which could be the 
most impactful in order to manage them to be within our risk appetite. 
Any breach of risk appetite is escalated to management. A decision is then made 
as to whether we should mitigate, defer or accept the breach. If mitigation is 
considered to be the appropriate action, a taskforce is put in place to bring back 
the residual risk scoring within our risk appetite. This ongoing vigilance ensures, 
that we dedicate the appropriate amount of time and resources to improve our 
control environment in a consistent and risk-based manner.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and can also arise from the 
settlement of off-exchange transactions.
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is 
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the Consolidated 
statement of financial position. These amounts significantly exceed expected 
loss in the event of counterparty default, as expected loss takes into account the 
likelihood of such an event and collateral or security. The likelihood of 
counterparty default is deemed to be remote due to the creditworthiness of the 
counterparties and the central counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk at the reporting date was as follows:
Carrying amount As at 31 December
2024 2023 (restated)
Cash and cash equivalents 8,389 5,708
Trading receivables 5,960,221 5,647,163
Other receivables 35,464 20,675
Credit risk related to transactions on exchanges is limited since these are 
guaranteed by the central counterparty or clearing house related to that 
exchange. Members of these clearing houses are required to deposit substantial 
amounts of cash, bonds or equities as collateral for any failure to settlement of 
trading. There is an inherent risk related to transactions on digital asset 
exchanges and protocols, both centralized and decentralized. Additionally, this 
risk is mitigated by strict onboarding procedures and limiting the assets held for 
trading on each exchange to limit the maximum risk per exchange. The Group manages credit risk through its Risk department that provide specific 
guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, measuring and reporting credit 
risk.
Policies include amongst others:
▪limits for individual product types;
▪limits per counterparty;
▪limits on the duration of the exposure;
▪limits for settlement types;
▪strict monitoring procedures for late settlements;
▪limits to exchanges.
Creditworthiness of counterparties is continuously assessed and counterparty 
exposures are monitored on an intraday basis.
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The disclosures set out in this paragraph include financial assets and financial 
liabilities that:
▪are offset in the Group’s Consolidated statement of financial position; or
▪are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar 
agreement that covers similar financial instruments, irrespective of whether 
they are offset in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
The similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master 
repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. 
Similar financial instruments include derivatives, sales and repurchase 
agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and 
securities lending agreements. Financial instruments, such as loans and 
deposits, are not disclosed in this paragraph unless they are offset in the 
Consolidated statement of financial position.
The ISDA and similar master netting arrangements do not meet the criteria for 
offsetting in the Consolidated statement of financial position. This is because 
they create a right to offset recognized amounts for the parties to the agreement 
that is enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of 
the Group or the counterparties or following other predetermined events.
In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net 
basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
