and the Americas. In this context, it is possible that tax exposures which have not 
yet materialized may result in different interpretation of local rules. As of 31 
December 2024, management concluded that it is probable that the tax 
authority in the Netherlands will accept our treatment of earnings stripping 
rules. It is possible that different interpretation of local rules may result in tax 
effects from timing differences.
Contingent Assets
Flow Traders Investment Limited (FTIL) held both digital assets and fiat currency 
on FTX Trading Ltd.’s (FTX) digital asset exchange prior to FTX filing bankruptcy 
in November 2022. As a result of that bankruptcy, FTIL derecognised their 
balances held on FTX’s platform during the year ended 31 December 2022. FTIL 
subsequently filed a customer claim with the bankruptcy estate in September 
2023. As a result of the filing, FTIL is an FTX Debtor under the bankruptcy 
proceedings.
During the year ending 31 December 2023, FTX announced a proposed 
settlement plan which included a Preference Settlement Amount. The 
Preference Settlement Amount allowed FTX Debtors the opportunity to resolve 
any liabilities and claims with FTX on a net basis. As of 31 December 2023, the 
Group has concluded that an inflow of economic benefit from the Preference 
Settlement Amount was probable, but not virtually certain (hence, no asset had 
been recognized as of 31 December 2023). On 25 March 2024, the Group sold its 
claim.
