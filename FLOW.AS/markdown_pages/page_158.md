Report on other information included in the Annual Report
The annual report contains other information in addition to the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other 
information:
▪Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material 
misstatements
▪Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code 
for the management report (excluding a sustainability statement) and the other 
information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding 
obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have 
considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By 
performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 
of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Standard 720 and ISA 720. The scope of the 
procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our 
audit of the financial statements.
The board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the 
management report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and 
other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of Flow Traders N.V., as 
predecessor of Flow Traders Ltd., on 19 May 2016, as of the audit for the year 2016 and 
have operated as statutory auditor ever since that date.
European Single Electronic Reporting Format (ESEF)
Flow Traders Ltd. has prepared the annual report in ESEF. The requirements for this 
are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory 
technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format 
(hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).In our opinion the annual report prepared in the XHTML format, including the 
(partially) marked-up consolidated financial statements as included in the reporting 
package by the company, complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.
The board is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial 
statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the board combines the 
various components into a single reporting package.
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the 
annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.
We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch 
Standard 3950N, ”Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het 
opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument” (assurance engagements 
relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our examination included 
amongst others:
▪Obtaining an understanding of the company’s financial reporting process, 
including the preparation of the reporting package
▪Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in all 
material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further 
assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, 
including:
▪Obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine 
whether the reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document 
and the XBRL extension taxonomy files, has been prepared in accordance with 
the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF
▪Examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in 
the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been 
applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF
