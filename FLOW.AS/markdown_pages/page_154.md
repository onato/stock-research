Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of 
most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have 
communicated the key audit matters to the audit committee. The key audit 
matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. 
In comparison with previous year, the nature of our key audit matters did not 
change.
Fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities held for trading
RiskAt 31 December 2024 the financial assets held for trading (long 
positions in equity, debt securities-trading and mark to market 
derivatives asset) amounted to €6.1 billion (2023: €5.6 billion) and 
the financial liabilities held for trading (short positions in equity, 
debt securities-trading and mark to market derivatives liabilities) 
amounted to €4.2 billion (2023: €3.2 billion), as disclosed in Note 
17 and Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements, 
respectively. Flow Traders’ fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities held for trading is based on internally 
determined theoretical prices as disclosed in Note 8 to the 
consolidated financial statements. These prices can differ from 
closing prices at various stock exchanges or prices from clearers, 
due to market illiquidity, variety in opening hours of the stock 
exchanges and the prices used for identical or near-identical 
positions.
The fair values recorded require judgment which represents a 
risk of improper adjustments directly impacting the gross 
trading income. Therefore, we considered the valuation of 
financial assets and liabilities held for trading a key audit matter.Our audit 
approachOur audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the 
appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies related to 
valuation of financial assets and liabilities according to IFRS 9 
“Financial Instruments”, IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”. In 
addition, we obtained an understanding of the valuation process, 
including verifications done by the company. We evaluated the 
design and implementation of internal controls relevant to fair 
value measurement.
Furthermore, we performed the following procedures:
▪Risk-based sample testing on the valuation of individual 
positions by evaluating the internally determined theoretical 
prices against market prices from independent sources
▪Independent verification of year end positions with third 
parties (clearers, banks, exchanges) to verify the positions in 
financial assets/liability held for trading as at 31 December 
2024
▪Subsequent cash receipt testing in January 2025 for 
transactions recorded directly after 31 December 2024 to 
evaluate the valuation of financial assets and liabilities held 
for trading
▪Cut-off procedures to ensure that transactions are recorded 
in a correct period 
Furthermore, we evaluated the presentation and disclosure in 
the financial statements for compliance and consistency with 
IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure” and IFRS 13 “Fair Value 
Measurement” on disclosure requirements for financial assets 
and liabilities held for trading, including the fair value hierarchy.
Key 
observationsBased on our procedures performed, we consider the fair value 
of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading to be 
reasonable as at 31 December 2024.
