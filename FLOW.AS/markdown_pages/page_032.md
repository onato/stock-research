Conduct risk
Given the highly interconnected nature of the 
financial markets ecosystem we are a part of, we 
recognize that should any of the risks referenced 
within this section materialize, there could be a 
negative impact on various external third parties.
Specifically, market and operational risk events could 
negatively impact key parties within our value chain, 
namely our counterparties and our prime brokers. 
This could limit our counterparties’ ability to trade 
with us or to do settlement trades effectively on a 
timely basis. Moreover, the various prime brokers we 
work closely with could also be exposed to similar 
risks.
We believe that each employee has an individual and 
collective responsibility for ensuring an honest and 
ethical business conduct within our Company. 
Therefore, our Code of Conduct, forms part of our 
employment documentation.
Ensuring adherence with our Code of Conduct is the 
responsibility of the Executive Directors and the  
senior leadership. Any reported potential breaches 
are investigated fully by members of our senior 
leadership team in accordance with existing clearly 
laid out procedures and policies. Our Code of 
Conduct can be found on our website. 
In addition to our culture of openness, transparency 
and participation, we also have detailed 
Whistleblower Policy in place for all employees and 
relevant contractors, approved by our Executive  
Directors. 
The Whistleblower Policy also provides any 
whistleblower with anonymity, confidentiality, and 
the Company will not impose sanctions on disclosure 
(or affect an employee’s legal position) when the 
employee reports a suspected misconduct in good faith, unless the employee is involved in the issue 
that is being reported. We respect a non-retaliation 
approach when a suspected misconduct is reported. 
Our Whistleblower Policy can be found on our 
website. 
Operational risk 
Business continuity risk 
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, 
systems or external events. Operational risk 
management is an integral part of our risk and 
control systems. Our operational risk is dominated by 
technology-related events at our exchanges and 
clearing members. Therefore, the level of our 
investment in technology is important to mitigate 
those associated risks as well as having resilient and 
robust internal systems and controls. 
We operate an integrated, in-house developed, high-
performance and customized technology platform 
with frequent and controlled deployments of new 
hardware and software. 
Our infrastructure has a modular design which 
allows us to rapidly test and implement 
improvements in both hardware and software on an 
ongoing basis. Controlled releases of hardware and 
software enhancements provide for minimal 
disruption to our business. 
The environment in which our trading software (or 
updates of our trading software) is being developed 
is strictly separated from the environment in which 
such trading software operates in production. Access 
to the source code is strictly controlled and limited. 
Prior to any releases relating to our trading software, 
or an update into our production environment, any 
element of our trading software is subjected to a review of its code, testing in a development 
environment that is separate from our production 
environment. Furthermore, validation occurs on  
limited production (processing a strictly limited 
number of trades) and on one trading desk in 
respect of trading a single financial instrument, 
followed by more extensive testing across multiple 
desks and/or trading multiple financial instruments. 
Each step must be completed before the next and 
also appropriately documented. 
We have a monitoring system in place to control 
undisrupted trading activities in real time. Multi-layer 
monitoring is employed to avoid errors. When an 
error does occur, the relevant teams are immediately 
notified via multiple different channels. We rely on 
multiple third-party service providers for business 
and market data, which is a key part of what is 
monitored. 
Our risk management system is fully integrated with 
our proprietary technology platform, analyzing real-
time pricing data, and is designed to ensure that our 
order activity is conducted within strict 
predetermined trading and position limits. For 
example, our pre-trade [risk] controls are designed to 
prevent the trading engines from sending quotes 
that deviate from our predefined risk parameters. 
These include price and volume limits, which are 
independently set and monitored by our Risk 
function. This keeps our ordering, trading and 
positions well within our preset tolerance levels. Our 
post-trade monitoring tools include trade-level 
reconciliation of prices and positions against those of 
our exchanges and prime brokers.
Our IT systems are regularly subjected to penetration 
tests by external experts. We have a comprehensive 
IT security system that is designed to protect us from 
attacks both from internally and externally.
