c)Functional and presentation currency
These Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the 
functional currency of the parent company, Flow Traders Ltd.  All financial 
information presented in euros has been rounded to the nearest thousand, 
except when otherwise indicated.
d)Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of these Consolidated financial statements requires 
management to form opinions and make estimates and assumptions that 
influence the reported value of assets and liabilities and of income and 
expenditure. The actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Information about estimates and judgments made in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the 
Consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: 
▪Note 8: Fair value measurement
▪Note 13: Share based payments 
▪Note 33: Provisions and contingencies
During the current year, the Group further refined their application of estimates 
to the fair value measurement of investments held at fair value through profit or 
loss and through other comprehensive income. These estimates exclusively 
relate to strategic investments in the digital asset sector. This sector continues to 
evolve with increases in market participant sophistication, available investment 
products and historical results. As a result of this evolution, the Group’s 
methodology to form estimates of significant unobservable inputs (see note 8) 
has evolved and changed. The Group has concluded that the effect of this 
change should be accounted for as a change in estimate. Please see note 8h for 
the impact in the current year. The Group has not calculated the effect on future 
periods as estimating the effect on fair value would be impracticable given the 
interdependencies on assumptions, which include active market prices.
e)Principles for the preparation of the Consolidated statement 
of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities are presented in the Consolidated 
statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Cash flows from investing 
activities and financing activities are presented in the Consolidated statement of 
cash flows using the direct method.The cash flows are split into cash flows from operations, investment activities and 
financing activities. Receivables from and payables to clearing organizations are 
included in the cash flow from operating activities. The Group has elected to 
classify interest received and interest paid as cash flows from operating activities 
when generated from principal revenue-producing activities. The Group has 
elected to classify interest paid or received on all other activities as financing 
activities. 
Investment activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in 
respect of financial investments other than in the course of operations, as well as 
acquisitions and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. 
Financing activities include the payment of dividends to shareholders, the (re)-
purchase of shares, the issuance and repayment of financial debt, including 
financial lease liabilities, and capital contributions.
4. Restatement o f prior period errors
Restatement 1
The Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023 has 
been restated for the effect of incorrect recognition of certain derivative 
contracts. For these contracts only an asset or liability should had been 
recognized depending on the contract’s gain or loss position. However, notional 
amounts have been incorrectly recognized as both assets and liabilities, despite 
not meeting the recognition criteria in IFRS 9. Additionally, these derivative 
contracts were previously presented within trading receivables and trading 
payables and should have been presented as financial assets or liabilities held for 
trading. There was nil impact on the statement of profit or loss and nil impact on 
retained earnings. 
Restatement 2
The Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023 has 
been restated for the effect of incorrect presentation for stablecoins (digital 
assets) as trading receivables and trading payables. Digital assets are presented 
as other assets and liabilities held for trading and accounted for as inventory 
under IAS 2.  Trading receivables and trading payables are financial assets and 
liabilities accounted for under IFRS 9. There was nil impact on the statement of 
profit or loss and nil impact on retained earnings. 
Please see the table below for impact on the Consolidated statement of financial 
position and Consolidated statement of cash flows.
