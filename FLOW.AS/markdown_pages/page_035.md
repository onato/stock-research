Sustainability information 
General basis of preparation for the 
sustainability information  
The sustainability information in this Annual Report 
covers the material topics identified following our 
2024 Double Materiality Assessment (DMA).
It provides an overview of Flow Traders’ metrics from 
1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024. This report 
complies with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive 
(NFRD) and the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
Flow Traders has volunteered to not report under 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 
as it is not transposed in Dutch law. We continue to 
monitor developments in relation to the adoption of 
the CSRD within Dutch legislation and the 
implications of the European Commissions’ Omnibus 
Announcement in February 2025. 
Governance of sustainability matters
We have established a governance structure that 
oversees the rollout of our ESG priorities, along with 
their associated impacts, risks, and opportunities 
(IROs). 
We manage sustainability through this structure that 
spans multiple organizational levels, ensuring 
accountability and execution. This includes the 
Board, the Risk & Sustainability Committee, the ESG 
team, theme owners, KPI action owners, and other 
topical experts. Sustainability expertise
Collectively the Board has a sufficient level of 
knowledge of sustainability to oversee its 
governance. Please see the skills and expertise 
matrix in the Board composition section of the Board 
report. Risk management of sustainability matters
Sustainability and environmental risk are defined in 
our internal policies as the risk that ESG (related) 
issues or events will impact the entity financially, 
non-financially and/or in the realization of strategic 
objectives of the entity. Our leadership is charged 
with monitoring the sustainability and 
environmental risks via the Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework. Environmental and 
sustainability risks are monitored by our second line 
of defense.
