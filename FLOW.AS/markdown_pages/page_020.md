Our financial  performance 
Flow Traders delivered a strong financial 
and trading performance in 2024, driven 
by the introduction of our Trading Capital 
Expansion Plan. We recorded a net trading 
income (NTI) of € 467.8 million in 2024 
(2023: € 300.3 million). Our cost base and 
capital position remained solid as we 
continued to execute our growth and 
diversification strategy.Financial overview
Flow Traders recorded an NTI of €467.8 million in 
2024 (vs. € 300.3 million in 2023) reflecting the overall 
market and trading environment. Other income of  
€11.5 million was derived from the strategic 
investments portfolio (vs. € 3.6 million in 2023).
Europe, our home market, contributed the most to 
our NTI which reflects the region's high level of flow 
visibility, counterparty and product coverage as well 
as the fact that the growth business activities are 
typically located at our headquarter in Amsterdam. 
There were also significant contributions from APAC. 
The disciplined execution of our strategic growth 
agenda meant that investments we have made are 
yielding meaningful returns. 
On the cost side, fixed operating expenses decreased 
to €177.0 million for the year (€ 180.1 million in 2023). 
The decrease was due to one-off strategic advisory 
costs incurred in 2023, which was partially offset by 
an increase in technology costs and fixed employee 
expenses in support of our trading activities and 
further due to general price inflation.  FTEs were 
slightly lower this year 609 (2023: 613). Variable 
employee expenses increased to € 85.3 million (€ 53.9 
million in 2023) which is in line with the improved 
financial performance of the business during the 
period.
Given these income and cost dynamics, Flow Traders 
continued to demonstrate solid operational leverage 
with an EBITDA margin of 45.3% in 2024 (2023: 23.0%) 
with EBITDA of € 217.1 million (2023: € 69.8 million), 
due to the improved performance of the business. Profit for the year was € 159.5 million (2023: € 36.2 
million), with basic EPS of  €3.69 (2023: € 0.84).
Non-IFRS performance 
Non-IFRS financial measures are disclosed in 
addition to the statement of comprehensive income, 
in order to provide relevant information to better 
understand the underlying business performance of 
our Company. 
In 2024, we decided to simplify our use of non-IFRS 
measures and discontinued the use of normalized 
alternative performance measures to reduce 
complexity in financial reporting and to adhere to 
accounting best practices. 
Flow Traders has the following non-IFRS financial 
measures:
▪Fixed operating expenses:  Calculated as fixed 
employee expenses, technology expenses and 
other expenses. The measure provides a focused 
metric of the core operating expenses of the 
Company while removing the variable employee 
expenses which are dependent on current-year 
results
▪EBITDA:  Calculated as the operating result, before 
depreciation, amortization, and write-offs on 
intangible assets. EBITDA is used as it focuses on 
core trading and operational activities
