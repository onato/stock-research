“Our focus is on developing a 
reliable and robust risk 
management framework to 
effectively manage our risks 
continuously. Additionally, 
fostering a strong risk culture 
is equally important for our 
Company and requires 
ongoing attention.”Risk management
Flow Traders’ Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF) forms the foundation 
of our approach to managing risks. The 
ERMF is documented in Flow Traders’ 
Enterprise Risk Management Policy and is 
reviewed on an annual basis.Where possible, we identify, assess, monitor, quantify 
and document potential risks which are inherent to 
trading in an automated market-making firm. In the 
fast and dynamic environment of automated trading, 
we designed our ERMF in such a way that it is robust, 
efficient and transparent. In the figure below, we 
present the stakeholders that have an interest and 
place value in how our framework operates. Our ERMF helps us to ensure that we have adequate 
systems and controls including the management of 
our liquidity and capital. This is delivered through a 
consistent, continuous and careful method for 
addressing, managing and prioritizing our key risks 
in the context of our strategic goals.
