We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch

Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report.
We are independent of Flow Traders in accordance with the Wet toezicht 
accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening 
inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) 
and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we 
have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants 
(VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics for professional accountants). The ViO and VGBA are 
at least as demanding as the International code of ethics for professional 
accountants (including International independence standards) of the
