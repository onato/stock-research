The annual Risk Management Cycle follows 
the ERMF
Every year the Executive Directors and senior 
leadership establish strategic goals, generally in 
November/December, subsequently the business 
targets are set. Then, the Board approves both the 
strategic goals and business targets. 
Additionally, the Board is involved in the strategy 
setting exercise. Based on these long-term goals, 
short-term targets are determined. These targets are 
then translated into annual Company-wide, 
departmental and individual goals and discussed in 
an annual meeting with senior leadership. 
Based on the targets and objectives, the Executive 
Directors and senior leadership formulates the risk 
appetite of the Company. The targets, objectives and 
risk appetite give direction to the various 
departments within Flow Traders and are used to 
derive the Company’s strategic risks.Flow Traders’ Risk Management Cycle is used to 
identify, manage and mitigate our financial, non-
financial and compliance risks. The Risk 
Management Cycle consists of four recurring 
activities: risk identification & assessment, risk 
control, risk monitoring and risk reporting. The cycle 
is designed and implemented to determine and 
assess our risk, take mitigating actions to control our 
risk, monitor the effectiveness and developments of 
the taken measures and report findings and 
effectiveness of all measurements and actions taken. 
The Risk Management Cycle ensures that our 
residual risk profile remains in line with our annual 
set risk appetite and that emerging risks, changed 
risk levels or non-effective controls are identified, 
assessed and analyzed in a timely manner.
