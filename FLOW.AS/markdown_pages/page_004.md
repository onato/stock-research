Celebrating 20 years 
FLOW TRADERS  | ANNUAL REPORT 2024        3“In 2024, we proudly celebrated Flow Traders' 20th anniversary, this 
was an incredible milestone for our firm, our people, and our trusted 
partners. This year has been groundbreaking, showcasing the 
strength of our business model, the resilience of our team, and our 
commitment to innovation in global financial markets.
I am immensely proud of what we achieved in 2024. We delivered a 
strong financial performance, seizing emerging market 
opportunities and capitalizing on volatility. Beyond the financials, 
this year marked significant strides in advancing our strategic and 
commercial agenda, including the introduction of our Trading 
Capital Expansion Plan, which is a pivotal step in ensuring Flow 
Traders' long-term growth.
More broadly, we strongly believe we stand at a transformative 
moment in financial markets, operating at the intersection of 
traditional finance (TradFi) and digital asset markets. The shift 
towards a 24/7 trading environment is shaping the global financial 
landscape, and Flow Traders is uniquely positioned to lead this 
evolution. Our leading role in ETP trading, robust distribution 
network, strong pricing capabilities, and position as a first mover in 
digital assets equip us to drive growth. 
Our mission remains clear: to contribute to making global financial 
markets more transparent and efficient, ultimately reducing 
transaction costs, and increasing accessibility for all market 
participants. As digital assets continue to disrupt financial markets, 
we see immense potential for traditional and digital asset 
ecosystems to co-exist, complementing each other to create a more 
inclusive financial ecosystem. 
To our partners and counterparties, thank you for your unwavering 
support and collaboration. Together, we are paving the way for a 
more innovative and inclusive financial system.”
