Scope 3: Cat. 1 – 
Purchased services 
from data center 
server spaceCalculation based on secondary data method, by:
▪Total server space capacity purchased (from contract 
agreement / invoice) in kVa (kilo volt ampere) (APAC 
and US)
▪Server capacity for actual power draw (EMEA 
only).Note that one EMEA data center relies on 
contracted power usage. 
▪Converted kVa to full year kWh
▪Total server space capacity purchased (from contract 
agreement / invoice) in kW (kilo Watt) full year
▪The percentage of electricity consumption from 
renewable and non-renewable sources are as 
provided by the data center supplier
▪Multiplied by country specific emission factor of the 
electricity gridWe rely on confirmation from our data center service providers to determine the share of renewable 
electricity used. As of year-end 2024, the data center services providers were not able to provide the 
Green energy certificates for the reporting year due to timing, hence we used the most recent available 
certificates (2023) and requested a confirmation for 2024. Due to confidentiality, we do not disclose the 
exact number or locations of these data centers. Currently, no actual CO₂ emissions data is available from 
any data center service provider. Instead, we base our calculation on (1) contracted space capacity (2) For 
EMEA DCs we obtain actual power draw from the DCs into our internal reporting dashboard. There is one 
data center that is not included in the reporting dashboard where contracted power is used. Power 
usage is converted into CO₂ greenhouse gas emissions factors from Carbon Footprint ltd. Worldwide
Scope 3: Cat. 1 – 
Purchased goods 
from hardwareCalculation based on primary data method, by:
▪Spend-based method for scope 3 calculation
▪Total hardware related spend includes servers, 
storage hardware, networking peripherals, switches, 
laptops, screens, data communication, computers, 
racks and other hardware 
▪Multiplied by supply chain industry (NAICS) specific 
emission factorsSince we use a spend-based calculation, local pricing differences may lead to variations in the emissions 
calculated for the same product. Additionally, we rely on industry-specific emissions factors for the 
supply chain, which are sourced from public data and based on historical figures from previous years. 
There is data limitations at regional offices for all scope 3 categories. We use NAICS conversion factors to 
convert spend amounts into CO₂.EMEA excluding 
London and Cluj, 
APAC and U.S. 
Scope 3: Cat. 5 - 
Waste generated 
in operationsCalculation based on primary data method, by:
▪Waste amount in KG and waste treatment method 
(recycling, anaerobic digestion, landfill) as provided 
by the waste treatment handler
▪Total organic waste, general waste, plastics, drinks 
packaging and light metals (PDM), and paper and 
cardboard
▪Multiplied by average emission factors per disposal 
methodWe rely on average emissions factors per disposal method, which are sourced from public data and 
based on historical figures from previous years. We use the UK government Department of Environment, 
Fuels and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) conversion factors to convert waste into CO 2.Amsterdam
Scope 3: Cat. 6 – 
Business travelCalculation based on primary data method, by:
▪Itinerary of travel by air or railway
▪CO2 emissions per travel as provided by the travel 
service agencyOur data calculation includes all business travel booked through our designated travel agents in EMEA, 
APAC, and the Americas. However, business travel arranged outside these channels - such as trips 
booked individually by employees and reimbursed through expenses - is not included in the calculations.WorldwideGHG Protocol
