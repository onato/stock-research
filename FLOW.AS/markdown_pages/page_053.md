Functioning of the Board
The Board is responsible for the continuity of the 
Company and is guided by the interests of the 
Company and its associated business. The Board 
takes into consideration the Company’s sustainable 
long-term value creation and the interests of the 
Company’s stakeholders, including our employees 
and our shareholders. The Executive Directors are 
primarily charged with the Company's day-to-day 
operations, subject to the limitations set out in the 
Companies Act and our Bye-Laws. The Non-
Executive Directors are primarily charged with the 
supervision of the performance of the duties of the 
Executive Directors and assist by providing advice 
and direction. For a more detailed description of the 
governance concerning the Board, and the specific 
duties of the Executive Directors and the Non-
Executive Directors, please refer to the Company’s 
Bye-Laws and Board Rules on our website.
Board Committees
The Board may from time to time establish 
permanent or ad-hoc committees. As at the date of 
this Annual Report, the Board has established four 
committees: the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration & Appointment Committee, the Risk & 
Sustainability Committee and the Trading & 
Technology Committee. The composition of each 
committee is reflected in the table following this 
paragraph. The composition did not change 
throughout 2024. Each committee has a preparatory 
and/or advisory role to the Board. The Committee 
Charters provide for the possibility of the Board to 
delegate decision-making in writing to the 
Committees on matters that fall within their 
respective tasks and responsibilities. For a more 
detailed description of the governance concerning the committees, please refer to the respective 
Committee Charters on our website.

Chairman & Vice-Chairman
The Board appointed Rudolf Ferscha as Chairman 
and Jan van Kuijk as Vice-Chairman. The Chairman 
acts as the main contact for the Directors regarding 
the functioning of the Board. The Chairman is 
primarily responsible for the functioning of the Board 
and its committees and is responsible for ensuring 
the proper conduct of business at meetings of the 
Board in order to promote a meaningful discussion 
at meetings. As a general rule, the Chairman presides 
over the General Meeting. The Vice-Chairman 
deputizes for the Chairman and is the main contact 
on behalf of the Board regarding the Chairman's 
performance.Conflicts of interest
In case of a conflict of interest, the Board will 
determine, on a simple majority vote, if a Director's 
interest indeed conflicts with the interests of the 
Company or its business in such a way as described 
in section 24.6 of the Bye-Laws. In 2024, there have 
been no cases of conflicts of interest or transactions 
between the Company and members of the Board. 
There has been one transaction with a shareholder 
holding at least 10% of the shares of the Company. 
For more information, refer to note 34 related parties 
in the consolidated financial statements.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors 
Best practice in terms of corporate governance 
prescribes that at most one of the Non-Ex ecutive 
Directors on the Board qualifies as non-independent 
and that the total number of non-independent Non-
Executive Directors should a ccount for less than half 
of the total number of Non-Executive Directors. Jan 
van Kuijk, as a co-founder of the Company, was 
attracted to his role as Non-Executive Director 
because of his specific business-related expertise. He 
did not qualify as independent under the provisions 
of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code as he is a 
former member of the Management Board of the 
Company, and because he represents a shareholder 
of the Company owning an interest of over 10%. As 
such, the number of non-independent Non-
Executive Directors on the Board amounts to one.
Despite the fact that Jan van Kuijk did not qualify as 
an independent Non-Executive Director as set out 
above, more than half of all Non-Executive Directors 
are independent.
