▪other financial liabilities measured at amortized costs (Other liabilities and 
loans and borrowings on the Consolidated statement of financial position).
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading are those assets and liabilities that 
the Group acquires or incurs principally for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term, or holds as part of a portfolio that is managed 
together for short-term profit.
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading are initially recognized and 
subsequently measured at fair value in the Consolidated statement of financial 
position, with transaction costs recognized in profit or loss. All changes in fair 
value, along with any interest and dividend income or expense, are recognized as 
part of net trading income in profit or loss. Financial assets and liabilities held for 
trading are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition.
Trading receivables and payables
Such assets and liabilities are recognized initially at fair value minus/plus any 
directly attributable transaction costs.  Subsequently, these assets and liabilities 
are measured at amortized cost.
Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)
Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
non-derivative debt and equity investments that the Group considers long-term 
strategic investments. Investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are 
recognized in other comprehensive income as part of the change in fair value at 
the next remeasurement. They are never reclassified into profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair 
value reserve in equity. When an investment is derecognized, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is not reclassified to profit or loss.
Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)
Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss includes both 
derivative and non-derivative debt and equity investments that the Group holds 
for long term trading purposes. Investments measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized 
in the profit or loss as part of the change in fair value, any re-measurement of the 
investments is classified to other income in the statement of profit or loss .
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein, are recognized in profit or loss. When an investment is derecognized, the 
gain or loss is classified to other income in the statement profit or loss.
Other financial assets and liabilities
Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are recognized initially at fair value 
less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method (EIR). The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Group 
derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or expired.
Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange 
risk associated with its capital contributions to the United States and Singapore 
subsidiaries. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge are recognized as OCI while any gains or losses relating to 
the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. On 
disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or 
losses recorded in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis when a legal right of 
offset is agreed between the parties and the Group intends either to settle on a 
net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under 
IFRS Accounting Standards, for gains and losses arising from a group of similar 
transactions such as in the Group’s trading activities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants at 
the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous
