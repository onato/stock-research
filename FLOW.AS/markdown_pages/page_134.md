Liquidity and capital resources
Besides equity, the principal source of funds has been liquidity provided by the 
prime brokers through uncommitted credit lines and margin financing, as well 
as cash generated from our operating activities. As of 31 December 2024, the 
Group held €8.4 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to €5.7 million 
as of 31 December 2023. These balances are maintained primarily to support 
operating activities, including ensuring that the Group has sufficient short-term 
access to liquidity, and capital expenditures.
The Group maintains a highly liquid Consolidated statement of financial position, 
with a large portion of its total assets consisting of cash, highly liquid marketable 
securities and short-term trading receivables (arising from securities 
transactions).
The Group actively manages its liquidity on an intraday basis and maintains 
significant portfolio financing facilities with the prime brokers in order to 
facilitate trading. These facilities are secured by cash and cash equivalents, as 
well as all financial assets in accounts held at the respective prime brokers.
