For other components, we performed analytical procedures to corroborate that 
our risk assessment and scoping remained appropriate throughout the audit. 
We held meetings with local management and component teams and visited the 
component team for Flow Traders Hong Kong entities, observed the component 
operations, discussed the group risk assessment and the risks of material 
misstatements for the Flow Traders Singapore, Hong Kong and US operating 
entities. We reviewed and evaluated the adequacy of the deliverables from 
component auditors and reviewed key working papers for these components to 
address the risks of material misstatement. We held planning meetings, key 
meetings required based on circumstances and we attended closing meetings 
with component teams for the above-mentioned components. During these 
meetings and calls, amongst others, the planning, procedures performed based 
on risk assessments, findings and observations were discussed and any further 
work deemed necessary by the primary or component team was then performed.
By performing the audit work mentioned above at the entities or business units 
within the group, together with additional work at group level, we have been able 
to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial 
information to provide an opinion on the financial statements.
Teaming and use of specialists
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included 
the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed 
client in the business of providing liquidity to financial markets. We included 
specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, derivatives and investments valuation, 
tax and transfer pricing, and have made use of our own experts in the area of 
auditing digital assets and certain disclosures that include capital requirements.
Our focus on climate-related risks 
Climate change and the energy transition are high on the public agenda and lead 
to significant change for many businesses and society. 
The board summarized Flow Traders’ ESG (environmental, social and governance) 
focus areas and reported in the section Sustainability information of the board 
report how the company is addressing climate-related and environmental risks 
also taking into account related regulatory and supervisory guidance and 
recommendations. As part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which 
climate-related risks and Flow Traders’ commitments and (constructive) 
obligations, are taken into account in estimates and significant assumptions as 
well as in the design of relevant internal control measures. Furthermore, we read 
the board report and considered whether there is any material inconsistency 
between the non-financial information in the annual report and the financial 
statements.
Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks 
to have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments, estimates or 
significant assumptions as at 31 December 2024.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we 
cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is 
our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, 
taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial 
statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the 
company and its environment and the components of the system of internal 
control, including the risk assessment process and the board’s process for 
responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and 
how the Risk Committee exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to 
Section Our risk management of the board report for the board’s (fraud) risk 
assessment.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control 
and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, the 
global whistleblower policy and incident registration. We evaluated the design 
and the implementation of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. As 
part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with 
respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and 
corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated
