General meeting, shares and 
shareholders 
It is of great importance to the Company and the 
Board that our shareholders voice their views and 
actively participate in decision-making during the 
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM). We 
pride ourselves on encouraging an open dialogue 
and ensuring that the General Meeting is adequately 
provided with information required to actively 
participate. 
In accordance with our Bye-laws and subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, the Company's 
Board shall convene, and the Company shall hold 
General Meetings as AGMs no later than six months 
after the end of the financial year. The Board may, 
whenever it deems necessary, and shall, when 
requisitioned by shareholders pursuant to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, convene General 
Meetings other than AGMs which shall be called 
Special General Meetings, at such time and place as 
the Board may appoint.
Subject to the Companies Act, a resolution may only 
be moved and put to a vote at a General Meeting if (i) 
it is proposed by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) it 
is proposed at the direction of a competent court, (iii) 
it is proposed on the requisition in writing by eligible 
shareholders, and (iv) the Chairman of the meeting in 
their absolute discretion decides that the resolution 
may properly be regarded as within scope of the 
meeting.
Save as otherwise provided in our Bye-Laws, at least 
two shareholders present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote on the matter representing the 
holders of at least 20%, or the highest amount 
required from time-to-time by any stock-exchange 
on which any of the shares are listed, of the issued share entitled to vote on the matter at such meeting 
shall be a quorum. Increased quorum requirements 
apply for the passing of certain resolutions 
requisitioned by shareholders or the resolution to 
elect, suspend or remove a Director.
Each shareholder present in person at a General 
Meeting shall be entitled to vote on any question to 
be decided on a show of hands or by a count of votes 
received in the form of electronic record (including 
by proxy), and each shareholder present in person or 
by proxy shall be entitled on a poll to vote for each 
share held by them. Each share carries one vote at a 
General Meeting. The AGM is the ideal opportunity 
for shareholders and the Board to interact. At an 
AGM, shareholders can ask questions directly. 
The 2024 AGM was held on 13 June 2024. During this 
AGM, all proposals on the agenda were adopted. The 
proposals adopted by the General Meeting related to 
the declaration of the final dividend, the 
Remuneration report, the re-election of Jan van 
Kuijk, the election of Owain Lloyd, the authority to 
issue shares, the authority to exclude or limit 
preemptive rights, the authority to purchase own 
shares and the re-appointment of the external 
auditor.
The Company's next AGM is scheduled to be held on 
13 June 2025 . More information will become available 
on our website in due course.
Alteration of the Bye-Laws
The Bye-Laws may be revoked or amended only by 
the Board, which may from time-to-time revoke or 
amend them in any way by a resolution of the Board 
passed by a majority of the Directors then in office 
and eligible to vote on that resolution, but no such 
revocation or amendment shall be operative unless 
and until it is approved at a subsequent general meeting of the Company by the Shareholders by 
Resolution passed by a majority of votes cast.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Bye-Laws, the 
Company may only allot or issue shares, or grant 
rights to subscribe for shares (other than treasury 
shares) as authorized by a shareholders’ resolution 
and within the limits of such authorization, which 
authorization cannot be withdrawn, unless 
determined otherwise at the time of the adoption of 
the resolution. 
During the 2024 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Board to issue common shares or to 
grant rights to subscribe for common shares up to 
and including 13 December 2025 for up to 10% of the 
total number of shares issued at the time of the 
General Meeting for any purposes. Any issuance 
exceeding this limit needs separate approval by the 
General Meeting.
In addition, the General Meeting renewed the 
authority of the Board to exclude or limit applicable 
preemptive rights when issuing common shares or 
granting rights to subscribe for common shares up 
to and including 13 December 2025.
At our 2025 AGM, the Board intends to request that 
the General Meeting renews its authorization to issue 
common shares or to grant rights to subscribe for 
common shares for up to 10% of the total number of 
shares issued at the time of the 2025 AGM for any 
purposes.
Purchase and cancellation of shares
The Board may, after prior authorization by 
shareholders’ resolution and within the limits of such 
authorization, authorize the purchase by the 
Company of its own shares upon such terms as the 
Board may in its discretion determine, provided
