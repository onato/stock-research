FLOW TRADERS  | ANNUAL REPORT 2024        39The Company relies on estimates and assumption in the consolidated reported numbers above. They are derived from various sources, and the methods for processing data vary across our operating subsidiaries and departments. This creates a degree 
of uncertainty due to limitations in measuring and estimating data. We are continuously working to improve our sustainability data control environment and collection processes. See chapter About Sustainability information. 
* The emissions for Scope 2 reported for 2023, amounted 966 tCO2e, were originally reported under the location-based method. This figure has now been corrected to market-based emissions. The total Scope 1 reported for 2023 remains unchanged, 
amounted to 233 tCO2e. The total market-based emissions equals 1,200tCO2e.
