Market risk
The market risk for the Group relates to the risk of the value of a financial 
instrument fluctuating because of changes in factors including, but not limited 
to, interest rates, volatilities, currency exchange rates, future dividend 
expectations and equity prices. The Risk department monitors market risk 
exposure on a continuous intraday basis. Based on the limits set per product or 
the aggregated risk for the Group, limit breaches will trigger action from the Risk 
department in order to reduce the risk back to within our preset limits.
In addition to the Group’s Risk department, the trading positions are also 
monitored daily by Operations. The applicable haircut and margins are 
computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The Risk department computes the 
haircut using internal models enabling intraday monitoring. Limits are set on 
both capital and credit usage. Long and short trading positions include securities 
and derivatives such as: shares, American Depository Receipts (ADR’s), options, 
warrants, futures, forward rate agreements (FRA’s), exchange-traded products 
(ETP) and digital assets. All traded financial instruments are liquid instruments. 
Therefore, our portfolio can always be liquidated within a short time frame and 
with a limited cost impact.
The Group seeks to hedge its trading positions to minimize its risk for adverse 
price movements and does not engage in long or short only positions. The 
direction of market movements, i.e. what the Group considers directional market 
risk taking, is not relevant for the Group because of our market-making trading 
strategy. Due to the manner in which the Group hedges foreign currency, 
interest rate risk and other price risk, the directional market risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
The overall market risk (including interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency 
risk and settlement risk) of the financial assets and liabilities held for trading are 
captured in the risk and margin requirements which the Group is required to 
post at its prime brokers and clearing firms. Although the positions are fully 
hedged, a minimum risk close to zero remains as a result of inefficiencies in the 
models of the prime brokers.
Market risk factors relating to digital assets and liabilities
In a similar matter to traditional assets, the price of a digital asset or liability 
fluctuates according to its supply and demand. We manage this risk by holding 
digital assets in the same proportion as liabilities (long/short delta neutral book).Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising from trading positions 
denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the 
Group entities, primarily the Euro, as well as United States dollars and Singapore 
dollars.
Foreign currency risk also arises on net investments in foreign operations, as well 
as net results of these foreign operations during the year. The Group manages 
foreign currency risk through daily monitoring of the positions by currency. 
Generally, the Group seeks to hedge foreign currency exposures in currencies 
other than the functional currency. The Group does use financial instruments to 
hedge the translation risk related to net investments in foreign operations or net 
results of foreign operations. Due to the manner in which the Group hedges 
foreign currency risk, the directional foreign currency risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
Interest rate risk
Interest rates will affect future profitability of the fair value of financial 
instruments. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of mismatches 
of arranged interest rates of assets and liabilities. The Group has limits in place on 
interest rate gaps for stipulated periods. These limits ensure that interest rate 
risks are hedged. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies 
are used to ensure positions are maintained within established limits. All 
financial instruments are held for trading purposes and are accounted for at fair 
value on the Consolidated statement of financial position. Positions carried on 
the Consolidated statement of financial position are short term and listed on 
exchanges and therefore liquid and tradable.
As mentioned in the paragraph trading payables, the Group has a credit facility 
available to facilitate the trading positions accounted for on the Consolidated 
statement of financial position. In order to match the liquidity and short holding 
period of these trading positions, the facility has an interest rate payable, which is 
floating. The Group runs a limited risk on the floating interest due to the fact that 
the interest is also embedded in the funding and financing of the long/short 
positions and in the ETP of the future. Due to the manner in which the Group 
hedges interest rate risk, the directional interest rate risk is close to zero. 
Therefore, no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
