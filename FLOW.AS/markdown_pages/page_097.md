market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability 
reflects its non-performance risk.
The Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an 
active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions 
for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to 
provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition 
is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or 
received. If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs 
from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted 
price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a 
valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the 
financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the 
difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price. 
Subsequently, that difference is recognized in profit or loss on an appropriate 
basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is 
wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.
The Group prices its daily trading positions based on estimated prices whereby 
the price differences are recorded through the profit or loss account. Those 
estimated prices can differ from quoted market prices. The Group’s risk and mid-
office department monitors whether all differences can be substantiated.
Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are managed by the 
Group on the basis of the net exposure to either their market or credit risk are 
measured on the basis of a price that would be received to sell a net long 
position or paid to transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure. 
Those portfolio-level adjustments are allocated to the individual assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the relative risk exposure of each of the individual 
instruments in the portfolio.
The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of 
the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
e)Other assets held for trading
Other assets held for trading comprise the amount of digital assets that the 
Group holds as a broker-trader. The Group applies IAS 2 for its digital assets and these are measured at fair value less cost to sell with changes in value 
recognized in profit or loss. 
For the determination of the fair value, the Group collects reference price points 
on an on-going basis from multiple crypto exchanges and other active markets. 
If assets are not actively traded the valuation is based upon quoted prices or 
observable inputs from similar assets.
f)Property and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When parts of an item 
of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment (calculated as 
the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount 
of the item) is recognized in Other income or expense in profit or loss. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
Ongoing repairs and maintenance costs are expensed once incurred.
Items of property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in 
profit or loss over the estimated useful lives of each component. 
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant 
items of property and equipment are as follows:
▪hardware: 5 years;
▪office fixtures: 5 years;
▪other: 5 years.
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the 
lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets
