Board composition
Changes throughout 2024 
The sole change to the composition of the Board
during the financial year 2024 was the election of
Owain Lloyd as CTO and Executive Director
per 13 June 2024.
Rotation Schedule
Any changes in the composition of the Board require 
careful consideration from a succession planning 
perspective. In making nominations to the General 
Meeting of Shareholders for the election of directors 
to the Board, the Board tries to mitigate the potential 
future risk of directors simultaneously retiring. The 
Board rotation schedule, which gives a clear insight 
into each director's term(s) is available our website.
Gender diversity within the Board 
We aim to incorporate diversity aspects such as 
nationality, age, gender, educational background or 
professional background into decision making 
concerning the composition of our workforce. 
Regardless of rules and regulations, we see diversity 
as a means to guarantee a safe and inclusive 
environment for our employees and to optimize 
balanced decision making. To the extent possible, 
these aims also apply to the composition of our 
Board. The current composition of the Board is 
diverse in terms of gender, nationality and expertise, 
and has a suitable level of experience in the financial, 
economic, trading, technology, social and legal 
aspects of a Company like ours. Specifically with 
respect to gender diversity within the Board, we have 
set the following goals: (i) to have at least 1/3 female 
and 1/3 male Non-Executive Directors and (ii) at least 
one female and at least one male Executive Director. 
During the year 2024 we were able to continue 
meeting our gender diversity goals, as is reflected in 
the following table. Board skills and expertise matrix
