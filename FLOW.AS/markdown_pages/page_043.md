Sustainable employment
As society evolves, so does our Company. Over the 
past two decades we have grown into a global 
trading firm with an entrepreneurial spirit. We strive 
to continuously understand and address the needs of 
our team, always focusing on enhancing our culture 
and making Flow Traders the best place to work.
We are committed to fostering an international, 
diverse, and empowering environment centered on 
teamwork, collaboration, and talent development. To 
sustain our business success, it is essential that our 
employees take pride in being part of our Company 
and feel connected to our goals. Every individual 
plays a vital role, and our leadership is dedicated to 
providing clear direction and recognizing top talent.
How we can contribute - our people strategy
The competition for talent in the labor market is 
intense, especially for the individuals we want to 
attract and retain. Therefore, keeping our best talent 
on board is critical. The need to foster engagement 
across our employee base and ensure a diverse and 
inclusive work environment has become more 
important. We prioritize retention while at the same 
time focus on attracting new talent. This is how we 
deliver on our ‘People’ mission; ‘Empower the best to 
become even better’.
Our vision for sustainable employment reflects our 
long-term commitment to our people. We want our 
workforce to deliver added value to our Company, 
while also experiencing personal growth and 
fulfillment.
Our approach to realizing this long-term ambition is 
captured in our people strategy. Our Human Resources and Recruitment (HRR) team focus on 
three pillars:
▪Attraction of new talent
▪Retention of the best talent 
▪Culture that unifies our ambitions
We want to offer our workforce the best possible 
employee experience, and empower them to thrive 
and feel truly valued. Employee experience is rarely a 
straight line, as individuals are at different stages in 
their journeys and have varying needs. We offer 
multiple career paths and provide a range of tools to 
support our employees in navigating their careers.Recruitment 
In the demanding and regulated financial market, 
where technology is key, our selection process is 
rigorous. Our recruitment approach, particularly for 
trading roles, is focused on graduates, as we believe  
in cultivating talent from the ground up. We view  
recruitment as a dynamic, ongoing process that we  
continuously refine, enabling us to quickly adapt to  
evolving business demands and the needs of our  
people. We actively participate in:
▪Campus visits
▪University career fairs and workshops
▪In-House Business Courses for students to 
experience trad ing
