and OCI of equity-accounted investments, until the date on which significant 
influence or joint control ceases.  
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the 
date control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the 
acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain 
purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are 
expensed as incurred, except if they are related to the issue of debt or equity 
securities. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Any gain or loss resulting from the fair value remeasurement of contingent 
consideration is recognized in profit or loss.
b)Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of 
the respective entities of the Group at exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date, with the 
foreign currency difference being recognized in profit or loss. Differences arising 
on the translation of investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income unless 
the instrument is impaired.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items in a foreign currency that are measured based on historical cost are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at 
the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated to euros at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, 
and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) of 
equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant 
influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve 
related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain 
or loss on disposal.
c)Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with 
maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Group in 
the management of its short-term commitments.
d)Financial assets and liabilities
Recognition
The Group initially recognizes loans and advances on the date on which they are 
originated. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and 
sales of financial assets) are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on 
which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or 
minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
