The criteria of this metric was changed from 
Normalized EBITDA margin to EBITDA margin 
during the 2024 performance year. 
3. Return on average shareholders' equity
The return on average shareholders' equity shows 
how much money is returned to our shareholders as 
a percentage of the money that has been invested or 
retained in Flow Traders. It is calculated by dividing 
Flow Traders net profit for the year by the average 
total shareholders' equity for the year (i.e., the 
average of the opening and closing shareholders' 
equity balances, expressed as a percentage). 
The target for this metric was set at 20% for 2024, 
which is an approximation of Flow Traders’ cost of 
equity and steers towards delivering a return on 
shareholders' equity that is greater than the 
Company’s cost of equity. Flow Traders achieved an 
actual result of 24%. 
4. Business development 
It is an ongoing goal of the Company to further grow 
and diversify our trading activities each year, 
particularly in the context of the broader market 
volumes. We revised the business development KPI 
in the previous year to more closely align with the 
Company’s stated growth and diversification agenda,  
with four components contributing to this KPI. An 
important component of our trading is off-exchange 
with institutional counterparties and the value 
traded per active counterparty helps to measure the 
development in this area. As we diversify our trading 
into different asset classes, the net trading income 
we derive from fixed income, commodities, FX and 
digital assets as a portion of total net trading income 
measures the growing diversification of the business. 
In a similar vein, the net trading income we derive 
from the Americas and APAC as a portion of total net 
trading income measures the growth of the business outside of our European market. And lastly, our own 
ETP value traded compared to the market ETP value 
traded measures our share of the overall market. 
This business development score provides a relative 
score based on an algorithm comprised of several 
input levers including the number of active 
counterparties, off-exchange value traded, our net 
trading income by asset class and by region, our own 
ETP value traded and total market ETP value traded. 
At the end of 2024, Flow Traders had over 2,000 
counterparties and off-exchange value traded 
amounted to €518 billion for the year. Fixed income, 
commodities, FX and digital assets accounted for 51% 
of total NTI and the Americas and APAC accounted 
for 44% of total NTI. Flow Traders ETP value traded 
amounted to €1,545 billion and market ETP value 
traded amounted to €47,933 billion.
The target for this metric was set at 1.8 for 2024, given 
these inputs and developments, Flow Traders 
achieved a actual score of 1.72.
5. Compliance awareness score  
The compliance awareness score ensures that the 
incidents raised as part of the Financial & Capital Risk 
and Non-Financial Risk & Compliance Committees 
are reported on a timely basis to the Board. Only 
known incidents are raised to the Board at the time 
of reporting. 
Incident management was successful overall; issues 
were identified and escalated through transparent 
channels. Opportunities remain for improvement 
with respect to implementing cross-departmental 
enhancements and structural solutions rather than 
ad hoc improvements.
Flow Traders achieved a 100% outcome with respect 
to its compliance awareness score which is in line with the 2024 target set for the executives. All 
incidents were reported on a timely basis and Flow 
Traders relies on the procedures and training of the 
Compliance and Business teams to ensure any 
breach of obligations are sufficiently escalated and 
acted upon.
6. Engagement score 
This is the average score given by our employees in 
response to the main engagement question in our 
annual global employee engagement survey. 
Engagement is a measure of how committed and 
enthusiastic employees are about their work and the 
organization. When people are engaged, they feel 
more comfortable being themselves at work. 
Different factors contribute to employee 
engagement, including organizational culture, work 
environment, work relationships, and development 
opportunities.
On the engagement score a 7.2 (2023: 7.0) was 
scored, this is 6% below the global target of 7.7 for 
2024. However, the regional scores (EMEA: 7.1, 
Americas: 7.4, APAC: 7.0) were all in line with the 
regional benchmarks.
2024 performance summary
The performance on the Company scorecard in 
combination with the Executive Directors’ individual 
performance have determined the individual variable 
compensation outcome. As mentioned, our KPIs do 
not have further pre-determined weightings, 
allowing the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee to determine the overall outcome and 
ensure appropriateness in overall circumstances. 
While the results of the engagement score and 
business development measures came in below 
target, performance on these metrics was still viewed 
as acceptable, given the market circumstances. The 
rationale for not reaching the targets has been
