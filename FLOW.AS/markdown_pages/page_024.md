Enterprise risk management (ERM)
We aim for a good balance between our business 
activities, return on capital and related risks taken. 
Flow Traders’ ERM approach ensures that our risk 
appetite and profile are integrated into our day-to-
day operations and strategic decision-making. 
Annually, the Board determines the strategic goals 
and subsequent business targets. Based on these 
targets, the Company formulates its risk appetite. 
These targets and risk appetite parameters provide 
direction to our various departments and are used to 
determine our strategic risks. 
Policies and control standards are maintained, 
developed and updated within the ERMF. The 
policies are based on our risk taxonomy and aligned 
with our control setting. To ensure that our daily 
activities remain in line with our risk appetite and 
residual risk we perform yearly Risk Control Self-
Assessments (RCSA) to evaluate current risks and 
identify new risks. We also conduct an annual Risk 
Management Control Cycle to define and test our 
key controls that mitigate our critical, high and 
medium inherent risks in all of our business 
processes to accepted residual risk levels.Risk categories
Our risk taxonomy is split into five broad risk 
categories - Financial, Business and strategic, 
Compliance and ethical, Operational, and 
Technology - each with their own specific sub-risks:

categoryDescription of the risk
Financial riskCapital riskCapital risk (cost of doing business) refers to the situation where potential 
loss of investment value happens due to factors such as market volatility, 
regulatory and prime broker requirements, economic downturns, or poor 
financial performance of a company. It is the risk of failing to meet 
compulsory capital requirements invested in an asset or investment which 
are needed to maintain a firm’s trading licenses and normal business 
activities and relationships with prime brokers.
Liquidity riskLiquidity risk refers to the inability to replenish capital to the required level. 
This can happen when: 1) not being able to obtain additional funding in a 
timely manner at a reasonable cost and 2) an inefficient internal 
management on liquidity. This is the risk of not being able to quickly 
convert an investment into cash without experiencing a significant loss in 
value, due to a lack of buyers or sellers in the market, restrictions on 
trading, or the illiquid nature of the asset itself that leads to an inability to 
easily buy or sell an asset without incurring significant costs. It can also 
happen because of a lack of access to alternative sources of funding such 
as short-term loans, trading credit from certain platforms, etc. in a timely 
manner. This is the risk of internal management deficiency which can lead 
to liquidity constraints.
Market riskMarket risk is the risk to an institution resulting from movements in market 
prices; in particular, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and 
equity, cryptocurrency and commodity prices.
Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing institution involved in 
trading in or issuing a financial instrument defaulting on an obligation.
