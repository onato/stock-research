Our operations
Our headquarter in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is home to our technology, corporate functions and our Board. Flow Traders provides liquidity on-exchange as a 
registered market maker and off-exchange in bilateral trades with institutional counterparties. Operating from Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Singapore, New York, and several 
branch offices we ensure global coverage. By continuously quoting bid-ask prices we support investors to buy and sell assets at prices reflecting current market values.
