Double Materiality Assessment (DMA)
The DMA serves as the foundation for prioritizing the 
sustainability matters most relevant to us and our 
stakeholders.
Our stakeholders include individuals and groups 
affected by our activities, those with a (in)direct 
interest in our operations and value chain, 
comprising of our end-to-end operational partners 
such as exchanges, counterparties, prime brokers 
etc, and those who influence our long and short term 
success.
Materiality framework five step approachHow we identify our material topics
Our materiality framework consists of five steps to 
assess the effect of our business on the environment 
and society, as well as the reverse. The DMA 
concludes the following: (1) Flow Traders’ most 
material impacts are related to our people and 
environment, and (2) the key sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities stem from our own 
operations and stakeholders with in our value chain . Stakeholder engagement
We are committed to ongoing stakeholder 
engagements which includes ESG strategic theme 
owners, business experts, and the ESG team. Our 
Stakeholder Engagement Policy outlines our key  
principles for engagement.
Our engagement efforts span dialogues with 
investors, financial market associations, and partners 
across our value chain, as well as ESG-related 
questionnaires received from these stakeholders. 
These engagements have provided insights into the 
evolving classification and standardization of data for 
sustainable investment products, including the 
Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) 
and EU Taxonomy legislation. Additionally, they have 
highlighted the growing financial impact of cyber 
security risks, particularly in the context of 
compliance with the Digital Operational Resilience 
Act (DORA) and the rising frequency of external 
cyber threats.
