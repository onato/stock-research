(a) Gross trading income for each region was restated to reflect the results 
achieved by regions trading as principal.
(b) The inter-segment revenue and expenses related to trading services, 
represents inter-segmental transactions from trading income earned by regions 
trading in agency capacity from other regions, with a corresponding inter-
segmental expense. Intra-region revenue and expenses are presented on a net 
basis. EMEA’s 2023 intra-region revenue related to trading activities has been 
restated as it was previously presented gross. These lines have previously been 
disclosed in NTI. 
(c) The inter-segment revenue and expenses related to other intercompany 
transactions, represents an accumulation of all intercompany transactions not 
already covered under note (a), resulting in inter-segmental revenues and 
corresponding expenses. Intra-region revenue and expenses are presented on a 
net basis. This line was previously entitled ‘Intercompany recharge’.
(d) Assets for each region have been previously presented net of financial 
liabilities held for trading, Trading payables and Other liabilities held for trading. 
Liabilities for each region have previously not included Financial liabilities held 
for trading, Trading payables and Other liabilities held for trading. Besides this, 
the balance has been restated for the incorrect presentation of FX forwards, 
please refer to note 4, for the this restatement.
8.Fair value measurement
Valuation models 
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement 
that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer 
the liability in an orderly transaction between independent market participants 
at the measurement date. 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, 
depending on the inputs used for making the measurements.▪Level 1: fair value of financial instruments based upon inputs that are quoted, 
unadjusted, market prices in active markets for identical instruments;
▪Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in 
active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are not considered active; or other valuation 
techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable 
from market data;
▪Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments 
for which the valuation technique includes unobservable inputs that have a 
significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes 
instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments 
but for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are 
required to reflect differences between the instruments, for example unlisted 
equity securities.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active 
markets are based on prices obtained directly from an exchange on which the 
instruments are traded or obtained from a broker that provides an unadjusted 
quoted price from an active market for identical instruments. For all other 
financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation 
techniques.
When the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on 
the basis of net exposures to market risks, it applies judgment in determining 
appropriate portfolio-level adjustments such as bid-ask spreads. Such 
adjustments are derived from observable bid-ask spreads for similar instruments 
and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio. 
Similarly, when the Group measures portfolios of financial assets and financial 
liabilities on the basis of net exposure to the credit risk of a particular 
counterparty, it takes into account any existing arrangements that mitigate the 
credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty).
