Markets and trends 
ETP investing
In recent years, the ETP ecosystem has continued to 
mature and experienced significant growth in both 
AuM and number of products. According to ETFGI, 
global ETP AuM increased from $11,634 billion at the 
end of 2023 to $14,846 billion at the end of 2024. This 
is a reflection of the underlying market performance 
during 2024 coupled with record inflows into ETPs. 
The market expectation is that AuM will continue to 
grow going forward and we believe there are several 
reasons for this. One is that investors are attracted to 
the transparent nature of ETPs, which enables them 
to clearly follow how the underlying securities are 
performing. Another reason is that ETPs are liquid, 
available at lower costs and can be bought and sold 
easily during market hours. A third reason is that 
ETPs can be composed of financial instruments from 
almost any asset class, sector or location, providing 
investors with access to markets that would normally 
be difficult to reach. 
Global ETP markets grew by 28% in 2024, as 
measured by AuM, driven predominantly by the out 
performance of the underlying markets. Annual 
global inflows of ETP AuM were $1.88 trillion in 2024 
(2023: $985 billion – source ETFGI). Overall trading 
activity in 2024 increased compared to the prior year 
given surprising monetary policy changes by central 
banks around the world, political elections in major 
economies that were expected to have significant 
impact on macroeconomic policies, and the 
resurgence of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. 
Global coverage  
In 2024, Flow Traders’ ETP value traded once again 
was in excess of the €1 trillion mark. The European 
ETP market recorded total ETP value traded of €2,518 
billion in 2024, compared to €2,039 billion in 2023. 
Flow Traders' total ETP value traded in Europe was €655 billion in 2024, compared to €619 billion in 2023. 
We remained a leading liquidity provider in ETPs and 
managed to grow our on- and off-exchange trading 
capabilities further. 
The largest ETP market globally remains in the 
Americas, where total ETP value traded (on- and off-
exchange) was €38,545 billion in 2024, compared to 
€35,874 billion in 2023. Flow Traders' ETP value 
traded in the Americas was €776 billion in 2024, 
compared to €754 billion in 2023. Institutional 
trading continued to expand as well and Flow 
Traders Americas continued to grow and deepen its 
overall presence in this important market. We also 
expanded our lead market maker activities during 
2024 and supported numerous ETF listings in the 
U.S. for a variety of leading issuers, including the spot 
Bitcoin ETF launches in the U.S. 
In APAC, the ETP market remained fragmented, with 
large differences in trading volumes, trading costs, 
regulation and maturity across the financial markets. 
The Asian ETP market recorded total ETP value 
traded of €6,871 billion in 2024, including China, 
compared to €5,168 billion in 2023. Flow Traders' total 
ETP value traded in Asia was €114 billion in 2024, 
compared to €93 billion in 2023. Flow Traders had its 
most successful year ever in Asia in 2024, a clear 
validation of our strategy to invest in the region. 
Our business - operations 
We operate three main trading hubs in Amsterdam, 
Hong Kong, and New York. In addition, we operate 
branch offices in Chicago, Cluj, London, Milan, Paris, 
Shanghai, and Singapore. 
In 2024 we had access to +180 exchanges and 
trading venues, globally. We provided liquidity in 
over 6,500 unique ETP ISINs on- and off-exchange, 
which is more than 40% of all ETPs globally. Off-exchange, we provided liquidity in ETPs on a RFQ 
basis to more than 2,000 institutional counterparties 
across the globe, including banks, asset managers, 
pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, 
hedge funds, and others, and this number is 
increasing on an almost daily basis. In addition to 
ETPs we provide liquidity in similar instruments 
whose value is correspondingly affected by a change 
in the value of underlying or related assets, such as 
futures or bonds. During 2024, we continued to 
implement our diversification, strategy and related 
initiatives across other asset classes and provided 
liquidity as a market maker in FX, fixed income, 
commodities and digital assets. 
Irrespective of what we trade, as a liquidity provider 
we generally do not have a directional opinion on the 
market. In other words, our results do not depend on 
the direction of market prices. Our net trading 
income is derived from the small price differences 
that are realized between buying and selling related 
or correlated assets. Whether that is between the 
ETPs we buy or sell, the prices we pay or receive for 
the underlying related financial instruments to 
mitigate our risk, or trading FX pairs.
We are not a bank, broker or investment manager 
and do not have client AuM as we trade from our 
own capital. We also do not develop or make 
products, do not provide any services and do not 
have (consumer) clients. Our value chain comprises, 
among others, of our institutional counterparties, 
prime brokers and regulators.
