Scope 1: Heating 
(natural gas)Calculation based on secondary data method, by:
▪Actual natural gas consumption (in kWh) from meter 
reading
▪Multiplied by the emission factor of natural gas to 
CO2eMeter reading data is derived from energy supplier invoices. Since invoicing occurs throughout the 
month rather than on the first day, we use a prorated proxy to calculate emissions for the reporting 
period from 1 January, 2024, to 31 December, 2024. Additionally, due to the absence of invoices for two 
months, we estimate based on 366 days over the year. We use the UK government Department of 
Environment, Fuels and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) conversion factors to convert natural gas usage into CO 2.Worldwide 
Scope 1: Company 
carCalculation based on primary data method, by:
▪Distance driven in KM
▪Multiplied by average emission factor of petrol 
medium size car (unknown)The distance driven is determined using meter reading data from the fleet manager's application. Since 
readings are taken intermittently throughout the reporting year, we use the most recent readings 
available closest to the reporting period -  early December 2023 and mid-January 2025 - to calculate the 
total distance driven during the period. We estimate the total KM driven based on 366 days over the year. 
We use DEFRA conversion factors to convert the total KM driven in the car into CO 2. Worldwide 
Scope 2: Electricity 
(location-based)Calculation based on primary data method, by:
▪Amsterdam, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong, 
London, Cluj, Shanghai office: actual electricity 
consumption from meter reading (in kWh) as 
provided by the electricity supplier/landlord on the 
invoices, multiplied by country specific emission 
factor of the electricity grid
▪Paris and Milan offices: estimation based on floor size 
in m2 multiplied by average emissions per m2Meter reading data is derived from energy supplier invoices. Since invoicing occurs throughout the 
month rather than on the first day, we use a prorated proxy to calculate emissions for the reporting 
period from 1 January, 2024, to 31 December, 2024. Additionally, due to the absence of invoices for Cluj 
five-months, London three months, Chicago one month and New York three to five  months, we 
estimate the annual total based on 366 days over the year. We use DEFRA conversion factors to convert 
natural gas usage into CO 2.Worldwide
Scope 2: Electricity 
(market-based)Calculation based on primary data method, by:
▪Total scope 2 Electricity Location-based
▪The total location-based emissions from all reported 
offices minus the total location based emissions from 
Amsterdam and London as these 2 locations' 
electricity are from renewable energy sources 
▪Milan, Paris and Shanghai is calculated using average 
square meters for each office For the share of renewable electricity, we rely on renewable energy certificates provided by our office 
landlords. As of year end 2024, the electricity consumption for our offices in Amsterdam and London is 
sourced from renewable energy. No actual CO2 data is available for any office location, as such location-
based data is used for the calculation to market based emissions).
Green certificates for buildings that don’t cover the reporting period cannot be relied upon in full for 
2024 from an audit perspective. Due to the timing difference between the issuance of the annual report 
and receipt of the 2024 updated green certificates result in certain buildings having to be considered 
gray as oppose to green.
For offices in Paris, Milan and Shanghai we use the square meter for each office and assume an average 
kWh per square meter. This is then converted into CO 2e using DEFRA conversion factors.Worldwide

Scope 3: Cat. 7 – 
Employee 
commutingCalculation based on primary data method, by:
▪Commuting by various modes
▪CO2 emissions per travel as provided by NS Business 
Card railway agentOur data calculation includes all Amsterdam office employees commuting registered by public transport 
using the NS business card. However, employee commuting outside these channels - car, bike, walk - is 
not included in the calculations. Flow Traders calculates the conversion using a weighted average 
conversion factor from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. Amsterdam
Scope 3: Cat. 15 - 
InvestmentsRelevant. No data available from investee’s. The majority 
of material strategic investments are in the form of 
equity and warrant investments in digital asset 
companies, from whom no data is available on 
environmental footprint.No data is available from the investee companies, and there is no comparable companies, with similar 
business activities, CO₂ footprint average to support a reasonable estimate of scope 3 emissions. Flow 
Traders will work with relevant investees to obtain this data in the future. However for now, we are 
unable to calculate the emissions.WorldwideGHG Protocol
