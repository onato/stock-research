Deferral and vesting of variable pay
We believe in creating a culture of ownership, risk awareness and entrepreneurial 
spirit and we embrace an approach which truly connects our people to the 
business in sharing profit and risk. To ensure that the variable remuneration award 
of the Executive Directors is aligned with our beliefs and contributes to long-term 
value creation and shareholder experience, 50% of the 2024 award to the 
Executive Directors is paid out in equity deferred over multiple years. This 
approach allows us to take a longer-term outlook on remuneration and the table 
below illustrates the vesting schedule for outstanding awards. All equity-based 
awards are subject to a holding period of one-year post-vesting. The main terms 
and conditions of the awarded shares to Executive Directors are provided in the 
table ‘Executive Directors share-based compensation’. The remaining 50% is 
settled in cash, paid in equal installments in 2025 and 2026. 
The above approach accords with our culture and remuneration philosophy of 
encouraging management and employee share ownership, creating alignment 
with the our long-term success.
