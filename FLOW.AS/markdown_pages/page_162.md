7.In-Kind Satisfaction. The Board may also, in 
addition to its other powers, direct payment or 
satisfaction of any dividend or distribution out of 
contributed surplus wholly or in part by the 
distribution of specific assets, and in particular of 
paid-up shares or debentures of any other 
company, and where any difficulty arises in 
regard to such distribution or dividend, the Board 
may settle it as it thinks expedient, and in 
particular, may authorize any person to sell and 
transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions 
altogether, and may fix the value for distribution 
or dividend purposes of any such specific assets 
and may determine that cash payments shall be 
made to any Shareholders upon the footing of the 
values so fixed in order to secure equality of 
distribution and may vest any such specific assets 
in trustees as may seem expedient to the Board, 
provided that such dividend or distribution may 
not be satisfied by the distribution of any partly 
paid shares or debentures of any company 
without the sanction of a Resolution.
Reserves
8.Reserves. The Board may before declaring any 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, set aside such sums as it thinks proper as 
reserves which shall, at the discretion of the 
Board, be applicable for any purpose of the 
Company and pending such application may, also 
at such discretion, either be employed in the 
business of the Company or be invested in such 
investments as the Board may from time to time 
think fit. The Board may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which it 
may think it prudent not to distribute. 
Capitalization of profits
9.Capitalization. The Board may from time to time 
resolve to capitalize all or any part of any amount 
for the time being standing to the credit of any 
reserve or fund which is available for distribution 
or to the credit of any share premium account 
and accordingly that such amount be set free for 
distribution amongst the shareholders or any 
class of shareholders who would be entitled 
thereto if distributed by way of dividend and in 
the same proportions, on the footing that the 
same be not paid in cash but be applied either in 
or towards paying up amounts for the time being 
unpaid on any shares in the Company held by 
such Shareholders respectively or in payment up 
in full of unissued shares, debentures or other 
obligations of the Company, to be allotted and 
distributed credited as fully paid amongst such 
Shareholders, or partly in one way and partly in 
the other, provided that for the purpose of this 
Bye-Law, a share premium account may be 
applied only in paying up of unissued shares to be 
issued to such Shareholders credited as fully paid.
