Business conduct and corporate culture
Business conduct and our culture is at the core of 
everything we do. We operate within a highly 
regulated market. Upholding the highest ethical 
standards and adhering to our own policies and 
procedures is central to our business conduct and 
corporate culture. We enforce a zero-tolerance policy 
for any form of undesirable behavior and have 
reporting procedures in place to address and resolve 
issues, ensuring accountability to all stakeholders. 
These reporting procedures are set out in the policies  
below. 
Policies related to governance  
Whistleblowing  Policy 
We promote a culture of openness and transparency, 
encouraging both our employees and external 
partners to speak up when they encounter any 
concerns or suspect potential abuse or violations of 
our Code of Conduct, Company Policies, values, or 
the law. Our Global Whistleblowing Policy ensures a 
safe and secure reporting and investigation process, 
with zero tolerance for retaliation or any adverse 
consequences against those who raise concerns in 
good faith or participate in investigations. If a report 
is later found to be unfounded, we are committed to 
protecting and supporting those who stand up for 
integrity. Our Global Whistleblower Policy is available 
on our website. 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy 
Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABC) Policy 
sets our commitment to and the standards for 
preventing bribery and corruption, while ensuring 
that any concerns about unlawful behavior are 
identified, reported, and investigated. This policy is 
aligned with the UN Convention against corruption.  
Every employee is responsible for upholding honesty 
and ethical conduct in all aspects of their work, as 
outlined in our ABC Policy. It is both a right and a duty to report any suspected abuse to the 
Compliance department or anonymously to the 
Trusted Person, without fear of retaliation.
Please see our Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption 
Policy on our website. Read more in section: Risk 
management - Compliance and ethical risk. 
Public Affairs Policy
As part of our broad public affairs strategy, we 
connect with stakeholders and peers to foster 
dialogue and align perspectives on emerging 
regulatory developments and societal trends 
shaping our industry. We engage in policy 
influencing to support our business objectives, 
collaborating with trade associations and a diverse 
range of stakeholders.
A cornerstone of this strategy is establishing open, 
constructive dialogues with our stakeholders, 
ensuring we respond to their views and concerns 
while balancing competing expectations. By 
addressing pressing issues and demonstrating our 
positive societal impact, we aim to continuously 
enhance our business.
Overall, 2024 was an progressive year in terms of 
political developments. Our main points of interests 
over 2024 were the discussion on the (global) 
regulatory framework for digital assets, the 
shortening of settlement cycles in the U.S.,  UK and 
Europe, and driving transparency in the markets, in 
particular in the bond market by the introduction of 
the consolidated tape in the EU and UK. 
Our contributions to industry bodies reflect our 
commitment to shaping the future of our market. 
Examples include:▪Serving on the Board of the Dutch Association of 
Proprietary Traders (APT)
▪Holding the vice-chair position of the Executive 
Committee of the European Proprietary Traders 
Association (FIA-EPTA)
▪Membership in Holland Fintech
▪Participating in the EC Consolidated Tape Expert 
Stakeholder Group and consultative work streams 
of FIA-Asia, as well as various advisory committees 
for exchanges, trading platforms, consolidated 
tape providers, data vendors and national expert 
groups
We do not make any financial or in-kind political 
contributions. Our public affairs expenditures are 
focused on membership contributions, monitoring 
and advisory fees, and (internal) operational costs 
and expenses.
We foster transparency and our contributions to the 
regulatory and legislative dialogue are typically made 
public and we are always willing to discuss our 
position and the interests we take into account. Our 
Public Affairs Policy is available on our website.
