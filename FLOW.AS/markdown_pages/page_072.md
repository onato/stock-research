Letter from the Chairwoman 2024  
Dear Stakeholders,
On behalf of the Remuneration & Appointment 
Committee, I am pleased to present our 2024 
Remuneration report. This report includes a 
summary of our Remuneration Policy currently in 
place and the remuneration paid out in 2024 in 
accordance with this policy. In relation to the 
allocated remuneration for 2024, this was aligned to 
Flow Traders’ strong financial performance, including 
a record fourth quarter in 2024 and second-best year 
in terms of financial performance in the firm’s 20-
year history. To provide context, as a result of the 
overall increase in market activity over the year, we 
recorded net trading income of € 467.8 million and 
net profit of € 159.5 million for the financial year 2024, 
which was well above our financial performance in 
the prior year. These results are aligned with the KPI 
scorecard and formed the basis for the remuneration 
distributed for the financial year 2024. The Non-
Executive Directors, in close consultation with, and 
supported by, the Executive Directors have decided 
that the 2024 firm-wide variable remuneration pool 
is €87 million (2023: €34.7 million), corresponding to 
32.5% of operating result in 2024. Competition for talent
Talented professionals, especially those with 
expertise relevant to Flow Traders, are in short 
supply. To stay ahead of the competition, we 
prioritize attracting, retaining, and developing top 
talent. That is why we have strengthened our talent 
pipeline and enhanced our remuneration 
frameworks to align with our ambitious talent goals. 
In 2024, we developed and implemented revised 
salary frameworks and increased transparency in the 
distribution of our profit-sharing scheme in an effort 
to further improve our position as an employer of 
choice. 
A stronger technology team
A key element in building strong, engaged teams is 
appointing the right leaders. In 2024, we were thrilled 
to welcome Owain Lloyd as our CTO. With his 
extensive expertise and proven track record in critical 
areas such as quantitative systems, automation, and 
scaling technology infrastructure, Owain brings the 
leadership and vision needed to drive our technology 
function forward.
His appointment marks an exciting step in our 
continued growth. Since joining the firm, Owain has 
already made a significant positive impact by 
strengthening the core Technology leadership team 
as well as improving cross-functional collaboration. 
We look forward to the continued impact he will 
make as we advance our mission and strengthen our 
capabilities. Fostering culture
The Flow Traders Board members, and specifically 
the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, 
remain committed throughout the year in 
supporting initiatives that foster engagement and 
strengthen the firm’s entrepreneurial culture.
In 2024, the Executive Directors, supported by the 
broader leadership team, developed and executed 
regional engagement plans aimed at enhancing key 
focus areas such as team collaboration, 
communication, and strategic transparency. 
Additionally, members of the Remuneration & 
Appointment Committee engaged directly with 
employees to build connections and gain valuable 
insights. These interactions enable us, as Non-
Executive Board members, to provide informed 
guidance and support to the organization, ensuring 
we continue to drive growth and innovation.
