The Board's focus  in 2024
During 2024, the Board held ten formal Board 
meetings and met several times without holding a 
formal meeting. Examples of meetings without 
holding a formal meeting include a preparation 
session for the AGM, education and strategy days 
and the self-assessment day. During these meetings 
a variety of topics were discussed, including but not 
limited to the following:
Strategy 
The Board remained focused on sustainable long-
term value creation, taking into account the 
strategy’s implementation and feasibility, the 
business model applied by the Company and the 
market in which the business operates, opportunities 
and risks for the Company and the Company’s 
operational and financial goals. They also consider 
the future impact of the Company’s position in 
relevant markets, stakeholder interests, and any 
other aspects relevant to the Company and its 
business, such as the environment, social and 
employee-related matters, the value chain within 
which the business operates and fighting corruption 
and bribery.
Strategy-associated risks 
Reviewing the Company’s risk assessment processes 
and the monitoring of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems continued to be a 
priority and joint responsibility of the Board and all 
committees throughout the year 2024. The review 
entailed an overview of all relevant risks the 
Company is exposed to, the internal controls in place 
to address these risks, and the Board’s view on such 
risks.Financial results
The Board was updated on the Company’s financial, 
legal and compliance risks through the Audit 
Committee and the Risk & Sustainability Committee. 
Other topics discussed were the annual, half-yearly 
and quarterly results. 
Off-site
The Board met for a three-day off-site meeting in the 
Flow Traders New York office. During this off-site, the 
Board concentrated on gaining insights into and 
interacting with the U.S. operations, which involved 
engaging with local leadership and essential 
ecosystem partners. The sessions held provided the 
Board with an opportunity to learn more about 
business development in the region, trading, and 
Flow Traders’ value proposition in the U.S.
Remuneration and variable compensation of 
Executive Directors and employees
The Remuneration & Appointment Committee 
updated the Board on remuneration and variable 
compensation plans for both employees and the 
Executive Directors. The Executive Directors did not 
participate in the deliberations and decision-making 
concerning their own remuneration. 
Sustainability
Through the Risk & Sustainability Committee, we 
intensified our focus on sustainability, we continue to 
monitor developments in relation to the adoption of 
the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) within Dutch legislation and the implications 
of the European Commissions’ Omnibus 
Announcement in February 2025.As part of our ESG efforts, we conducted a detailed 
DMA to assess both the financial impacts of 
sustainability risks and the environmental and social 
impacts of our operations. The findings were 
integrated into the deliberations of the Risk & 
Sustainability Committee.
The Internal Audit function (IA)
The recommendations of the IA function, the 
functioning of the IA function and the progress of the 
2024 Internal Audit Plan have been discussed and 
followed up during 2024.
Board evaluation
In November 2024, the Non-Executive Directors self-
evaluated their functioning and performance as a 
group as well as for the Board’s committees and for 
the individual Non-Executive Directors. In 
preparation, input was collected by way of an 
extensive questionnaire from the individual Non-
Executive Directors, from the Executive Directors and 
from key employees with regular access to the Board 
and/or its committees. The Non-Executive Directors 
discussed this input and reflected on the insights 
provided.
Based on the input and their own assessment of the 
skills matrix, the Non-Executive Directors concluded 
that they bring sufficient diversity in experience and 
competencies to collectively be able to ensure a 
proper and effective governance for the Company. 
Also the composition and effectiveness of the Board 
committees was positively assessed.
