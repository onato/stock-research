Investor Relations
Investor Relations (IR) focuses on optimizing the 
communication and understanding between Flow 
Traders and the investor community, its advisors and 
the analyst community. By attending broker 
conferences, organizing roadshows to institutional 
investors after Half Year and Full Year results, 
organizing investor conference calls, analyst days 
and the Annual General Meeting, Flow Traders 
further optimizes the information stream to the 
market. Flow Traders has a corporate website 
(www.flowtraders.com/investors) where, among 
other information, its financial calendar, press 
releases, presentations, reports and the dividend 
policy can be found. IR is the first point of contact for 
interested investors, shareholders and analysts.
