2024 remuneration for employees
Variable remuneration
We apply an annual performance cycle. At the 
beginning of each calendar year, clear objectives are 
set, which are in line with our Company objectives. 
Performance is reviewed twice during an annual 
cycle. Individual variable remuneration payable from 
the collective variable compensation pool is 
dependent on Company and business unit 
performance, individual performance and the 
individual’s contribution to the long-term success of 
the Company as a whole, discouraging a culture of 
‘star’ behavior and fostering collaboration and 
teamwork. Flow Traders does not base variable 
remuneration directly on financial results achieved 
individually. The Executive Directors approve the 
awarding of variable remuneration. If awarded, 
variable remuneration is paid in cash, Company 
shares and Company share like instruments in one to 
multiple annual installments, depending on the 
amount of variable remuneration awarded. The 
deferred variable component acts as a first loss 
tranche to compensate for any operating loss in the 
subsequent year, acting as a buffer before such loss 
would impact shareholder equity. This serves as an 
important incentive for risk-aware behavior, focusing 
on the long-term objectives of the Company and 
alignment with our risk appetite. We deem the 
deferral period sufficient given the Company’s risk 
profile and horizon.
▪Variable remuneration components may become 
subject to reduction or clawback if it is 
determined that the relevant employee did not 
meet adequate norms of competence and 
appropriate behavior or was responsible for 
behavior that led to a substantial deterioration of the Company’s position, in accordance with 
applicable law
▪We do not award guaranteed variable 
remuneration to employees unless the 
guaranteed variable component is awarded in 
relation to hiring new staff, limited to the first year 
of employment, and only if we have a sound and 
strong capital base
▪We do not award severance payments if there is a 
serious imputable act or negligence by the 
employee in the fulfillment of his or her function 
or where an employee resigns voluntarily (unless 
this is the consequence of a serious imputable act 
or negligence (ernstig verwijtbaar handelen of 
nalaten) by the Company)
▪The Company does not grant its employees any 
personal loans, guarantees or equivalent benefit 
as part of their compensation package. We do not 
provide any other ancillary benefits for any 
employee. We have not reserved or accrued any 
amounts to cover pension claims or retirement 
claims
Emphasizing share ownership
We value ownership, both in terms of mindset, 
behavior as well as a share in the ownership of the 
Company. We believe that being a shareholder aligns 
the interests of the Company with those of our 
employees. Ever since the Company went public and 
before, we have a history of offering our employees 
the opportunity to become shareholders. From 
performance year 2020 onwards, we have begun 
rewarding employees directly in Company shares. 
The higher the variable remuneration an individual receives, the higher the proportion of variable 
compensation paid out in shares.
We are also maintaining our FLIP (Flow Loyalty 
Incentive Plan) program, whereby we award 
Company shares to employees marking their two-
year anniversary with the Company. Shares awarded 
under the FLIP are subject to a lock-up period. All 
shares awarded to employees are fully paid out from 
the variable compensation pool. The terms and 
conditions of the employee share plans are subject to 
review by the Executive Directors annually. As a part 
of these plans, shares have been and will be bought 
in the market.
Pension
We encourage our employees to save for retirement. 
At our headquarter in Amsterdam, we partner with a 
pension provider, giving employees the freedom of 
choice to select the option that best suits their 
individual needs while incentivizing participation in 
the Company-sponsored program. In our other 
offices we offer schemes that are driven by country 
specific practices and regulations.
