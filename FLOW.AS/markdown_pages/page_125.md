Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Our Group Operational Risk framework contributes to raise awareness of these 
risks to all our employees and promotes a risk mitigation culture in all our 
processes. This includes documenting of procedures and periodically updating of 
this documentation. 
The risk governance and independence of the Risk team ensures that our risk 
appetite is appropriately implemented, monitored and reported to management 
on a regular basis. We maintain an internal operational risk event database that 
captures any incident that may have occurred (irrespective if it led to a financial 
loss/profit or not). We routinely perform an in-depth analysis of these incidents in 
order to avoid a reoccurrence.
