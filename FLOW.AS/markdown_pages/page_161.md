Provisions in the Bye-Laws governing 
the appropriation of profit
The provisions in the Bye-Laws governing the 
appropriation of profit read as follows: 
Dividends and other payments 
1.Dividends and Distributions. Subject to these Bye-
Laws, the Board may from time to time declare 
dividends or distributions out of contributed 
surplus to be paid to the Shareholders according 
to their rights and interests, including such 
interim dividends as appear to the Board to be 
justified by the position of the Company. The 
Board, in its discretion, may determine that any 
dividend shall be paid in cash or shall be satisfied, 
subject to Bye -Laws 5.2, 35.1 and 35.2, in paying 
up in full shares in the Company to be issued to 
the Shareholders credited as fully paid or partly 
paid or partly in one way and partly the other. The 
Board may also pay any fixed cash dividend which 
is payable on any shares of the Company half 
yearly or on such other dates, whenever the 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the 
Board, justifies such payment. In making any 
determination regarding the declaration of a 
dividend or distribution out of contributed 
surplus, the Board must, in addition to any other 
obligations or duties under the Companies Acts 
or these Bye-Laws, consider the Stakeholder 
Interests. 
2.Implementation. Except insofar as the rights 
attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share 
otherwise provide: (a) all dividends or distributions out of contributed surplus may be 
declared and paid according to the amounts paid 
up on the shares in respect of which the dividend 
or distribution is paid, and an amount paid up on 
a share in advance of calls may be treated for the 
purpose of this Bye-Law as paid-up on the share; 
(b) dividends or distributions out of contributed 
surplus may be apportioned and paid pro rata 
according to the amounts paid-up on the shares 
during any portion or portions of the period in 
respect of which the dividend or distribution is 
paid. 
3.Deductions. The Board may deduct from any 
dividend, distribution or other monies payable to 
a Shareholder by the Company on or in respect of 
any shares all sums of money (if any) presently 
payable by him to the Company on account of 
calls or otherwise in respect of shares of the 
Company. 
4.No Interest. No dividend, distribution or other 
monies payable by the Company on or in respect 
of any share shall bear interest against the 
Company. 
5.Method of Payment. (a) Subject to Bye-Law 
33.5(b), any dividend, distribution or interest, or 
part thereof payable in cash, or any other sum 
payable in cash to the holder of shares may be 
paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post 
or by courier addressed to the holder at their 
address in the Register or, in the case of joint 
holders, addressed to the holder whose name 
stands first in the Register in respect of the shares at their registered address as appearing in the 
Register or addressed to such person at such 
address as the holder or joint holders may in 
writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall, 
unless the holder or joint holders otherwise direct, 
be made payable to the order of the holder or, in 
the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder 
whose name stands first in the Register in respect 
of such shares, and shall be sent at their or their 
risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the 
bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good 
discharge to the Company. Any one of two (2) or 
more joint holders may give effectual receipts for 
any dividends, distributions or other monies 
payable or property distributable in respect of the 
shares held by such joint holders. (b) All dividends, 
distributions or interests in respect of shares held 
by a securities depository, including Euroclear 
Nederland, shall be paid by placing those 
dividends, distributions or interest at the disposal 
of such securities depository, subject to and in 
compliance with the regulations of such 
securities depository. 
6.Unclaimed Amounts. Any dividend or distribution 
out of contributed surplus unclaimed for a period 
of five (5) years from the date of declaration of 
such dividend or distribution shall be forfeited 
and shall revert to the Company and the payment 
by the Board of any unclaimed dividend, 
distribution, interest or other sum payable on or 
in respect of the share into a separate account 
shall not constitute the Company a trustee in 
respect thereof.
