What we do
As a global liquidity provider and market maker, we 
provide continuous liquidity as well as actively invest 
and support our partners with our leading 
distribution network and execution capabilities. 
We build and deploy proprietary trading models and 
strategies, enabling us to provide liquidity in a broad 
set of asset classes, regardless of the market 
circumstances. To enable this we continue to 
develop our technology-stack to provide competitive 
pricing and seamless execution.
Furthermore, we actively invest and foster the 
development of market infrastructure to contribute 
to improving transparency and efficiency across 
global financial markets. This is in the form of 
strategic partnerships with both the TradFi as well as 
digital asset partners. 
These activities are executed by our highly skilled 
and talented team who focus on operational 
excellence and create value for our broad set of 
stakeholders. 
Create long-term sustainable value for 
society
Our ESG priorities comprises of three material  
themes: Environmental footprint, Sustainable 
employment and Good governance.
Environment
As we continue to expand our trading footprint to 
ensure that sustainable investment products can be 
traded efficiently, with minimal energy use and 
emissions. We will focus on energy efficiency and 
climate action to reduce our environmental footprint 
from our operations. Social
We prioritize sustainable employment, by creating 
an attractive workplace for all, leveraging an 
experienced talent pool that forms a diverse, and 
entrepreneurial team. Governance 
We must ensure that we always operate with high 
ethical standards in compliance with laws and 
regulations. We will continue to act on our 
responsibilities and fully anchor them in the way we 
do business through our focus on integrated 
governance and accountability, engaging 
stakeholders and transparent reporting.
