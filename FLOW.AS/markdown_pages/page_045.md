As with many tech-driven industries, achieving 
greater gender diversity continues to be a challenge, 
requiring targeted efforts to attract, retain, and 
advance females in these fields. Therefore we deploy 
initiatives to promote trading and technology among 
females. 
Policies related to employment 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Policy
Our DE&I Policy defines our commitment to 
fostering an inclusive workplace where all employees 
are valued and respected. We recognize DE&I as a 
business imperative and have established clear KPIs 
to promote diversity, enhance leadership 
representation, and drive continuous improvement. 
We create a workplace where everyone is welcome 
regardless of e.g., race, ethnicity, nationalities, age, 
gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
gender expression, disability, economic status and 
other diverse backgrounds. 
Human Rights Policy
We are committed to upholding internationally 
recognized human rights standards across our 
operations, supply chains, and the communities in 
which we operate. We are dedicated to protecting 
the human rights of our workforce and other 
stakeholders. We oppose forced labor, child labor, 
and human trafficking across our workforce. Our 
Human Rights Policy, established by Flow Traders 
Ltd., applies to all employees, contingent workers, 
subsidiaries, and business partners. We align with 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human

confidential channel for employees, business 
partners, and other stakeholders to report suspected 
misconduct, unethical behavior, or violations of laws 
and company policies without fear of retaliation. Key 
principles of our policy include confidentiality and 
protection, secure reporting channels, thorough 
investigation, effective resolution, and compliance 
with legal and regulatory requirements.Staff Manual
Our Staff Manual forms an integral part of the 
agreement between the employer and employees. 
The Staff Manual serves to clarify the rights and 
obligations of the employer and its employees with 
respect to personal records, working condition, 
business travel, performance management and 
more. Flow Traders does not have a formalized 
accident prevention policy, however accidents and 
incidents can be raised through the departmental 
incident reporting mechanisms.

We offer a diverse range of L&D opportunities 
tailored to every business department to enhance 
and elevate professional skills, which is available to 
our employees in the Staff Manual. Beyond role-
specific training, we provide non-functional courses 
aimed at guiding employees on their career 
navigation journey. We encourage internal mobility 
across departments and our global offices, fostering 
a culture of continuous learning and self-discovery.
