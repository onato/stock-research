Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and the 
determination of the result
In setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and 
liabilities and determination of the result for its parent Company financial 
statements, the Group applies the option provided in section 2:362 (8) of the 
Netherlands Civil Code. The principles for the recognition and measurement of 
assets and liabilities and determination of the result (hereinafter referred to as 
principles for recognition and measurement) of the parent Company financial 
statements are the same as those applied for the consolidated IFRS Accounting 
Standards financial statements. Participating interests over which the Company 
has significant influence, are measured at equity value. Please see Notes to the 
consolidated financials statements for a description of the Group’s IFRS 
Accounting Standards principles.
The profit from participating interests consists of the Company’s share in the 
results of these participating interests. Results on transactions, comparing the 
transfer of assets and liabilities between (i) the Group and its participating 
interests on (ii) between participating interests themselves, are not recognized.
