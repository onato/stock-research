EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy is a centerpiece of the EU actions 
to support the transition to a sustainable economy, in 
which the financial sector plays a vital role. It aims to 
provide a basis for harmonized and comparable 
disclosures related to economic activities that 
qualifies as environmentally sustainable. 
To provide investors meaningful information about 
the ESG performance of an investment or fund, we 
believe that an international applied Taxonomy 
framework, unified definitions and an open-access 
data source are key for the practical implementation 
of the EU Taxonomy.  
Environmental objectives
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system used to 
determine, and report on, which activities are 
sustainable. For corporate activities to be considered 
sustainable under the Taxonomy, they must: 
▪Substantially contribute to at least one of the six 
environmental objectives per the Technical 
Screening Criteria (TSC) defined in the Regulation; 
▪Do no significant harm to any of the remaining 
five environmental objectives
▪Comply with the minimum social safeguards
Applicable reporting requirements
Reporting requirements for Flow Traders: In 
compliance with section 2.4. of Annex VII Disclosures 
Delegated Act (DDA), investment firms should 
compute the GAR for their services and activities 
dealing on own account by relying on the turnover 
KPI and CapEx KPI of investee undertakings for each 
environmental objective.The calculations for the turnover-based and CapEx-
based KPIs of investee companies are specified per 
type of investee company in Annex VII DDA, section 
2.4., third paragraph, points (a) to (e). The KPIs for 
investment firms’ activities other than dealing on 
own accounts should be calculated mutatis 
mutandis using turnover-based and CapEx-based 
KPIs of counterparties of their clients (Annex VII DDA, 
section 3.3.).
Data availability
We conducted a data assessment to gain an 
overview of the required data points needed for Flow 
Traders’ EU Taxonomy GAR disclosure. Our 
assessment consists of five steps, each with detailed 
procedures to evaluate the feasibility of such 
reporting:
▪Step 1: Understanding the GAR calculation 
▪Step 2: Understanding the data points and other 
data requirements
▪Step 3: Assessing the feasibility of obtaining the 
required the data points
▪Step 4: Testing the Flow Traders’ EU Taxonomy – 
KPI GAR reporting
▪Step 5: The use of data sets from external data 
providers
Based on this comprehensive assessment, we 
conclude the following: Flow Traders is entirely 
dependent on external (market) data providers to 
compile the GAR reporting. We have reached out to 
our market data provider for EMEA ETPs and ETFs, 
however our assessment into the available market 
data shows that the portion of relevant data for GAR 
and EU Taxonomy-aligned activities is very limited. 
Only a fraction of the ‘assets held for trading’ are 
covered by available data. Given the novelty and 
evolving nature of sustainability-related disclosures – 
where the EU, US, and Asia are progressing at different paces – we believe that the EU Taxonomy 
KPI, despite its limitations, should be accompanied 
by contextual information to facilitate the 
appropriate interpretation of disclosures made by 
market makers.
In light of this, we strongly advocate that the 
European Commission revisit the scope and KPIs of 
financial undertakings, distinguishing between 
investment firms dealing on their own account that 
a) have a direct influence on investment strategies 
and b) those that do not take such positions. 
Our 2024 EU Taxonomy reporting
As a result, Flow Traders is unable to meet the EU 
Taxonomy reporting requirements. For the 2024 
Annual Report EU Taxonomy disclosure, Flow Traders 
will report a ‘zero value’ for Green Asset Ratio (GAR) 
and EU Taxonomy-aligned activities.
This conclusion is based on the EU Commission 
Notice dated 21 December 2023, which provides 
guidance on handling data constraints in FAQ point 
5: ‘What should financial undertakings report if 
counterparty entities’ KPIs are not publicly available 
or are inaccurate?’
In compliance with Article 8(4) of the Disclosures 
Delegated Act, financial undertakings must use the 
most recently available information and KPIs of their 
counterparties for their Taxonomy-alignment 
reporting. However, when such KPIs are not publicly 
or readily available, financial undertakings are 
encouraged to contact those counterparties. If, 
despite efforts, relevant KPIs cannot be obtained or 
remain unfit, or if KPIs from previous years are also 
unavailable, the exposure should be considered non-
eligible or not aligned. In such cases, financial 
undertakings are to enter a ‘zero value.’
