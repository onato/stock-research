Base salary
In 2024, Owain Lloyd joined the firm as CTO and 
member of the Flow Traders Board. Alongside Mike 
Kuehnel (CEO) and Hermien Smeets-Flier (CFO), our 
Executive Directors receive an annual base salary of 
€300,000. This modest base salary is in line with our 
remuneration philosophy, which heavily relies on 
variable remuneration based on positive Company 
performance.
Variable remuneration
The design of our variable remuneration reflects our 
remuneration principles. We operate a single 
incentive plan that drives and rewards both annual 
and long-term performance with a significant focus 
on the long-term through the multi-year pay-out 
mechanism and half of the award being paid in Flow 
Traders equity. The value of the equity is directly 
linked to performance of the Flow Traders’ share 
price from the date of grant to vesting. Further, any 
outstanding variable remuneration (deferred or 
unvested) remains at risk in full for future years. In 
line with our guiding principles, the Executive 
Directors share in the same firm-wide variable 
remuneration pool as all other employees. This pool 
of variable remuneration is primarily a function of 
operating results. While this structure is uncommon 
among listed companies, it is in line with the practice 
in our industry among both listed and non-listed 
peer companies, and necessary to be able to attract, 
retain and motivate individuals of the highest caliber.
Executive Directors performance assessment
To determine the Executive Directors’ variable 
remuneration awards, the Non-Executive Directors 
conduct a holistic assessment of the performance of 
each Executive Director and the Executive Directors 
as a whole in accordance with a defined scorecard. In 
this holistic performance assessment, the Non-
Executive Directors consider performance against 
Company targets, which have a weight of 70% of their variable compensation and include both 
financial and sustainability KPIs. To ensure a 
balanced assessment, our KPIs do not have pre-
determined weightings, allowing the Remuneration 
& Appointment Committee to determine the overall 
outcome and ensure appropriateness in wider 
circumstances. Objectives for the KPIs included in 
the scorecard are set prior to the beginning of the 
year and where appropriate quantitative targets are 
predefined to ensure the assessment is robust. 
Individual performance is assessed alongside 
Company performance with a 30% weighting to 
determine the final variable compensation 
outcomes. Below we present the Company KPIs and 
the explanation on the performance assessment as 
conducted for 2024. Total remuneration amounts are 
formally capped for any individual Executive Director 
of the Board at 20 times the average FTE total 
remuneration.
Performance assessment
The Company performance scorecard is focused on 
six specific performance criteria. The criteria were 
chosen to align with our business, our strategy and 
include a range of financial and sustainability 
metrics. During 2024 similar Company performance 
criteria were applied as in 2023 (with a change in the 
Normalized EBITDA margin to EBITDA margin), with 
a weighting of 70%. The remaining 30% is based on 
individual performance metrics. 
The criteria were set ahead of the performance 
period, ensuring that the achievement of targets is 
challenging, and were as follows:
1. Median daily net trading income (NTI) 
normalized for volatility:
We believe that the median daily NTI normalized by 
volatility provides a statistically clean picture of 
overall business growth. The distribution of daily NTI 
is not normally distributed but more shaped like a Poisson or Gamma distribution with a few negatives 
days and more higher profitability days. Due to the 
fact that the higher profitability days are 
independent, a simple average of daily NTI is 
statistically less relevant than the median of the daily 
NTI. It is Flow Traders’ ambition to increase this 
median NTI for equal volatility scenarios. Therefore, it 
is necessary to normalize the observed daily NTI by 
the volatility. Since volatility does not have a linear 
effect, but a moderately exponential impact, it has 
been determined that the most appropriate 
calculation option is to divide the daily median NTI by 
the square root of the volatility. This exercise has 
been performed on our historical results and the 
average VIX value has been used to normalize the 
NTI. It is important to note that for a business with a 
global footprint which is exposed to multiple 
different asset classes, VIX is a simplified proxy for 
overall volatility (VIX is the implied volatility of the 
S&P500). However, it does provide a measure of 
general market sentiment. 
The target value set by the Company is to have this 
metric increase by 10 points every year which equals 
an increase of approximately €50,000 per trading 
day. The target for this metric was set at 247 for 2024 
and Flow Traders achieved an actual result of 350.
2. EBITDA margin  
EBITDA margin is a profitability ratio that measures 
how much in earnings a company is generating 
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, 
as a percentage of the total income.
The target for this metric was set at 34.3% for 2024, 
this is reflective of prior annual outcomes and is at a 
level which ensures a sustainable and growing 
business for all internal and external stakeholders. 
Flow Traders achieved an actual result of 45%.
