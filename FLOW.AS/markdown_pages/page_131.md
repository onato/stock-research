Other price risk
Equity price risk and commodity price risk arises from trading positions as well as 
the Group’s investments in investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income or through profit or loss. In addition, for its option 
positions, the implied volatility of the underlying contract is an additional risk 
factor. Other factors to consider are time and dividend expectations.
The Group manages other price risks by defined limits in terms of individual 
positions per product and aggregate position per trading desk relating to the 
size of the exposure, concentrations, pricing and valuation parameters and 
natural hedging between these long and short positions. As the Group is active 
in liquidity provision and does not speculate on directional moves in underlying 
values, the net delta positions of the portfolios should be close to zero.
In addition to daily internal monitoring measures, applicable haircut and 
margins are computed by the Group’s prime brokers. The haircut analysis 
measures all positions, individual and correlated, and reflects the different risk 
components. The third-party haircut calculation confirms the internal 
assessment that completes the Group’s overview of the risks that it is exposed to 
on a daily and overnight basis. An overview of the overall market risk is presented 
under the earlier "Market risk" section.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the 
obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering 
cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to 
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without 
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The 
Group’s cash position, as well as the other available credit lines with prime 
brokers, is monitored on a daily basis.Maturity based on contractual undiscounted cash flows is as follows:

Concentration risk
Concentration risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in 
similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have 
similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual 
obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other 
conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s 
performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic 
location. The Group’s policies and procedures and the broad geographic and 
industry spread of its activities limit its exposure to any concentration risk. 
Additionally management has established credit limits for geographic and 
counterparty exposures, which are monitored on a daily basis. We monitor the 
distribution of assets and off-balance sheet items by geographic region and 
industry sector on an ongoing basis.
