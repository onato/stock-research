Shares held by employees and Executive 
Board members
We have a long-standing philosophy of encouraging 
management and employee share ownership, 
creating alignment between the Company’s long-
term success and individual personal financial 
circumstances. Since IPO, we have utilized a number 
of share schemes. In connection with the IPO a 
significant number of current and former employees 
invested in Flow Traders. Subsequently, the Flow 
Traders Cash Incentive Plan (FCIP) and Flow Traders 
Loyalty Incentive Plan (FLIP) were introduced. The 
FCIP was replaced in 2020 by a new share plan which 
provides for the award up to 50% of variable 
remuneration in shares (or share-like instruments).31 December 2024
