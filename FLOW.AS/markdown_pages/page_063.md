Message from the Chairman
Dear Stakeholders,
I would like to begin by expressing my sincere 
gratitude to our shareholders for their ongoing 
support and openness to engage in meaningful 
dialogue with our Board. This year, we had the 
privilege of discussing several key topics central to 
Flow Traders’ growth and diversification strategies. 
These engagements are vital in fostering 
constructive conversations that help shape our 
shared vision for the Company’s future.
In 2024, the Board remained focused on its 
commitment to supporting our leadership team as 
they worked to deliver tangible proof points of our 
strategy. In our advisory and consultative capacity, 
we provided guidance on several pivotal initiatives 
that accelerated Flow Traders’ growth over the past 
year. These included the introduction of the Trading 
Capital Expansion Plan and the associated 
suspension of dividends, fostering a culture of risk 
awareness and collaboration, and strengthening our 
leadership team with the appointment of Owain 
Lloyd as CTO.
Marking 20 years 
Most importantly, 2024 marked Flow Traders’ 20th 
anniversary as a trading firm, a remarkable milestone 
in our journey. From our beginnings as an ETP 
trading house, we have evolved into a global leader 
in liquidity provision, driving innovation and 
transparency across financial markets worldwide. 
This achievement is a testament to the exceptional 
talent within our team and the invaluable 
partnerships we have cultivated over the years.As we reflect on the past and look ahead, we remain 
dedicated to advancing our mission to make 
financial markets more transparent, efficient, and 
accessible. On behalf of the Board, I extend my 
heartfelt thanks to all who have contributed to Flow 
Traders’ success so far. Together, we will continue to 
shape the future of financial markets.
Engagement with Flow Traders’ team
As a Board, we had the privilege of visiting our team 
in New York, an experience that was particularly 
impactful for each of us. This visit provided a fantastic 
opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the 
business, connect with the team, and acquire 
valuable insights into our Americas operations.
These learnings, combined with our regular 
engagements during Board meetings, where we 
interact with leaders across Trading, Technology, and 
Business Support, enhance our ability to serve the 
organization effectively as Non-Executive Board 
members.
Strong business performance
Flow Traders recorded a record fourth quarter in 
2024 and second-best year in terms of financial 
performance in our 20-year history. As a result of the 
overall increase in market activity over the year, we 
recorded net trading income of € 467.8 million and 
net profit of € 159.5 million for the financial year 2024, 
which was well above our financial performance in 
the prior year.Strategic priorities and initiatives
During our 2024 AGM, we shared the core four pillars 
of the Flow Traders’ strategy, and outlined actions to 
deliver into these pillars. 
Capital is the lifeblood of trading and in 2Q, we 
announced our Trading Capital Expansion Plan. This 
strategic move was aimed at strengthening our 
capital base in order to leverage opportunities in the 
market. The team has demonstrated the success of 
this initiative by delivering a strong financial 
performance and immediately extracting value from 
the expanded capital base. 
We continued to demonstrate our ability to leverage 
and expand proprietary infrastructure, with a 
strategic focus on China and the broader APAC 
region. These efforts have strengthened our 
operations and network, positioning us for sustained 
growth in the future.
Our commitment to technology and innovation was 
further bolstered by the election of Owain Lloyd as 
CTO. With his expertise and leadership, we are 
confident in our ability to advance our technology 
stack and enhance our capabilities, driving 
continued progress and innovation across the global 
financial landscape. 
Throughout 2024, Flow Traders Strategic Capital 
continued to build strong relationships, with a 
particular highlight being AllUnity, our partnership 
with DWS and Galaxy Digital.
