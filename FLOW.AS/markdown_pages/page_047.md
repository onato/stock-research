Good governance

building the right structures and preventing 
misconduct. This culture is driven by leadership tone, 
accountability, and open communication. Leadership 
must set the right example through role modelling 
our core values, shaping the ethical foundation our 
Company. 
How we can contribute
Our commitment to ethical behavior is laid down in 
our Code of Conduct, which is based on our values 
and how we define our corporate culture. We expect 
every employee to uphold to the Code of Conduct, 
ensuring a safe working environment and a respect 
for human rights. We embed our core values into 
business conduct, providing guidance through 
shared beliefs, a clear purpose, mission, norms, and 
transparent ways of working. A strong ethical 
foundation mitigates risks of, such as misconduct, 
non-compliance, business disruption, legal 
challenges and reputational damage.

the highest standards of integrity are fundamental to 
creating value for our stakeholders and ensuring our

procedures, which detail our principles and 
compliance standards, serve as a compass for 
making the right decisions and staying true to our 
values. Please refer to the corporate documents

Challenges we face

alongside financial regulations, and cybersecurity 
requirements, we navigate an increasingly complex 
compliance landscape and obligations. Challenge lies 
in the various compliance and incident reporting, 
with multiple processes of which some using their 
own systems. To enhance transparency, efficiency, 
and regulatory alignment, centralizing incident 
reporting is a priority for us.Measuring our impact
Our compliance program is designed to identify, 
assess, and manage the impacts and risks associated 
with actual and potential incidents. We promote and 
uphold ethical behavior, fostering a corporate culture 
where speaking up is encouraged and appreciated. 
Our metric compliance awareness score reflects our 
commitment to compliance reporting and risk 
management. All employees are responsible for 
reporting incidents whenever they encounter a 
suspect of (potential) breach of our Code of Conduct 
or compliance manual. An incident is defined as any 
event involving a (potential) breach of our 
compliance policies that necessitates further action. 
The departmental incident reporting policies drive
