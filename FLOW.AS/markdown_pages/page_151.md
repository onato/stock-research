We determined materiality and identified and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to 
design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Materiality
Materiality €9.8 million (2023: €2.2 million)
Benchmark applied 5% of profit before tax (rounded)
Explanation Based on our professional judgment and our 
perception of the financial information needs of the 
users of the financial statements, a benchmark of 5% of 
profit before tax is an appropriate quantitative indicator 
of materiality as profit before tax best reflects the 
financial performance of Flow Traders. We determined 
materiality consistently with the previous financial year, 
as a result our materiality reflects the increase in profit 
before tax as compared to previous financial year.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements 
that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for 
qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the audit committee of the board (hereinafter: the audit 
committee) that misstatements in excess of €0.5 million, which are identified 
during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements 
that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
Flow Traders is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this 
group is included in the financial statements.
We are responsible for planning and performing the group audit to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the 
financial statements. We are also responsible for the direction, supervision, review 
and evaluation of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We 
bear the full responsibility for the auditor’s report.Based on our understanding of the group and its environment, the applicable 
financial framework and the group’s system of internal control, we identified and 
assessed risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and the 
significant accounts and disclosures. Based on this risk assessment, we 
determined the nature, timing and extent of audit work performed, including the 
entities or business units within the group (components) at which to perform 
audit work. For this determination we considered the nature of the relevant 
events and conditions underlying the identified risks of material misstatements 
for the financial statements, the association of these risks to components and the 
materiality or financial size of the components relative to the group. We 
communicated the audit work to be performed and identified risks through 
instructions for component auditors as well as requesting component auditors to 
communicate matters related to the financial information of the component that 
is relevant to identifying and assessing risks.
We have: 
▪Performed audit work ourselves at group entities (components): Flow Traders 
Ltd., Flow Traders B.V., INIT Capital B.V., Flow Traders Holding LLC, Flow Traders 
US Holding LLC and Flow Traders Investments Limited. 
▪Performed audit procedures ourselves in respect of areas such as investments, 
fair value adjustments of trading positions, variable personnel expenses, 
impairment of equity-accounted investees, taxes and transfer pricing and net 
trading positions.
▪Used the work of another (non-EY) auditor working under our supervision for 
auditing the group entities: Flow Traders U.S. LLC and Flow Traders 
Institutional Trading LLC (the Flow Traders US operating entities). Moreover, we 
are also directly involved in parts of the audit work by auditing certain accounts 
centrally for Flow Trader U.S. LLC and communicating regularly with the 
component’s management.
▪Used the audit work of a component auditor from an EY Global member firm 
working under our supervision for the following entities: Flow Traders Asia Pte. 
Ltd., Flow Traders Hong Kong Services Limited, and Flow Traders Hong Kong 
Limited (the Flow Traders Singapore and Hong Kong entities).
This resulted in a coverage of 92% of profit before tax, 99% of total income and 95% 
of total assets.
