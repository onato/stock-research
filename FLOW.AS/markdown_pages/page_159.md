Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements
Responsibilities of the board for the financial statements
The board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and Part 9 of Book 2 of 
the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the board is responsible for such internal control 
as the board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board is responsible for 
assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the 
financial reporting framework mentioned, the board should prepare the financial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board either 
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. The board should disclose events and circumstances that 
may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in the financial statements. 
The audit committee undertakes preparatory work for the board’s decision-making 
regarding the supervision of the integrity and quality of the company’s financial 
reporting. Working within the board, the audit committee is charged in particular 
with the supervision with respect to the provision of financial information by the 
company.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows 
us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, 
which means we may not detect all material misstatements, whether due to fraud 
or error during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The 
materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the 
evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional 
skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing 
and ISAs, ethical requirements and independence requirements. The Information in 
support of our opinion section above includes an informative summary of our 
responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.
Our audit further included among others:
▪Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
▪Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control
▪Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the 
board
▪Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial 
statements, including the disclosures
▪Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
Communication
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
