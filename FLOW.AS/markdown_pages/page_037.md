Preparation of the 2024 sustainability 
information
Our materiality framework is designed to reflect the 
requirements from, among others, the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), DMA 
guidance and industry best practices. We conduct a 
comprehensive DMA every three years, 
supplemented by annual reviews our material topics 
in light of new insights, evolving stakeholder 
expectations, shifts in the regulatory landscape, and 
the progress we have achieved. 
In late 2023, we completed a comprehensive 
materiality assessment based on double materiality 
principles.
The assessment leveraged ESRS, entity-specific 
considerations and industry-leading practices. The 
DMA includes the impact and financial materiality to 
address societal , business conduct and 
environmental imp acts as well as the financial 
implications of sustainability-related risks and 
opportunities.Flow Traders material topics
