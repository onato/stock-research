Risk reporting
Flow Traders has a Financial & Capital Risk  
Committee and a Non-Financial Risk & Compliance 
Committee that continuously assess the risks we face 
in our business, and are comprised of our Global 
Head of Risk and Compliance, the Executive 
Directors and certain members of our senior 
leadership. 
Aside from regular communication, there are  
quarterly Financial & Capital Risk and Non-Financial 
Risk & Compliance Committee meetings. During 
these meetings we discuss all risk assessments and 
risk proposals related to position limits, strategies, 
procedures, liquidity and capital requirements, 
regulatory compliance, AML, incidents and market 
developments. Any material change to our risk 
profile, systems, strategies and limits must 
subsequently be approved by the Financial & Capital 
Risk and Non-Financial Risk & Compliance 
Committees. 
In addition to these standing Committees, we have a 
Risk & Sustainability Committee, all members of the 
Board are members. The Global Head of Risk and 
Compliance informs the Risk & Sustainability 
Committee about the effectiveness of the internal 
risk management and control systems. This includes 
the reasonable assurance that the aforementioned 
systems do not contain any material inaccuracies. 
The tasks of the Risk & Sustainability Committee 
include supervision and monitoring, and advising the 
Executive Directors, and Global Heads of Trading on 
the operation of the Company’s internal risk 
management and control systems. As well as 
providing advice on the Company’s development, 
performance, sustainability of its trading strategies 
and reviewing the risk of the Company.
