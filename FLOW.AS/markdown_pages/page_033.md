Where we have a technical interface with institutions 
such as our prime brokers and exchanges, the 
integrity of the connection between the systems and 
the data that is being exchanged is subject to prior 
conformance testing and continuous monitoring. 
Unexpected deviations are flagged and investigated. 
We also have a disaster recovery plan in place which, 
we continuously review to ensure it adequately 
captures relevant scenarios. 
We use risk-based onboarding procedures before we 
start trading on any new platforms, including 
platforms designated for trading digital assets. While 
many of these platforms remain unregulated, many 
have strongly improved their own onboarding 
procedures and counterparty identification 
procedures. While we believe our own procedures 
are strong, the unregulated status of these platforms 
and their location in emerging economies makes 
them inherently less institutionalized and supervised 
than regulated platforms in developed economies. 
We therefore subject these platforms to increased 
monitoring and due diligence.
Technology risk 
While the firm’s foundation is technology-driven, 
these risks and impacts are reflected and linked with 
the above categories. Specifically, under technology 
risks, we have carved out cyber risks to highlight a 
key component that the firm considers high priority. 
Cyber security risk 
Cyber security is the risk of not protecting computer 
systems, networks and data from digital attacks, 
unauthorized access and therefore posing damage 
or disruption to the firm. 
Cyber security risk management is the process of 
identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and addressing an organization's cyber security threats. The goal is to 
protect the organization's information systems from 
cyber attacks and data breaches while minimizing 
potential damage. The cyber security risk category 
was established together with the formalization of 
the risk appetite in 2024 to ensure a more focused 
approach to mitigating related cyber and 
information security risks. 
Over 2024, the firm has put in extensive efforts 
throughout multiple departments to ensure 
compliance with the Digital Operational Resilience 
Act (DORA) in force from January 2025. Whilst not all 
secondary legislative acts and regulatory guidelines 
are complete and implemented, the firm at this 
moment believes to be compliant with the DORA 
regulation.
Internal Audit (IA) 
The IA function seeks to enhance and protect 
organizational value by providing risk-based and 
objective assurance, advice, and insight. An effective 
IA contributes to strong internal controls and to a 
robust governance structure, which can address key 
structural risks. 
The scope of IA's work includes the examination and 
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of our  
risk management, control and governance 
processes. It also includes quality assurance work 
reviewing our performance in carrying out assigned 
responsibilities to achieve our stated goals and 
objectives.
Our Group IA Charter defines the IA’s purpose, 
authority, responsibility and position within the 
organization. This charter is aligned with the 
Corporate Governance Code and with guidance 
provided by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).The IA function is an integral part of our reporting 
cycle. The IA function reports to the Audit Committee 
and to the CEO. It aligns its efforts with our external 
auditor and reports its audit results to the Board, the 
Audit Committee and informs the external auditor.
The Board assesses the way in which the IA function 
fulfills its responsibility annually and takes the 
opinion of the Audit Committee into account. 
Flow Traders IA function conforms to the 
International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) 
of the IIA.
