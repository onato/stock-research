Comparative overview of Company performance and remuneration
The long-standing foundation of our Remuneration Policy reflects a relatively 
modest base salary and variable remuneration that is aligned with Company 
performance – which varies each year depending on successful or less successful 
(financial) years. This is clearly illustrated in the table below which shows the 
development of the Company performance and the awarded (full-time) 
remuneration of executives and average employee remuneration over the last   
five years. 
Internal pay ratios
The 2024 pay ratio (CEO total pay vs. average total employee pay) is 7.92 compared 
to 4.33 in 2023. This is well below the cap of 20 times average total employee pay.Scenario analyses 
The Board carries out yearly scenario analyses when determining the structure 
and level of Executive Director remuneration outcomes, in accordance with the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code. 
This includes the calculation of remuneration under different scenarios, whereby 
different performance assumptions are considered. By considering different 
performance assumptions, the possible outcomes of variable components and the 
resulting impact on the total remuneration of the Executive Directors is 
understood and examined. The Board believes the current remuneration structure 
and outcomes are appropriate and aligned with shareholder experiences. The 
Board will continue to assess the adequacy of the remuneration structure, 
including performance measures used for variable remuneration components.
