i)Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under 
short-term cash variable compensation or (profit-sharing) structures if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of 
past services provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated 
reliably. If the Group incurs a loss in a certain reporting period, there will be no 
obligation to pay the cash variable compensation.
j)Share based payments
When employees render services as consideration for equity instruments, the 
expense is recognized in employee expenses, together with a corresponding 
increase in equity, both calculated based on the fair value of the instruments 
granted and over the period in which the service conditions are fulfilled (the 
vesting period). The fair value of equity-settled transactions granted to 
employees is determined by the fair value of the shares at the date when the 
grant is made. The awards vest in tranches on various dates over a total period of 
up to five years. Vesting is conditional upon the employee being actively 
employed by the Group on the vesting date. If the employment is terminated or 
if the employee resigns, any unvested tranches of the award will be forfeited. The 
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting 
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest.
The fair value of share appreciation rights (SARs) granted to employees, which 
are cash-settled, is recognized in employee expenses, together with a 
corresponding increase in other liabilities, over the period during which the 
service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The liability is remeasured at 
the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes 
in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Estimates used are reassessed at the end 
of each reporting period . These estimates are based on the fair value of the 
parent entity share price (which does not materially differ from the option price 
model) and consider the extent to which the employees have rendered services 
as at the reporting date as well as the likelihood that the employees will be 
employed by the Group at the vesting date.k)Other liabilities held for trading 
As part of its trading activities, the Group enters into digital asset payables. The 
borrowed digital assets payables are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Additionally, the Group may borrow digital assets as part of market making 
arrangements. The Group measures these liabilities at fair value. Certain 
arrangements contain options to settle the borrowed digital assets. The Group 
has concluded that the market making arrangements and the options cannot 
be separated and are initially valued at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred and subsequently measured at fair value. The options are valued using 
an option pricing model to which there is a material source of estimation 
uncertainty from estimates of volatility levels (see note 8(a)).
At initial recognition, any difference between the fair value and the transaction 
price is not recognized in profit or loss immediately but is deferred over the life of 
the arrangement, unless the fair value on initial recognition is evidenced by a 
quoted price in an active market or based on valuation techniques to which 
unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant. The difference between 
transaction price and initial fair value which is not yet recognized in profit or loss 
is recognized in other liabilities held for trading on the Consolidated statement 
of financial position. The amount of the deferred profit or loss which has been 
recognized in the current period’s profit or loss is included in the gross trading 
income line on the Consolidated statement of profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income. 
Please see note 8(f) for additional information.
l)Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized 
as finance cost. 
Provisions made in the current year are recognized in the Provisions line item of 
the Consolidated statement of financial position and within Other expenses in 
the Statement of profit or loss.
