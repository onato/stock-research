Key risks detailed 
Key financial risk 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk management is vital to maintain a 
robust financial institution. Liquidity risk is defined as 
the risk that Flow Traders Ltd. cannot meet its 
financial liabilities when they become due, at a 
reasonable cost and in a timely manner. We have a 
robust framework in place to manage liquidity risks, 
as insufficient liquidity can pose an immediate threat 
to the continuity of trading activities.
The liquidity risk framework includes, among others, 
requirements and processes related to the 
maintenance of the liquidity buffer, both in a 
‘business-as-usual’ and under potential stress 
situations. Furthermore, the framework contains 
procedures to actively manage liquidity risk across 
asset classes, countries, legal entities and in multiple 
currencies. This includes taking into account 
regulatory- and operational requirements for the 
maintenance of adequate liquidity.
Furthermore, we define liquidity as the sum of excess 
liquidity over the requirement (haircut) at our prime 
brokers, as that is the basis for being able to facilitate 
all funding and liquidity needs. Given our business 
model as a market maker where we generally hedge 
any position taken instantly, our key liquidity risk is 
not so much in risking a significant loss, but rather in 
not being able to cover the requirements our prime 
brokers charge us. Therefore, our key liquidity risks 
are those that affect either the total pool of liquid 
assets we hold at our prime brokers and crypto 
exchanges or the total requirement that our prime 
brokers necessitate us to hold with them (haircut).Market risk
Flow Traders is exposed to market risk arising from 
trading positions in instruments that are price-
sensitive to various factors such as company 
valuations, interest rates, FX rates, commodities and 
digital asset prices. As a liquidity provider we 
continuously provide bid and offer prices in multiple 
product groups across multiple financial markets. 
The bid and offer prices are calibrated such that the 
expected value of the trades and the hedges are 
positive while the resulting market risk is immaterial.
We have a multitude of trading desks which are 
providing liquidity in various products and various 
markets. The core business being equity and fixed 
income products and the Company also trades FX, 
commodities and digital assets. Each individual desk 
trades (close to) delta neutral hereby ensuring total 
market risk is therefore close to delta neutral. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty and/or issuing 
institution involved in trading in or issuing a financial 
instrument defaulting on its obligation. As part of our 
credit risk framework, Flow Traders monitors 
platform credit risk on a real-time basis against an 
established credit risk limit. In addition, Flow Traders 
has real-time monitoring on platform assets in- and 
out-flows to be able to anticipate on a platform 
insolvency event. Furthermore, funding is spread 
across multiple platforms and counterparties 
ensuring a diversified allocation that greatly limits 
the impact of a possible credit risk or liquidation 
event. The Company manages credit risk through its 
Risk and Mid-Office department that provide specific 
guidelines, rules and procedures for identifying, 
measuring and reporting credit risk. Policies include 
amongst others: ▪limits for individual product types;
▪limits per counterparty;
▪limits on the duration of the exposure; 
▪limits for settlement types; 
▪strict monitoring procedures for late settlements.
Throughout 2024, improvements were made within 
the digital asset space noting enhancements of the 
credit risk framework including the establishment of 
a centralized view of all credit limits and automation 
of limit breaches and alerts.
Business and strategic risk
Concentration risk (Market business risk)  
Our NTI and profitability are primarily a function of 
the level of trading activity, or trading volumes, in the 
financial instruments in which we trade, and the bid-
ask spreads (which largely determine the profit on 
the trade, or margins, we capture). 
Trading volumes in securities, derivatives, currencies, 
commodities, cryptocurrencies and other financial 
instruments on exchange and on other trading 
venues are directly affected by factors beyond our 
control, including economic and political conditions, 
broad trends in business and finance, regulatory 
requirements, actions by central banks, and changes 
in the markets in which such transactions occur.
To cope with periods of low market activity, we have 
diversified our trading into different products and 
markets. This is to safeguard that we are not overly 
dependent on market activity in one particular asset 
class or product type.
