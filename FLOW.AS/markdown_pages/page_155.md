Existence, rights and obligations and valuation of digital assets
RiskAt 31 December 2024, the other assets held for trading including 
digital assets traded on centralized and decentralized exchanges 
amounted to €625.0 million (2023: €213.9 million) as disclosed in 
Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Digital assets are exchangeable directly between two parties 
through decentralized networks that record transaction and 
position data, which is publicly observable on the blockchain. 
These are digital assets kept in private wallets, which are each 
safeguarded by a private key. As these private keys grant access 
to the digital assets, the safeguarding of these keys are of high 
importance and there is a risk related to compromised private 
keys or misappropriation of the digital assets. Contradictory to 
digital assets kept in private wallets, direct trades on centralized 
exchanges and related positions in digital assets cannot be 
observed on the blockchain, as the digital assets on these 
centralized exchanges are stored in commingled wallets. 
Ownership is established based on legal terms. Digital assets 
prices are based on the market data from the various exchanges 
where prices vary per exchange. The exchanges are unregulated 
and due to the lack of transparency of transactions and positions 
there is an increased risk to existence, rights and obligations and 
valuation of indicated positions. Reference is made to the 
information on digital assets in Note 8 and Note 36 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Due to the risks involved for both digital assets kept in private 
wallets and in commingled wallets, judgements required to 
establish prices and verification of the quantity of digital assets 
owned by the company, we considered existence, rights and 
obligations and valuation of digital assets a key audit matter.
Our audit 
approachOur audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the 
appropriateness of Flow Traders’ accounting policies related to 
the classification and measurement of the digital assets under 
IFRS Accounting Standards, including IAS 2 “Inventories” and 
IFRS 13 “Fair value Measurement” and current market practice.Our audit 
approachWe evaluated the design and implementation of controls related 
to digital assets, including reviews performed by the Risk and 
Operations and the Compliance departments in onboarding 
exchanges as well as trading in certain digital assets, involving 
our own experts in the area of auditing digital assets. 
Furthermore, we evaluated the design and implementation of 
the daily trades reconciliation controls and procedures for 
deposits and withdrawals with cryptocurrency exchanges. We 
also evaluated the design and implementation of controls around 
the safeguarding of the private keys.
For digital assets in private wallets, we tested Flow Traders’ 
reconciliation of digital asset ending balances from its books to 
the blockchain and investigated any unusual and other 
reconciling items as at 31 December 2024. We further verified 
that Flow Traders has access to its wallets, and therefore its digital 
assets, before and after the reporting date. For digital assets held 
on centralized exchanges, we observed the positions at the 
majority of the exchanges at year-end to verify the existence and 
rights and obligation thereof.
We evaluated the valuation methodology and consistency of its 
application by the Company. We further tested the valuation of 
individual positions by comparing the internally determined 
prices to independent sources as at 31 December 2024. 
Key 
observationsBased on the procedures performed, we did not identify any 
material audit findings in relation to the rights and obligations, 
existence and valuation of digital assets as at 31 December 2024.
