Leadership statement 2024 
Marking 20 years of driving transparency in 
financial markets 
In 2024, Flow Traders proudly celebrated 20 years of 
providing liquidity and contributing to innovation in 
global financial markets. Throughout our 20 years, 
we have consistently demonstrated the ability to 
adapt and thrive in the evolving financial landscape, 
capturing opportunities in emerging asset classes 
and championing the growth and accessibility of 
ETPs. Our efforts have also played a pivotal role in 
fostering greater transparency and efficiency across 
global financial markets. 
This milestone would not have been possible without 
our incredibly talented team, whose passion, 
entrepreneurial spirit, and unwavering commitment 
have been the foundation of our success. Together 
with our trusted ecosystem of partners we have 
cultivated a culture of innovation that continues to 
shape the future of the industry. 
Building upon our strong foundation 
We further focused on delivering into our strategy 
pillar leverage and build-out proprietary 
infrastructure by developing  our China proposition 
along with improving our collaboration with partners 
in order to fully leverage our capabilities. 
Throughout the year, as a leadership team, we 
prioritized reinforcing the core of our business by 
further strengthening our risk management and 
compliance framework. One overarching priority was 
to further foster responsible behaviors and our risk 
culture across the firm. We believe our culture is a key ingredient to our 
success and it is something we are proud to continue 
to develop, whether through our L&D offering, 
charitable endeavors (Flow Traders Foundation) to 
creating moments to connect, we continually focus 
on team spirit.
