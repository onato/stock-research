whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is 
present.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the 
outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were 
indicative of fraud or non-compliance.
We addressed the risks related to management override of controls, as this risk is 
present in all organizations. For these risks we have performed procedures among 
other things to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may 
represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to 
important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in 
Note 3 (d) to the consolidated financial statements. We have also used data 
analytics to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the 
business rationale (or the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions. 
We evaluated that there are risks of fraud in the gross trading income recognized 
on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, as management may override 
controls around fair value measurement. We describe the audit procedures 
responsive to this risk in our key audit matter “Fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities held for trading”.
Furthermore, we identified a risk related to the private keys of digital asset wallets 
being misappropriated or compromised. We describe the audit procedures 
responsive to this risk in our key audit matter “Existence, rights and obligations 
and valuation of digital assets”.
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, 
directors, internal audit, legal, compliance, human resources, risk management 
and regional directors and the audit committee. 
The fraud risks we identified, enquiries and other available information did not 
lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially 
impacting the view of the financial statements.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations
Flow Traders is subject to many laws and regulations from market regulators and 
for its trading activities on exchanges worldwide where the consequences of non-
compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial 
statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or instructions. We refer to section “Our risk management” section of the annual report for the compliance 
and ethical risk identified by the board and Note 33 “Provisions and contingencies” 
to the financial statements.
We performed appropriate audit procedures regarding compliance with the 
provisions of those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the 
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on 
the financial statements from our general industry experience, through 
discussions with the board and the audit committee, reading minutes, inspection 
of internal audit and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of 
details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.
We inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and 
remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the 
audit. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of 
non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.  
Our audit response related to going concern
As disclosed in Note 3 “Basis of preparation” section b) “Going concern basis of 
accounting” to the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial 
statements, the board made a specific assessment of the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for the foreseeable 
future.
We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with the board, exercising 
professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism. We considered 
whether the board’s going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and 
understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or 
otherwise, contains all relevant events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties 
about going concern. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained
