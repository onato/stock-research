Deferred tax assets  8,059  9,945 
Deferred tax liabilities  (107)  (2,509) 
Deferred tax assets, net  7,952  7,436 
In addition to the movement of deferred tax included in the income tax expense 
in the statement of profit or loss,  an amount of € 1.3 million is reported through   
other comprehensive income relating to investments at fair value through other 
comprehensive income.
During 2024 we have moved an amount of € 1.1 million between Current tax and 
Deferred tax, partially due to realized gains on investments. The remaining 
movement is explained by exchange rate differences. 
In 2024, it was identified that the offsetting criteria had been met within certain 
tax jurisdictions in both 2024 and 2023. As such, a deferred tax liability of €2.6 
million was offset against deferred tax assets in 2024. The 2023 eligible deferred 
tax liability has not been restated as the Group concluded it was immaterial.16. Cash and cash equivalents
