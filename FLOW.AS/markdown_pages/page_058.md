During the 2024 AGM, our shareholders renewed the 
authority of the Board to purchase shares in the 
capital of the Company, either through purchase on 
a stock exchange or otherwise, up to and including 13 
December 2025, under the following conditions: (i) 
the repurchase may constitute up to 10% of the total 
number of shares issued at the time of the General 
Meeting, (ii) provided that the Company will not hold 
more shares in treasury than 10% of the issued share 
capital and (iii) at a price (excluding expenses) not 
less than the nominal value of the shares and not 
higher than the opening price on Euronext 
Amsterdam on the day of repurchase plus 10%. 
On 22 July 2022, Flow Traders announced a €25 
million share repurchase plan, which was 
subsequently increased with €15 million as 
announced on 27 October 2022, thereby resulting in 
an aggregate €40 million share repurchase plan. On 
28 July 2023 it was further announced that the 
period of execution for the €15 million share 
repurchase increase would be extended by 12 
months to 26 October 2024. Share repurchases for a 
total consideration of €11.8 million w ere made during 
the year ended 31 December 2024 and thus 
completing our share repurchase plan.

the General Meeting to renew its authorization to 
repurchase shares in the Company.Major shareholders
