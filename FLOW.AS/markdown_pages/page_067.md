Committees
During the financial year 2024, the Board operated four committees: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration & Appointment Committee, the Trading & Technology 
Committee, and the Risk & Sustainability Committee. For more information on the functioning and on the responsibilities of the committees, please refer to the chapter 
Corporate governance.
The committees reported to the Board by sharing 
their advice and recommendations during Board 
meetings and by providing an update of the 
deliberations. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee m et nine times in 2024. Other 
attendees besides the committee members included 
the CEO, CFO, CTO, the Global Head of Finance, the 
Head of Investor Relations, the Global Head of 
Internal Audit, the Global Head of Tax, the Global 
Head of Risk and Compliance and the external 
auditor.
During these meetings, the Audit Committee 
discussed the annual results, the half-yearly results 
and the quarterly results. Other topics discussed 
include e.g. significant new and proposed legislative 
initiatives related to accounting, auditing and 
financial reporting, tax planning, tax strategy and 
monitoring, assessing whether there were significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal 
control over financial reporting, the Company’s 
financing strategy and Capital Management Policy 
(including dividend proposals), assessing the 
Company’s compliance with rules and regulations, 
the Company’s Code of Conduct and the methods 
used to assess the effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit processes. Topics discussed with the 
external auditor included the financial statements 
over the financial year 2023, recommendations on 
the basis of the Annual Report, their audit plan for 
the financial year 2024 and their interim review 
report. The Audit Committee reviewed the 
management letter and recommendations included in the auditor’s report, as issued by the external 
auditor and discussed the actions taken by 
leadership to address any recommendations and 
observations. The Audit Committee evaluated the 
performance of the external auditor and discussed 
this with the Board and subsequently with the 
external auditor. In light of this, the Audit Committee 
advised the Board about the reappointment of the 
external auditor for the reporting years 2024 and 
2025, before the Board determined EY's nomination 
for the appointment of the external auditor to the 
General Meeting. Given the nature of our business, 
the application of information and communication 
technology by the Company, including risks relating 
to cyber security, are discussed in detail in the 
Trading & Technology Committee. Subsequently, key 
items in respect of these items are also discussed in 
the Audit Committee.
External auditor
The Audit Committee and the Executive Directors 
reported to the full Board on EY’s functioning as the 
external auditor, the Company’s relationship with the 
external auditor, on its fees, as well as on other audit 
and non-audit services it provided to the Company. 
EY performed a review of the Company’s interim 
financial statements and issued an unqualified 
review report. The Audit Committee evaluated the 
qualifications, performance and independence of EY, 
taking into account the opinions of the Executive 
Directors. The Audit Committee also obtained a 
report from the external auditor regarding, among 
other topics, its internal quality control procedures. 
EY confirmed its independence from Flow Traders in accordance with the professional standards 
applicable to it. Based on the information provided 
by the Audit Committee, the Board nominated EY as 
external auditor for the reporting years 2024 and 
2025 at the Company’s General Meeting in 2024. 
Subsequently, EY was reappointed by the General 
Meeting as external auditor for the reporting years 
2024 and 2025.
The Internal Audit (IA) function 
The IA function carried out all audits that were due 
per the 2024 Internal Audit plan, as approved by the 
Board in October 2023. Focus areas in the 2024 
Internal Audit plan included amongst others trading, 
risk management, IT systems and adherence to 
regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee and 
the Global Head of Internal Audit discussed the 
internal audit results from 2024 (findings, 
observations, recommendations, management 
feedback and follow-up). In October 2024, the Board 
approved an updated version of the Internal Audit 
Charter and approved the risk-based multi-year 
Internal Audit Plan for the years 2025-2027. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee maintains regular 
dialogue with the Global Head of Internal Audit, 
particularly in relation to ongoing audits and 
outstanding audit items.  More information  can be 
found in the chapter Corporate governance.
