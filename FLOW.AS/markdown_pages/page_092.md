Company’s Board on 13 March 2025 subject to adoption by the general meeting

a)Changes to corporate structure 
On 13 January 2023, the Group completed the update to its corporate holding 
structure. This followed receipt of shareholder approval at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting held on 2 December 2022 and fulfillment of all regulatory and  
other customary closing conditions. As a result of the update, the Group’s top 
holding company is now Flow Traders Ltd. The updated of the corporate holding 
structure enables Flow Traders to become more competitive as a global liquidity 
provider, particularly in relation to regulatory capital management. 
As part of the change of its corporate holding structure Flow Traders N.V. 
entered into a cross-border legal merger in which (i) all Flow Traders N.V.'s assets, 
liabilities, rights, obligations and other legal relationships were acquired by Flow 
Traders S.A. incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, (ii) Flow Traders N.V. 
ceased to exist and (iii) each Shareholder received one Flow Traders S.A. share for 
each Flow Traders N.V. share. Following this merger Flow Traders S.A. converted 
into a Bermuda limited company and changed its registered address to 
Bermuda. 
The change in the Group's corporate holding structure had no impact on the 
profit and loss or equity of the Company. A predecessor value method is used to 
determine the carrying value of all assets and liabilities that transfer as part of 
the merger. As at 13 January 2023 the assets and liabilities of Flow Traders N.V. 
are consolidated in the financial statements of Flow Traders S.A. at their carrying 
amount on this date, in accordance with the predecessor value method.
