Cyber security
We have devel oped a robust and advanced 
proprietary trading technology platform that 
underpins our operational excellence and company 
performance. Our commitment to maintaining high 
standards of reliability ensures seamless support for 
our trading activities. We prioritize IT security to 
nurture the trust of our stakeholders, focusing on 
safeguarding our technology, securing data 
exchanges with issuers and counterparties, and 
defending against cyber threats.
Recognizing the intricate nature of our IT landscape, 
we have devised strategies to mitigate risks 
effectively. Our security function is equipped with 
top-tier competencies, governance, and capabilities 
that span our entire IT infrastructure and the 
business at large. We ensure constant access to 
networks, systems, and data by managing risks from 
technical failures, human errors, potential cyber 
threats, and natural disasters proactively.
While the total elimination of cyber risk is elusive, our 
dedication to managing and minimizing system 
disruptions is steadfast. We have robust contingency 
plans in place to ensure business continuity under 
various scenarios. In response to the evolving threat 
landscape, we have implemented clear policies and 
procedures to guide our employees, conducted 
thorough training programs, and fostered a culture 
of security vigilance. These measures ensure our 
team is well-prepared to uphold the highest 
standards of information security.Taxation 
We are co mmitted to being good corporate citizens, 
bringing positive value to the communities we 
operate in. A key part of this commitment involves 
paying taxes where they are due and subscribing to 
fair taxation.
We believe it is vital to operate a fair, transparent and 
straightforward Tax Policy, which is required when 
running a sustainable business and delivering long-
term value to all our stakeholders. This is also 
reflected in the tax principles included in our 
Principles of Responsible Tax Behavior, as published 
on our website. The Flow Traders Tax Function will 
therefore provide applicable input as part of the 
approval process for business proposals to ensure a 
clear understanding of the tax consequences. 
Flow Traders also established a Tax Control 
Framework, members include the Board, Audit 
Committee, Finance department and Tax 
department. They are responsible for assessing and 
weighing the risks associated with the tax decision 
process for our business and stakeholders. Under this 
Tax Control Framework, significant tax positions, 
including the tax strategy, are shared with and 
subject to the approval of the Board. 
Flow Traders is prudent and transparent in respect of 
its financial reporting and its relations with tax 
authorities globally. Regarding financial reporting, 
conservative accounting principles are being applied 
and one-offs must occur infrequently and be clearly 
documented. 
We support transparency initiatives, such as Pillar II 
legislation and country-by-country reporting, and 
frequently assess the impact of such initiatives. We 
also closely monitor impact for Flow Traders, to 
ensure that we comply with local and international 
legislation and meet our reporting obligations. Where necessary or relevant, we take the appropriate 
actions to adopt these initiatives in our Tax Control 
Framework. We have good standing relationships 
with the tax authorities in each region in which we 
operate. We proactively manage our relationship 
with the tax authorities with the aim of minimizing 
the risk of challenge, dispute or damage that could 
have an impact on our credibility.
Flow Traders pays taxes where profits are earned in 
accordance with local and international tax 
legislation. We do not use tax haven jurisdictions for 
tax avoidance purposes and carry out our business 
through entities resident in jurisdictions where we 
factually operate our business. With this simple tax 
philosophy in place, the Company can operate its 
business in line with its belief that it is part of the 
corporate social responsibility duty to pay taxes 
where it operates. In addition to corporate income 
taxes, Flow Traders pays many other taxes, including 
but not limited to, payroll taxes and social security 
contributions on the wages of its employees, value 
added taxes and property taxes. All these taxes are a 
significant basis of funding governmental public 
services. It is our social responsibility to contribute 
through taxes in the regions we operate in.
