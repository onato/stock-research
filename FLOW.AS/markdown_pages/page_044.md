Onboarding
A positive onboarding experience is essential for  
building a sense of connection, ensuring a smooth  
transition, and enhancing retention. Our onboarding  
program is a two-week introduction designed to  
welcome new colleagues, immerse them in our  
purpose and values, and provide insight into how  
different parts of the business operate. It is also an 
opportunity for new hires to connect with others who 
are starting their journey with us. For those  
relocating to our offices from abroad, we provide  
comprehensive support to help them feel at home 
quickly.
Learning
To cultivate a culture that inspires innovation and risk 
awareness, we must ensure that our people have 
access to the right knowledge at the right time. That 
is why we established the Flow Academy, our in-
house learning and development center, designed to 
provide tailored training for our Technology, Trading, 
and Business Support teams.
For new graduates, we offer the Digital Assets Talent 
Program and an extensive Graduate Trading 
Program, both of which accelerate their learning 
curve and enhance their experience. These programs 
include continuous support from dedicated mentors, 
focus on technical expertise but also on personal 
development.
Given the collaborative and innovative nature of our 
business, most of our training occurs on the job. We 
champion the 70-20-10 approach to learning, where 
70% is gained through on-the-job experiences, 20% 
through coaching, and 10% through structured 
training courses. This approach ensures that our 
people are constantly learning, developing, and 
ready to drive our success forward .Growing
We empower our people to take charge of their  
personal development, pursue their career  
ambitions, and thrive by actively listening to their  
needs and offering personalized growth  
opportunities. Our success as an organization is  
intrinsically linked to the well-being and fulfillment of  
every individual on our team.
We also encourage our employees to explore  
rotational opportunities across different offices,  
allowing them to expand their horizons, collaborate  
with diverse teams, and enhance their capabilities. To  
foster continuous development, we offer a wide array  
of company-wide and tailored training opportunities. 
Leading
We operate in a world defined by volatility and 
complexity. To navigate these challenges, we need 
leaders who possess strong business acumen and 
excel in people leadership, embodying our Company 
values with authenticity. True leadership is about 
providing our people with a clear vision of where we 
are headed, inspiring them to contribute to our 
success and make a meaningful impact.
As we continue to evolve the need for clarity in roles 
and expectations becomes even more critical. Our 
leaders play a vital role in defining these expectations 
for their teams while also being transparent about 
their own responsibilities. We invest in our future 
leaders through targeted leadership programs and 
fast-tracking the careers of our most promising 
managers. These programs equip our managers with 
the skills and competencies needed to excel in their 
roles and lead with confidence.
Succession planning is a key part of our strategy, 
identifying top talent who have the potential to step 
into critical leadership roles in the future. This ensures we are always prepared for the next section 
of our growth, with a pipeline of leaders ready to 
guide us forward.
Challenges we face
Across our business, we have implemented targeted 
programs that empower our people to take charge 
of their development and career aspirations while 
enabling leaders to guide our growth. We have 
succeeded in creating a positive work environment 
where employees feel valued, and strong cross-team 
collaboration is the norm. However, despite these 
achievements, we still can make improvements in 
several key areas.
We see enhancing the employee experience as a 
continuous journey, evolving along the changing 
needs of our people and society. Each year, we 
carefully review the results of our employee 
engagement survey to identify key areas for further 
improvement, ensuring we remain committed to 
fostering a workplace where every employee feels 
supported and motivated to thrive.
Our workforce is vibrant and youthful, with many 
joining us early in their careers and experiencing 
rapid growth. This steep learning curve is both an 
opportunity and a challenge, as a portion of our 
leaders in management positions are young and still 
gaining experience. 
Secondly, retaining the dynamic group of young 
professionals is crucial, as we have observed higher 
attrition rates among our newest hires. 
Thirdly, while we successfully recruit and hire the 
talent we need, the labor market for science, 
technology, engineering and math (STEM) 
professionals remains highly competitive,  
particularly when it comes to attracting female talent 
in our core departments of Trading and Technology.
