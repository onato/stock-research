Asset class developments  
Equity
We still see significant opportunities for growth in 
the equity ETP market. Global equity ETP value 
traded increased to €23,928 billion in 2024, 
compared to €22,718 billion in 2023, and further 
market growth is expected from the increasing 
investor demand and awareness for ETPs. 
Flow Traders' equity value traded (ETPs, futures and 
cash) amounted to €3,217 billion in 2024, compared 
to €3,009 billion in 2023. Our strengths and future 
focus relating to equity includes: 
▪Strong performance globally in international ETPs 
and index futures 
▪Leveraging our global pricing capabilities in APAC 
as we penetrate and unlock new growth markets 
Fixed income 
Electronic trading in fixed income has increased 
dramatically over the last few years. For example, 
50% of Euro-denominated investment-grade (IG) 
credit is now executed electronically, reaching 75% 
on a ticket-count basis. This increase has contributed 
to the approaching inflection point in the 
electronification of credit markets. This is similar to 
what we have witnessed in other asset classes, such 
as FX, U.S. equity options and Exchange Traded 
Funds (ETFs). This transition is being driven by better 
pre- and post-trade information, the rise of 
algorithmic trading and new trading protocols being 
embraced by the buy- and sell-side. Initially driven by 
regulation such as MiFID II, it is likely that the 
regulatory landscape will continue to accelerate this 
electronification trend. Responding to these market dynamics, Flow Traders 
has built a strong fixed income liquidity provision 
capability set spanning ETPs, corporate credit 
(investment-grade and high yield bonds) and 
emerging market sovereigns. 
There has been a consistent increase in fixed income 
ETP value traded in recent years as well as AuM. The 
global fixed income ETP value traded increased to 
€2,901 trillion in 2024, compared to €2,836 trillion in 
2023. Flow Traders fixed income value traded (ETPs, 
Futures and Cash) amounted to €943 billion in 2024, 
compared to €1,154 billion in 2023, as we shifted 
more of our limited trading capital base to other 
asset classes which saw greater dislocations over the 
year. Nevertheless, we continue to deepen and 
broaden our market coverage and relationships with 
our buy-side counterparties. From a strategic 
standpoint, our focus areas include:
▪ETP ecosystem: Partner with issuers to develop 
innovative fixed income products. We are also 
seeking creation-redemption synergies with 
corporate bond market making
▪Credit trading: We will increase quote sizes to 
undertake larger block transactions with 
counterparties as well as distributing pre-trade 
portfolio trading levels to expedite portfolio 
construction
▪Model pricing: Expand model trading capabilities 
to new fixed income subsets and improve pricing 
and coverage of investment-grade bonds
Currency, cryptocurrency and commodity 
In recent years, cryptocurrencies have emerged as an 
important asset class with increased institutional 
acceptance. Cryptocurrencies saw a resurgence in 
2024 after the last crypto winter in 2022-23, with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 
2024 paving the way for increased institutional 
adoption. Trading volumes in cryptocurrencies more 
than doubled in 2024 compared to 2023, while global 
crypto ETP value traded increased more than ten-
fold on the back of the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals 
and launches in the U.S. as the development of 
institutional grade and regulated digital asset market 
infrastructure continued to progress. This comes on 
top of continued advancement in custody solutions, 
prime brokerage, data and analytics, AML-KYC and 
other risk solutions, digital property rights, digital 
identity solutions as well as decentralized finance 
ecosystems. 
Flow Traders’ crypto liquidity provision commenced 
more than eight years ago and spans OTC spot as 
well as ETPs. We are connected to over 20 trading 
venues globally and provide liquidity to over 200 
cryptocurrencies. From an ETP perspective, Flow 
Traders is the number one liquidity provider in crypto 
ETPs in Europe and a leader globally on-exchange. 
The digital assets space is well-suited to Flow Traders’ 
technology-enabled capabilities. The future focus 
and opportunities for the digital asset space includes:
▪ETPs: Maintain our leading position in crypto ETP 
market making with the prospect of further 
regional expansion while at the same time 
working to increase efficiency of access across the 
ecosystem
▪Spot and derivatives: Continue to grow our 
market making activities across these products by 
expanding our platform and token coverage 
▪Strategic partnerships: Leverage new and existing 
partnerships to further build out the trading 
infrastructure around digital assets
▪Utilize Flow Traders Strategic Capital: To further 
integrate Flow Traders into the growing 
ecosystem
