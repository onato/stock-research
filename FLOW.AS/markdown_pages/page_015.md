Our role in the ETP ecosystem
As a global liquidity provider we operate between both the primary and secondary markets. By providing continuous liquidity, we play a  crucial role in ensuring that ETPs 
and other financial instruments can be traded efficiently. This reduces trading costs and improves overall market accessibility for market participants.  
The securities market is accessible to registered participants, including broker-dealers and market makers. Investors place orders with broker-dealers, who route them to 
exchanges or market makers for execution. As a market maker, we provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices, facilitating trades with counterparties. Once a trade is 
confirmed, clearing houses handle the settlement, ensuring secure transfer of assets and payments. Acting as a liquidity provider, we maintain a market-neutral position, 
with performance unaffected by market price direction.
