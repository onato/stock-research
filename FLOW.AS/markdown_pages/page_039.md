Environmental footprint
We believe that everyone should contribute to 
reducing their Greenhouse gases (GHG) footprint 
and that all efforts, no matter how small, brings us 
closer to a sustainable and thriving planet. 
Establishing environmental footprint priorities with 
clear and achievable objectives is a critical step 
towards a sustainable future.
Our environmental p riorities
We are committed to supporting the global 
transition toward a sustainable, climate-neutral 
economy by m inimizing our environmental impact. 
To this end, we are committed to reducing the 
environmental footprint of our business operations.
Our business activities do not involve manufacturing, 
so our GHG footprint is relatively low. Most of our 
electricity consumption is tied to office operations, 
including lighting, temperature control, and 
electronic devices. In terms of carbon footprint, we 
identify three impact areas:
▪The indirect scope 2 GHG emissions from the 
electricity consumption in our offices
▪The indirect scope 3 GHG emissions from business 
travel (cat. 6) and employee commute (cat. 7)
▪The indirect scope 3 GHG emissions from our data 
center services suppliers (cat. 1) 
Our direct scope 1 GHG emissions from fossil fuels are 
minimal. Our office buildings use electricity for 
heating. Our focus begins with what we can directly 
control: decarbonizing our own operations. Looking 
ahead, climate action will be essential for partnering 
with high-value, reputable chains, making a well-
defined strategy with realistic objectives crucial to 
our ambition.Challenges we face
Our operations span ten locations across three 
continents, EMEA, APAC, and the Americas, with key 
hubs in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and New York. 
Additionally, we operate branch offices in London, 
Cluj, Milan, Paris, Shanghai, Singapore, and Chicago. 
When it comes to the environmental GHG footprint 
of our operations, the majority of our impact comes 
from our three largest offices (Amsterdam, Hong 
Kong and New York), which house approximately 
90% of our workforce. In developing our environment 
priorities, we encountered two key challenges:
▪Regional discrepancies in environmental 
reporting: In Europe, environmental reporting has 
been a focus for many years, gaining even more 
attention with the CSRD legislation. However, in 
other regions, we encounter varying levels of 
maturity in CO 2 measurement and reporting
▪Access to renewable energy: The availability of 
renewable energy differs greatly across our 
regions
These challenges highlight the complexity of 
reporting and the reduction of our emissions due to 
our reliance on third-parties, yet they drive us to find 
innovative solutions as we work towards a more 
sustainable future.Climate change transition plan
We conducted a resilience analysis in 2024. We are 
committed to supporting the transition to a low-
carbon economy by reducing our environmental 
footprint and enhancing climate resilience. Key 
elements of our transition plan includes:
▪Renewable energy adoption: We are working with 
landlords to transition to 100% renewable 
electricity, reducing the carbon footprint in our 
offices in Amsterdam, New York and Hong Kong
▪GHG emissions reduction: We aim to reduce 
scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by 2030, primarily 
through phasing out fossil fuel company car and 
enhancing energy efficiency in our office 
operations
▪GHG emission reduction: Our objectives for our 
data centers are to increase our share of 
renewable energy at each location
▪Climate risk assessment: Through climate 
scenario analysis, we evaluate physical and 
transition risks to our operations
▪Stakeholder engagement: We collaborate with 
key stakeholders to drive sustainability initiatives, 
integrating climate considerations into decision-
making
Policies related to environmental footprint 
While we have not yet formalized a dedicated 
environmental policy, we are actively implementing 
climate-related actions to reduce our environmental 
footprint.
