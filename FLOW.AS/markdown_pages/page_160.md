From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine the key 
audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.
