Europe consists of activities in the Netherlands with institutional trading 
activities in France, UK, Italy, trading activities in Jersey and internal IT activities 
in Romania. Americas consists of the subsidiaries in the USA. Asia contains our 
subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore and a Chinese representative office in 
Shanghai. The executive directors of the Board consider this segmentation to be 
relevant to understand the Group financial performance because it allows 
investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate 
the operating performance and decision making about allocation of resources 
and trading capital.
The Group measures results on an IFRS basis and reconciles the total segment 
results on net trading income, profit before tax and net profit. Significant 
transactions and balances between geographic regions occur primarily as result 
of Group operating companies incurring the operating expenses such as 
employee compensation, communication, software development and data  
processing and overhead costs for the purpose of providing services to affiliated 
operating companies (line items intercompany recharge income and expenses).
a)Restatement of prior period operating segments disclosure
On review of intercompany recharges, it was concluded that certain 
arrangements were accounted for incorrectly in 2023. As a result, the Group 
evaluated the presentation of its inter-company recharge arrangements in the 
Segment Report tables and have restated the disclosure as of 31 December 2023 
to enhance the understanding of the users of the financial statements of 
reported segmental results. The resulting differences between the restated 
presentation and the previously disclosed presentation are disclosed below. 
The aforementioned changes had no impact on the overall financial position or 
net earnings of the Group.
Additionally, total assets and total liabilities as of 31 December 2023 have been 
restated in-line with the prior period error disclosed in Note 4. The impact to total 
assets and total liabilities was a reduction of € 2.3 billion.Segment reporting For the year ended 31 December 2024
