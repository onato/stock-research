NATURE OF BUSINESS
Kraken Robotics Inc. (formerly Kraken Sonar Inc.) was incorporated on May 14, 2008 under the Business Corporations Act,
British Columbia, is a publicly traded company, and its registered office is at 100 King Street West, #1600, Toronto, Ontario,
M5X 1G5.
The Company’s principal business is the design, manufacture and sale of software centric sensors, batteries, and underwater
robotic systems.
Company Overview

Kraken Robotics Inc. (PNG: TSX-V) is a marine technology company supplying advanced sonar and optical sensors, batteries,
and underwater robotics equipment for military and commercial applications. The Company is recognized as world leading
innovators of Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) - a revolutionary underwater imaging technology that dramatically improves
seabed surveys by providing ultra-high resolution imagery at superior coverage rates. Both military and commercial markets
are showing encouraging growth as they are now incorporating unmanned vehicles and intelligent sensors in their
procurement plans and budgets.

AQUAPIX® MINSAS SENSOR FOR UNDERWATER VEHICLES
The AquaPix® MINSAS (Miniature Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Sonar) sensor is based upon Kraken’s core Synthetic
Aperture Sonar technology. The MINSAS compact receiver array length of only 60cm recently improved the AquaPix® SAS
image resolution from 3.0 x 3.3 cm (across along track) to an industry-leading 1.9 x 2.1 cm while maintaining a constant Ultra
HD resolution across ranges up to 120M per side. The lightweight array is integrated into a modular payload section of less
than eight-inch diameter, which can be easily mobilized in customers’ Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) of all sizes.
The MINSAS payload section also includes Kraken’s latest generation Real Time SAS Processor, the RTSAS MK-II. The RTSAS
enables real-time, onboard processing of SAS imagery and bathymetry at full resolution and allows operators to leverage
Kraken’s suite of post-processing tools, including the newly developed SASView 3D sonar visualization and control software.
The MINSAS plus RTSAS provides operators with an area coverage rate of higher than 3km2 per hour at full SAS resolution,
enabling highly efficient survey operations. Development continues our new Multispectral SAS product, this product will
provide a unique capability, enabling simultaneous ultra-high-resolution acoustic imagery and buried object detection from
the same sensor.

SEAVISION® 3D LASER SYSTEM FOR UNDERWATER VEHICLES
Kraken Robotik GmbH (“KRG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, commenced operations in January 2017 in
Bremen, Germany. Its focus is the development of 3D imaging sensors, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms for underwater robotic platforms.


                                                              2
KRG, with support from Kraken engineers in Canada, has developed the SeaVision® 3D laser system. SeaVision® is the world's
first RGB underwater laser imaging system that offers the resolution, range and scan rate to deliver dense full colour 3D
point cloud images of subsea infrastructure with millimeter accuracy, in real time. The ability to generate accurate 3D
reconstruction of underwater infrastructure is an important requirement for commercial, military and ocean research
applications. The initial system is designed for deployment on underwater robotic platforms such as Remotely Operated
Vehicles (ROVs) and AUVs. Kraken has seen significant interest in SeaVision® from customers across many industries from
defense to oil and gas, to renewable energy and nuclear.
In collaboration with an international oil and gas company, Kraken’s development of a unique, non-contact mooring chain
inspection tool continues, with commercialization scheduled for the second half 2021. This tool, utilizing SeaVision® platform
can be used to support existing offshore oil and gas inspection requirements, as well as upcoming offshore wind inspection
requirements. This new platform is anticipated to significantly reduce the cost of inspecting critical infrastructure, which
must be inspected regularly.
Kraken continues development of its SeaVision® laser profiler product which can be integrated on AUVs and tow bodies from
Kraken and other manufacturers.

KATFISH™ TOWED UNDERWATER VEHICLE
Kraken has developed the Kraken Active Towed Fish (KATFISH™) for high speed, high resolution seabed mapping. The
system enables real-time seabed imagery, bathymetry and advanced 3D digital terrain models of the seabed – optimized for
both manned and unmanned surface vessels. Coupled with Kraken’s revolutionary AquaPix® MINSAS, it is especially well-
suited for both military and commercial seabed surveys.
In the commercial seabed survey market, KATFISH™ offers offshore energy companies the advantage of comprehensive,
high-resolution surveys of existing infrastructure, such as pipelines and subsea stations, completed in at least half the time as
more conventional methods. KATFISH™ operates at speeds up to 10 knots, versus the slow moving 1-2 knots of ROV or the
medium 3-4 knots of the passively stable sonar systems, thus reducing operating time and cost.
In the defence market, there is a growing global requirement for modernization of mine countermeasure (MCM) solutions.
The previous generation of single-role mine hunting vessels designed and built between the 1970's - 1990's are now being
withdrawn from service. This leaves a growing requirement for high resolution, high speed seabed imaging platforms.
The ability of the KATFISH™ platform to generate centimetre-scale sonar resolution in all three dimensions can provide
significant improvement in the detection, classification and identification of small seabed objects for both military and
commercial seabed survey missions.
Kraken has high expectations for the KATFISH™ which provides high performance underwater mapping and mine hunting
capabilities from a towed platform for both the military and commercial markets and expects it to be a key revenue driver
for the Company. The Company has in the past and will in the future partner as a supplier to large defense contractors who
are involved in various multi-unit bids.
Recent updates and developments with KATFISH™ include:
    •    In September 2020, Kraken secured a contract through a competitive bid process with the Danish Ministry of
         Defence, Acquisition and Logistics Organization to supply mine-hunting sonar equipment to the Royal Danish Navy.
         Under the program, Kraken will provide its mine-hunting KATFISH™ towed SAS system, the Tentacle® Winch system,
         and Autonomous Launch and Recovery System (“ALARS”) to be integrated onboard the Royal Danish Navy’s
         optionally unmanned surface vessels. The aggregate value of the contract is $36 million, deliverable over a 5-to-10-
         year period, with the majority of funds (approximately $22 million) to be received over the two-to-three-year
         product acquisition phase, with the remaining funds (approximately $14 million) being allocated to post sales
         service arrangements which will continue for the duration of the remaining term.
    •    In September 2020, Kraken signed a contract for supply of mine-hunting systems to Remontowa Shipbuilding S.A.,
         to be integrated on the Polish Navy’s new KORMORAN II CounterMeasure (MCMV) vessels. It is expected that the
         equipment will be delivered during the second half of 2021.




                                                               3
THUNDERFISH® AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE (AUV)

Kraken continues its ThunderFish® AUV development program. Kraken’s original ThunderFish® AUV prototype is a technical
upgrade of Fraunhofer’s DeDave AUV. Kraken will pay Fraunhofer a royalty based on a percentage of each sale with
minimum commitments starting in 2022. The ThunderFish® AUV was designed for deep sea military, commercial and
scientific applications for use as a sensor and robotics technology demonstration platform to support ongoing development
of the Company’s underwater sensor and robotics programs.

Kraken has established a long-term technical co-operation program with Fraunhofer for technologies that can be deployed in
Kraken’s ThunderFish® AUV program. While Kraken is committed to grant research and development projects to Fraunhofer
of €300,000 per year for a period of three years (2019-2021), these projects will be awarded to Fraunhofer as various
statement of works are agreed upon and purchase orders issued. The remaining commitment under this program is
€300,000. These projects will be expensed as incurred.

As a result of funding included in Kraken’s OceanVision project, in Q3 2020 Kraken kicked off development of a ThunderFish®
XL.

Building from the previous development efforts of the ThunderFish® Alpha AUV, the ThunderFish® XL AUV is being designed
to be larger with an increased depth rating, larger payload capacity and longer mission endurance. It is being developed with
the following key capabilities:

    1.   The ability to transition from high-speed survey mode to “zero” speed hovering mode in-mission;

    2.   Through-the sensor acoustic, laser and optical target detection, image recognition and inspection; and,

    3.   Using onboard sensors to improve vehicle navigational accuracy.

In the AUV space, Kraken is focused on using the ThunderFish® XL AUVs and procured AUVs to build a fleet of vehicles
capable of providing Robotics as a Service rather than having a primary focus on selling AUVs. We expect that this will
provide Kraken with a unique and valuable market position. The ThunderFish® XL AUV is expected to be in service in 2022
with R&D costs (excluding monies paid to Fraunhofer) being part of the OceanVision™ project.

AUTONOMOUS LAUNCH AND RECOVERY SYSTEMS (ALARS)

Launch and recovery of equipment offshore is one of the most dangerous phases of any ROV or AUV operation. Through the
hiring of former Rolls Royce Marine employees in 2016, Kraken’s Handling Systems Division has an experienced LARS
engineering team with a proven track record. This group is developing both an intelligent winch system (TENTACLE™ and an
autonomous LARS system that can launch AUVS from vessels, host facilities and docking stations. This group’s capabilities
are integral to various customer opportunities that Kraken is involved in or pursuing.

During 2020, as part of the OceanVision™ project, Kraken completed successful sea testing of the Kraken’s ALARS, Tentacle
Winch® and, the KATFISH™ towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar underwater vehicle. Both the Tentacle Winch® and the ALARS
are constructed of non-welded aluminum for high strength, low weight, and low magnetic signature.

KRAKEN POWER GMBH

Effective December 31, 2019, Kraken owns a 100% of Kraken Power GmbH. Kraken Power GmbH designs and manufactures
unique pressure tolerant thrusters, drives, batteries, battery management systems, and electronics. These are specialized
deep-sea components for AUVs and ROVs. Kraken Power’s unique pressure tolerant gel encapsulation technology for lithium
polymer batteries provides an attractively priced, eco-friendly and superior alternative to oil compensated batteries
currently used for subsea battery applications. Kraken Power’s technology and products enable a significant reduction in bill
of material costs for our ThunderFish® AUV over acquiring conventional batteries.

On December 31, 2019 Kraken acquired the remaining 25% of Kraken Power not currently owned for €350,000, consisting of
€250,000 in cash and the issuance of 236,258 common shares of the Company at $0.62 per share. The transaction triggered


                                                              4
a change of control payment to an arm’s length third-party lender to Kraken Power in an amount equal to €120,000 which
was paid in Q3 2020. The purchase price has been reflected in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity while the
change in control payment was recognized on the income statement in Q4 2019.

During Q1 2021, Kraken Power delivered its third order of batteries to a military customer.

ACOUSTIC SIGNAL PROCESSING GROUP (ASPG)
Kraken’s Acoustic Signal Processing Group (ASPG) was established in mid 2018 and its employees have 80+ years of
combined experience in sonar systems development and integration. Their core competency is implementation of digital
signal processing and user interface software for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) sonar applications. This work frequently
involves integration with embedded processing platforms for shipboard or shore-based analysis systems. The group can
process and display data from fixed and mobile underwater as well as airborne systems to take advantage of machine
automation, active and passive array technology improvements, hardware and software upgrades of submarine, surface and
airborne ASW systems.

ROBOTICS AS A SERVICE (RaaS)
Kraken believes that certain customers would prefer to hire the company to provide product output (i.e. imaging and
bathymetry data) to them using the Kraken’s own equipment, rather than the customer buying the equipment and having to
own and operate and maintain the equipment. This is the genesis of Kraken’s RaaS offering. Kraken expects RaaS to become
a growing part of its revenue mix over time. Kraken will provide RaaS services to customers using Kraken’s KATFISH™ towed
underwater vehicles and AUVs such as ThunderFish® XL and Dive-LD and innovative sensors like the SeaVision® 3D laser
system. While RaaS revenue is starting from a small base, Kraken is bidding on opportunities involving both shallow and
deeper water surveys with the KATFISH™,ThunderFish®, and Dive-LD as well as our SeaVision® 3D laser system.

OCEANVISON™ PROJECT
The Company’s OceanVision™ project is focused on the development of a RaaS offering for underwater seabed imagery and
mapping. The OceanVision™ project began in the second half of 2019, with the contract formally signed in January 2020.
OceanVision™ is a three-year, $18.8 million project focused on the development of new marine technologies and products to
enable an underwater robotics data acquisition and data analytics as a service business. This will be a turnkey service
solution for ultra-high definition seafloor imaging, mapping and analytics, including simultaneous acquisition of ocean
environmental and marine habitat data. It will result in an end-to-end digitalization solution offering advanced sensors,
robots and data analytics as a turnkey service solution for seafloor imaging and mapping. Rapid high-throughput data
analytics will make it possible to significantly reduce the cost of obtaining high resolution seafloor imaging and mapping
allowing end-users to make more informed operational decisions in real-time.
The new technologies Kraken will develop within the scope of the OceanVision™ project are currently unavailable in a fully
matured and tightly integrated offering in the commercial industry. The combination of a hovering-capable AUV with the
potential for subsea residency, and a cutting-edge suite of acoustic and optical sensors, is a powerful package. As Kraken is
the manufacturer of all the major vehicle components (i.e., sensors, batteries, propulsion system and software), it is Kraken’s
belief that its robotics platforms and services can be provided at a much lower overall cost than competing systems.
The project began in Q3 2019 and Kraken has deployed its sensors and unmanned underwater platforms to conduct ultra-
high-definition seabed imaging and mapping on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and other areas of Atlantic Canada as
part of the OceanVision™ project. To date, Kraken has completed three offshore campaigns under this project.
To fund the OceanVision project, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster will provide an investment of $6.3 million, while the balance
of the project of $12.5 million will be provided by government agencies, industry partners (Petroleum Research
Newfoundland and Labrador, Ocean Choice International, Nunavut Fisheries Association and NSP Maritime Link
Incorporated) and Kraken. Kraken’s commitment to the project is $4.4 million, of which $2.1 million remains outstanding at
March 31, 2021. Kraken’s commitment will be reduced if and when additional government and industry partners join the
project in the future.

FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS AWARDED
At March 31, 2021, Kraken had $2.3 million remaining in grant funding to be drawn down against research and development
activities. This excludes the remaining $5.8 million of funding to be received under the OceanVision™ project.
Significant components of this remaining funding are as follows:
In August 2019, the Company was awarded funding for the development of a mooring chain laser inspection sensor for use
in offshore oil and gas applications. Under the project, a total of $1.8 million in funding is being provided in cash and in-kind
services from Husky ($1.26M) and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, through the Innovation and Business
Investment Corporation ($540,000). The project cash component received by Kraken will be $720,000, of which $558,673
has been received.
In August 2020, the Company was awarded $2.9 million funding from the National Research Council of Canada Industrial
Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP). This funding is being used to support research and development of Kraken’s
Thunderfish® XL Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and is also part of Kraken’s OceanVision™ project of which
$912,989 has been received.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2021
The Company recorded revenues of $3,601,204 (2020 - $6,390,675) from progress revenue from the Danish Navy contract as
well as the sale of subsea batteries, decrease of 44% compared to the same period a year ago. Prior year revenue was driven
by the delivery of a KATFISH™, subsea batteries, the provision of software services and survey support work. The Company’s
revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis mainly due to the timing of orders, progress towards completion and
lead times on parts purchases. At March 31, 2021, the Company had contract liabilities of $7,628,217 (December 31, 2020 -
$8,761,477), which represent customer advances on product orders.
Cost of sales were lower than that of the prior year at $1,450,862 (2020 - $3,472,702). The decrease in cost of sales was due
to the cost associated with the manufacturing of a KATFISH™, subsea batteries and labour associated with providing service
revenue in the prior year. The Company realized gross profit of $2,150,342 (2020 – $2,917,973). Gross margin for the
quarter was 60%, as compared to 46% gross margin in the prior first quarter.
Administrative expenses in the quarter increased 7% to $1,633,157 compared to $1,520,759 in the prior year due to both an
increase in headcount and various administrative expenses such as rent and software subscriptions. At the end of March 31,
2021, Kraken employed 149 employees compared to 108 in the prior year. Other notable items in the Administrative
expense category include Accounting and legal $82,595 (2020 - $98,516) travel related costs of $13,511 (2020 - $89,798),
which decreased due to COVID related cancellations for business meetings, trade shows and conferences. Also included
were rent of $80,172 (2020 - $61,384), consulting fees of $67,640 (2000- $12,507) and software subscriptions $171,130


                                                              7
(2020 - $128,451) due to the implementation of a new ERP system. During the quarter, the Company realized a foreign
exchange loss of $2,984 (2020 foreign exchange loss - $54,825).
Depreciation in the quarter totalled $304,489 (2020 - $185,462) and increased due to a higher property and equipment base.
Amortization of intangible assets increased to $75,872 (2020- $72,357) due to changes in foreign exchange rate movements.
Research and development costs (“R&D”) in the quarter increased to $381,098 (2020 - $104,161), as a result of the timing of
expenditures on various R&D programs as well as the timing of government assistance and reimbursements from the Ocean
SuperCluster/funding partners which are netted against R&D.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company received government assistance, excluding the OceanVision
project, in the amount of $855,026 (2020 - $868,955). Government Assistance has been classified as a reduction to Cost of
Sales $68,271 (2019 - $Nil), Research & Development expense $682,555 (2020 – $$667,561) and Administrative expense
$104,200 (2020 - $Nil).
The financial statements reflect a cost reimbursement under Kraken’s OceanVision project, including $535,729 (2020 -
$618,462) in reimbursements from the Ocean SuperCluster and $247,485 (2020 - $230,081) in reimbursements by funding
partners. Assistance related to the OceanVision project has been classified as a reduction to Research & Development
expense of $449,482 (2020 – $314,903), Administrative expense $25,625 (2020 – $12,893), Cost of sales $Nil (2020 –
$14,352) and Construction in progress of $308,107 (2020 - $506,395).
Share-based compensation of $117,655 was recorded, representing the fair value of the options that vested during the three
months ended March 31, 2021. During the same period of the prior year, the Company recorded share-based compensation
of $235,358. The decrease over the prior year is a result of reduced options granted in 2020.
The Company recorded net loss of $604,356 and comprehensive loss of $689,056 for the quarter, as compared to a net
income of $727,937 and comprehensive income of $1,005,882 for the same period of prior year.

included proceeds of $151,867 received upon option exercises.
Overall, excluding the foreign exchange impact on cash, cash decreased by 3,870,929 as compared to a decrease of $83,116
during the prior year.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company is a relatively new company with limited operating history and, in addition to facing all of the competitive risks
in the underwater sonar and robotics sector it will face all the risks inherent in developing a business including: access to
capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and maintain customers and the ability to put in
place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized
     engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;




                                                              8
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that
     achieve market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely
     delivery of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems
     will be available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts
     could have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
Only those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should
carefully consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before
investing in the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the
Company currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of
these risks occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously
harmed and investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its
operations and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.
The Company's capital structure consists of shareholders' equity and long-term note payable. The Company makes
adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial position and performance. In order to
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback shares or pay dividends, issue new
debt and sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at March 31, 2021, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are summarized
below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at
the reporting date was:
                                                                    March 31, 2021                December 31, 2020

     Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash                   $     10,049,526                   $     13,982,491
     Trade and other receivables                                            2,618,267                          3,119,920
                                                                         $ 12,667,793                       $ 17,102,411



                                                                9
At March 31, 2021, 71% of the trade receivables balance was owing from 2 customers (2020 – 69% of the trade receivables
was owing from 2 customers). At March 31, 2021, the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $7,628,217 (2020–
$8,761,477).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and
stressed conditions. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $9,004,024 (December 31, 2020 -
$12,924,509) to settle current liabilities of $12,350,913 (December 31, 2020 - $14,696,183) of which contract liabilities make
up $7,628,217 (December 31, 2020 - $8,761,477). The company has an operating line of credit to cover short-term liquidity
needs in the amount of $1,500,000 and €500,000, at March 31, 2021 the company had $1,500,000 and €34,258 available.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates,
and commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At March 31, 2021, the Company held $9,004,024 in cash and cash equivalents, $1,045,502 in restricted cash and
          has drawn $688,259 against its operating line of credit. The drawn operating line of credit bears interest annually
          at 3.95%, payable monthly.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
          The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales, certain purchases, short-term and long-term
          obligations in USD, EUR, GBP and DKK. The Company does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in
          foreign exchange.

Fair Value:

    During the three months ended March 31, 2020, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified
    assets and liabilities. The following table presents the fair value and fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial
    instruments and excludes financial instruments measured at amortized cost that are short-term in nature. The carrying
    values of the Company’s financial instruments approximate their fair values except for long-term debt:

USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.



                                                               10
All of the Company’s significant accounting policies and estimates and judgments are included in Notes 2,3 and 4 of its
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as Note 2 to the interim financial
statements.
