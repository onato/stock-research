NATURE OF BUSINESS
Kraken Robotics Inc. (formerly Kraken Sonar Inc.) was incorporated on May 14, 2008 under the Business Corporations Act,
British Columbia, is a publicly traded company, and its registered office is at 100 King Street West, #1600, Toronto, Ontario,
M5X 1G5.
The Company’s principal business is the design, manufacture and sale of software centric sensors, batteries, and underwater
robotic systems.
Company Overview

Kraken Robotics Inc. (PNG: TSX-V) is a marine technology company supplying advanced sonar and optical sensors, batteries,
and underwater robotics equipment for military and commercial applications. The Company is recognized as world leading
innovators of Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) - a revolutionary underwater imaging technology that dramatically improves
seabed surveys by providing ultra-high resolution imagery at superior coverage rates. Both military and commercial markets
are showing encouraging growth as they are now incorporating unmanned vehicles and intelligent sensors in their
procurement plans and budgets. In July 2021, Kraken acquired PanGeo Subsea, a leading services company specializing in high-
resolution 3D acoustic imaging solutions for the sub-seabed. PanGeo with offices in Canada, the United States and the United
Kingdom is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Kraken.

SENSORS FOR UNDERWATER VEHICLES
SONAR
The AquaPix® MINSAS (Miniature Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Sonar) sensor is based upon Kraken’s core Synthetic
Aperture Sonar technology. The MINSAS compact receiver array length of only 60cm recently improved the AquaPix® SAS
image resolution from 3.0 x 3.3 cm (across along track) to an industry-leading 1.9 x 2.1 cm while maintaining a constant Ultra
HD resolution across ranges up to 120M per side. The lightweight array is integrated into a small modular payload section,
which can be easily mobilized in customers’ Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) of all sizes. The MINSAS includes a Real
Time SAS Processor and the combination with the lightweight array provides operators with a high area coverage rate at full
SAS resolution, enabling highly efficient survey operations. Development continues upon Kraken’s core Synthetic Aperture
Sonar technology. The MINSAS light weight receiver array recently reduced the weight by 40% while maintaining the AquaPix®
SAS image resolution of 3.0 x 3.3 cm. Development continues of our new Multispectral SAS product, this product will provide
a unique capability, enabling simultaneous ultra-high-resolution acoustic imagery and buried object detection from the same
sensor. While our SAS technologies are focused on the Mine Counter Measures (MCM) market, Kraken also has a core
competency in implementation of digital signal processing and user interface software for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)
sonar applications and is working on developments in passive array technologies for the ASW market.



                                                               2
OPTICAL
The SeaVision® 3D laser system is the world's first RGB underwater laser imaging system that offers the resolution, range and
scan rate to deliver dense full colour 3D point cloud images of subsea infrastructure with millimeter accuracy, in real time. The
ability to generate accurate 3D reconstruction of underwater infrastructure is an important requirement for commercial,
military and ocean research applications. The initial system is designed for deployment on underwater robotic platforms such
as Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and AUVs. Kraken continues to see significant interest in SeaVision® from customers
across many industries from defense, to offshore oil and gas and renewable energy. This interest has led to numerous pilots
and demonstrations with major energy players in North America, South America, and Europe. As this activity continues, Kraken
is focusing its efforts in building a subsea infrastructure inspection service offering.
Kraken’s development of a unique, non-contact mooring chain inspection tool continues with commercialization scheduled
for 2022. This tool, utilizing the SeaVision® platform can be used to support existing offshore oil and gas inspection
requirements, as well as upcoming offshore wind inspection requirements. This new platform is anticipated to significantly
reduce the cost of inspecting critical infrastructure, which must be inspected regularly.
Kraken continues development of its SeaVision® laser profiler product which can be integrated on AUVs and tow bodies from
Kraken and other manufacturers.

UNDERWATER VEHICLES

KATFISH™
Kraken has developed the Kraken Active Towed Fish (KATFISH™) for high speed, high resolution seabed mapping. The system
enables real-time seabed imagery, bathymetry and advanced 3D digital terrain models of the seabed – optimized for both
manned and unmanned surface vessels. Coupled with Kraken’s revolutionary AquaPix® MINSAS, it is especially well-suited for
both military and commercial seabed surveys.

KATFISH™ is tightly integrated an intelligent winch system (TENTACLE™) and an autonomous LARS system that can launch
AUVS from vessels, host facilities and docking stations. Both the Tentacle Winch® and the ALARS are constructed of non-
welded aluminum for high strength, low weight, and low magnetic signature.
In the commercial seabed survey market, KATFISH™ offers offshore energy companies the advantage of comprehensive, high-
resolution surveys of existing infrastructure, such as pipelines and subsea stations, completed in at least half the time as more
conventional methods. KATFISH™ operates at speeds up to 10 knots, versus the slow moving 1-2 knots of ROV or the medium
3-4 knots of the passively stable sonar systems, thus reducing operating time and cost.
In the defence market, there is a growing global requirement for modernization of mine countermeasure (MCM) solutions.
The previous generation of single-role mine hunting vessels designed and built between the 1970's - 1990's are now being
withdrawn from service. This leaves a growing requirement for high resolution, high speed seabed imaging platforms.
The ability of the KATFISH™ platform to generate centimetre-scale sonar resolution in all three dimensions can provide
significant improvement in the detection, classification and identification of small seabed objects for both military and
commercial seabed survey missions.
Kraken has high expectations for the KATFISH™ which provides high performance underwater mapping and mine hunting
capabilities from a towed platform for both the military and commercial markets and expects it to be a key revenue driver for
the Company. The Company has in the past and will in the future partner as a supplier to large defense contractors who are
involved in various multi-unit bids.
Recent updates and developments with KATFISH™ include:
    •     In September 2020, Kraken secured a contract through a competitive bid process with the Danish Ministry of Defence,
          Acquisition and Logistics Organization to supply mine-hunting sonar equipment to the Royal Danish Navy. Under the
          program, Kraken will provide its mine-hunting KATFISH™ towed SAS system, the Tentacle® Winch system, and
          Autonomous Launch and Recovery System (“ALARS”) to be integrated onboard the Royal Danish Navy’s optionally
          unmanned surface vessels. The aggregate value of the contract is $36 million, deliverable over a 5-to-10-year period,
          with the majority of funds (approximately $22 million) to be received over the two-to-three-year product acquisition


                                                               3
         phase, with the remaining funds (approximately $14 million) being allocated to post sales service arrangements which
         will continue for the duration of the remaining term.
    •    In September 2020, Kraken signed a contract for supply of mine-hunting systems to Remontowa Shipbuilding S.A., to
         be integrated on the Polish Navy’s new KORMORAN II CounterMeasure (MCMV) vessels. It is expected that the
         equipment will be delivered during the fourth quarter of 2021.

THUNDERFISH® AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE (AUV)

Kraken continues its ThunderFish® AUV development program. Kraken’s original ThunderFish® AUV prototype is a technical
upgrade of Fraunhofer’s DeDave AUV. Kraken will pay Fraunhofer a royalty based on a percentage of each sale with minimum
commitments starting in 2022. The ThunderFish® AUV was designed for deep sea military, commercial and scientific
applications for use as a sensor and robotics technology demonstration platform to support ongoing development of the
Company’s underwater sensor and robotics programs.

Kraken has established a long-term technical co-operation program with Fraunhofer for technologies that can be deployed in
Kraken’s ThunderFish® AUV program. While Kraken is committed to grant research and development projects to Fraunhofer
of €300,000 per year for a period of three years (2019-2021), these projects will be awarded to Fraunhofer as various
statement of works are agreed upon and purchase orders issued. The remaining commitment under this program is €7,053.
These projects will be expensed as incurred.

As a result of funding included in Kraken’s OceanVision project, in Q3 2020 Kraken kicked off development of a ThunderFish®
XL.

Building from the previous development efforts of the ThunderFish® Alpha AUV, the ThunderFish® XL AUV is being designed
to be larger with an increased depth rating, larger payload capacity and longer mission endurance. It is being developed with
the following key capabilities:

    1.   The ability to transition from high-speed survey mode to “zero” speed hovering mode in-mission;

    2.   Through-the sensor acoustic, laser and optical target detection, image recognition and inspection; and,

    3.   Using onboard sensors to improve vehicle navigational accuracy.

In the AUV space, Kraken is focused on using the ThunderFish® XL AUVs and procured AUVs to build a fleet of vehicles capable
of providing Robotics as a Service rather than having a primary focus on selling AUVs. We expect that this will provide Kraken
with a unique and valuable market position. The ThunderFish® XL AUV is expected to be in service in 2022 with R&D costs
(excluding monies paid to Fraunhofer) being part of the OceanVision™ project.

POWER SYSTEMS

Kraken designs and manufactures unique pressure tolerant thrusters, drives, batteries, battery management systems, and
electronics. These are specialized deep-sea components for AUVs and ROVs. Kraken’s unique pressure tolerant gel
encapsulation technology for lithium polymer batteries provides an attractively priced, eco-friendly and superior alternative
to oil compensated batteries currently used for subsea battery applications. Kraken’s technology and products enable a
significant reduction in bill of material costs for our ThunderFish® AUV over acquiring conventional batteries. During Q1 and
Q3 2021, Kraken delivered batteries to a military customer and will deliver additional orders to both defence and commercial
customers in Q4 2021.

ROBOTICS AS A SERVICE (RaaS)
Kraken believes that certain customers would prefer to hire the company to provide product output (i.e. imaging and
bathymetry data) to them using the Kraken’s own equipment, rather than the customer buying the equipment and having to
own and operate and maintain the equipment. This is the genesis of Kraken’s RaaS offering. Kraken expects RaaS to become
a growing part of its revenue mix over time. Kraken will provide RaaS services to customers using Kraken’s KATFISH™ towed
underwater vehicles and AUVs such as ThunderFish® XL and Dive-LD and innovative sensors like the SeaVision® 3D laser

                                                              4
system. While RaaS revenue is starting from a small base, Kraken is bidding on opportunities involving both shallow and deeper
water surveys with the KATFISH™,ThunderFish®, and Dive-LD as well as our SeaVision® 3D laser system. In July 2021 Kraken
was awarded a $0.6 million RaaS job to survey a subsea electric cable using the company’s KATFISH™ and ALARS survey
platform. Over the last 12 months, Kraken has been actively bidding on RaaS-type survey contracts and recently hired a Marine
Survey Manager to lead the efforts to grow this offering. In addition, Kraken expects RaaS growth to accelerate and expects
significant revenue synergies from its acquisition of PanGeo Subsea, which was completed in July 2021, subsequent to the
current quarter end.

PANGEO SUBSEA
On July 30, 2021 Kraken closed its acquisition of PGH Capital Inc. PGH Capital operates its business through its subsidiaries,
PanGeo Subsea Inc. and PanGeo Subsea Scotland Limited (collectively with PGH Capital, “PanGeo”). PanGeo was a private
Canadian services company specializing in high-resolution 3D acoustic imaging solutions for the sub-seabed with offices in St.
John’s, Newfoundland and Aberdeen, United Kingdom. PanGeo’s assets consist primarily of human capital, know-how and
equipment comprised mostly of sub bottom imaging units and acoustic imaging units that are used to provide sub-seabed
survey services.

The aggregate purchase price for PanGeo is up to $23 million comprised of the following:

    •    $3 million payable on closing;
    •    12,068,965 Common Shares having a value of $0.58 each and $7 million in the aggregate issued on closing;
    •    $4 million to be paid in cash, plus interest at a rate of 6% per annum, on the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
         by a non-transferable promissory notes; and
    •    Up to an aggregate of $9 million to be paid pursuant to an earn-out on the following terms:
             o an amount equal to 300% of the amount by which certain qualifying revenues in the one-year period
                  immediately following the Closing Date exceeds $9,500,000, up to a maximum payment of $4,500,000 (the
                  “First Earn-Out Amount”); and
             o the amount equal to 300% of the amount by which certain qualifying revenues in the two-year period
                  immediately following the Closing Date exceeds $21,500,000, up to a maximum payment of $4,500,000 less
                  any amount paid pursuant to the First Earn-Out Amount (the “Second Earn-Out Amount”, and together with
                  the First Earn-Out Amount, the “Earn-Out Amounts”).

The Earn-Out Amounts will be paid within thirty business days following the filing deadline date or the actual filling date on
SEDAR, whichever is the earliest, of Kraken’s quarterly financial statements for the quarter that includes first or second year
anniversary of the Closing Date, as the case may be. At Kraken’s option and, subject always to the approval of the TSX Venture
Exchange (the “TSXV”) at the time, payments required to be made in respect of the Earn-Out Amounts may be satisfied by way
of a cash payment equal to 50% of the Earn-Out Amount and the issuance of Common Shares having an aggregate value equal
to the remaining 50% of the Earn-Out Amount then due and payable.

The fair values shown in the financial statements for PanGeo are preliminary, pending finalization of certain assumptions used
in valuing the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and value of contingent consideration.

OCEANVISON™ PROJECT
The Company’s OceanVision™ project is focused on the development of a RaaS offering for underwater seabed imagery and
mapping. The OceanVision™ project began in the second half of 2019, with the contract formally signed in January 2020.
OceanVision™ is a three-year, $18.8 million project focused on the development of new marine technologies and products to
enable an underwater robotics data acquisition and data analytics as a service business. This will be a turnkey service solution
for ultra-high definition seafloor imaging, mapping and analytics, including simultaneous acquisition of ocean environmental
and marine habitat data. It will result in an end-to-end digitalization solution offering advanced sensors, robots and data
analytics as a turnkey service solution for seafloor imaging and mapping. Rapid high-throughput data analytics will make it
possible to significantly reduce the cost of obtaining high resolution seafloor imaging and mapping allowing end-users to make
more informed operational decisions in real-time.

                                                               5
The new technologies Kraken will develop within the scope of the OceanVision™ project are currently unavailable in a fully
matured and tightly integrated offering in the commercial industry. The combination of a hovering-capable AUV with the
potential for subsea residency, and a cutting-edge suite of acoustic and optical sensors, is a powerful package. As Kraken is the
manufacturer of all the major vehicle components (i.e., sensors, batteries, propulsion system and software), it is Kraken’s belief
that its robotics platforms and services can be provided at a much lower overall cost than competing systems.
The project began in Q3 2019 and Kraken has deployed its sensors and unmanned underwater platforms to conduct ultra-
high-definition seabed imaging and mapping on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and other areas of Atlantic Canada as part
of the OceanVision™ project. To date, Kraken has completed three offshore campaigns under this project.
To fund the OceanVision project, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster will provide an investment of $6.3 million, while the balance of
the project of $12.5 million will be provided by government agencies, industry partners (Petroleum Research Newfoundland
and Labrador, Nunavut Fisheries Association and NSP Maritime Link Incorporated) and Kraken. Kraken’s commitment to the
project is $4.7 million, of which $2.0 million remains outstanding at September 30, 2021. Kraken’s commitment will be reduced
if and when additional government and industry partners join the project in the future.

FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS AWARDED
At September 30, 2021, Kraken had $11.2 million remaining in grant funding to be drawn down against research and
development activities. This amount includes the $7.1 million in the recently announced Newfoundland Offshore Oil and Gas
Industry Recovery Assistance (OOGIRA). This excludes the remaining $3.7 million of funding to be received under the
OceanVision™ project.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2021
The Company recorded revenues of $5,060,517 (2020 - $1,545,463) in the quarter, an increase of 227% compared to the same
period a year ago. Revenue in the quarter related mainly to progress revenue from the Danish Navy contract, while the prior
year revenue was driven from the delivery of subsea batteries, the provision of software services and survey support work.
The Company’s revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis mainly due to the timing of orders, progress towards
completion and lead times on parts purchases. At September 30, 2021, the Company had contract liabilities of $6,658,249
(December 31, 2020 - $8,761,477), which represent customer advances on product orders for which the Company has not yet
met the criteria for revenue recognition.
Cost of sales were higher than that of the prior year at $3,114,287 (2020 - $741,777). The Company realized gross profit of
$1,946,230 (2020 – $803,686). Gross margin for the quarter were lower at 38%, as compared to 52% gross margin in the prior
year due to change in product mix in the current quarter.
Administrative expenses in the quarter increased 31% to $2,629,916 compared to $2,006,167 in the prior year due to the
addition of PanGeo as well as acquisition transaction costs of $568,026 (2020-nil). At the end of September 30, 2021, Kraken
employed 220 employees (50 employees from PanGeo) compared to 124 in the prior year. Other notable items in the
Administrative expense category include compensation costs of $1,076,924 (2020 - $1,095,692) due to increased headcount
and increased government assistance, accounting and legal $316,045 (2020 - $246,925). Also included were rent of $114,629
(2020 - $69,171), consulting fees of $111,755 (2020 - $72,361), software subscriptions of $234,717 (2020 - $152,241). During

Depreciation in the quarter totalled $660,817 (2020 - $186,960) and increased due to a higher property and equipment base
mainly attributed to acquisition of PanGeo. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $337,126 (2020- $75,242) due to
acquisition of PanGeo.
Research and development costs (“R&D”) in the quarter increased slightly to $583,304 (2020 - $527,781), as a result of the
timing of expenditures on various R&D programs as well as the timing of government assistance and reimbursements from
the Ocean SuperCluster/funding partners and CEWS, which are netted against R&D.
During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company received government assistance, excluding the OceanVision
project, in the amount of $1,219,575 (2020 - $1,322,687). Government Assistance has been classified as a reduction to Cost of
Sales $433,577 (2020 - $99,325), Research & Development expense $411,052 (2020 – $923,134) and Administrative expense
$374,946 (2020 - $300,228).

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company is a relatively new company with limited operating history and, in addition to facing all of the competitive risks
in the underwater sonar and robotics sector it will face all the risks inherent in developing a business including: access to
capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and maintain customers and the ability to put in
place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;



                                                                9
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.
The Company's capital structure consists of shareholders' equity, long-term obligations and contingent consideration. The
Company makes adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial position and
performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback shares or pay
dividends, issue new debt and sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at September 30, 2021, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are
summarized below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                September 30, 2021                December 31, 2020

      Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash                    $     5,076,479                  $     13,982,491
      Trade and other receivables                                            4,531,290                         3,119,920
                                                                           $ 9,607,769                      $ 17,102,411

At September 30, 2021, 60% of the trade receivables balance was owing from 3 customers (2020 – 69% of the trade receivables
was owing from 2 customers). At September 30, 2021, the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $6,658,249 (2020–
$8,761,477).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and
stressed conditions. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $1,725,896 (December 31, 2020 -
$12,924,509), cash that will become unrestricted on December 31, 2021 of $2,294,290 as well as accounts receivable of
$4,531,290 to settle current liabilities of $19,163,223 (December 31, 2020 - $14,696,183) of which contract liabilities make up
$6,658,249 (December 31, 2020 - $8,761,477). Associated with two large contracts, the Company will receive progress
payments of $4,469,948 in 2021 and $11,192,685 during 2022.



                                                               10
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At September 30, 2021, the Company held $1,725,896 in cash and cash equivalents, $3,350,583 in restricted cash,
          has drawn $341,094 against its operating line of credit at Kraken Power and has drawn $1,465,000 against its
          operating line of credit at PanGeo. The Kraken Power operating line of credit bears interest annually at 3.95%,
          payable monthly, which is a fixed interest rate and is not subject to interest rate risk and the PanGeo operating line
          of credit bears interest annually at the bank’s prime plus 2.5%.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
          The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales, certain purchases, short-term and long-term
          obligations in USD, EUR, GBP, DKK and BRL. The Company does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in
          foreign exchange.
Fair Value
The Company provides disclosure of the three-level hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the
fair value measurement. The three levels of fair value hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs are as follows:
Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data or other means.
Level 3: Inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
The Company does not record any asset or liability at fair value on an ongoing basis.
The carrying values of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, trade and other payables and bank indebtedness approximate
their fair values due to their short term to maturity.
The fair values of the long-term obligations and contingent consideration are estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation
technique. The fair value measurement for contingent consideration uses level 3 inputs based on estimates of future cash
flows associated with the liabilities and discount rates that reflect market assessments of the performance risk which includes
the credit risk of Company at September 30, 2021. The carrying value of the contingent consideration equals fair value as it is
categorized as fair value through profit and loss. The fair value of the long term debt is carried at amortized costs. For the fair
value of contingent consideration, reasonably possible changes at September 30, 2021 to the risk-adjusted discount rate of
1%, holding other inputs constant. An increase (decrease) in discount rate would have increased (decreased) the Company’s
net loss by approximately $98,438 and ($100,865) respectively.

USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.
All of the Company’s significant accounting policies and estimates and judgments are included in Notes 2,3 and 4 of its audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as Note 2 to the interim financial statements.
