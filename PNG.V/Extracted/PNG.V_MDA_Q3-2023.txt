                              MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2023
                              (Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated)

This Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Kraken Robotics Inc. (the “Company” or “Kraken”) provides analysis of
the Company’s financial results for the three and nine month period ending September 30, 2023 and should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2022,
which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. This MD&A is current as at November 24, 2023, the date of preparation.
The September 30, 2023 condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements. These
financial statements were prepared using the same accounting policies and methods of computation and are subject to the
same use of estimates and judgments, as the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2022, with the exception of revenue recognition as the Company changed its revenue recognition for its battery products from
point in time to over time using the input cost method. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not
include all disclosures required by IFRS for annual consolidated financial statements and accordingly should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 prepared in
accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). All amounts are expressed in
thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Consolidated revenue in Q3 2023 was $20,342 compared to $12,291 in Q3 2022, and $41,575 for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2023, compared to $32,095 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2022. Revenue in the quarter was
driven by the sale of the continued work on large orders received in Q4 2022 including SeaPowerTM subsea batteries, Remote
Minehunting and Disposal Systems (RMDS) to the Government of Canada and AquaPix® MINSAS sensors.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Q3 2023 was $4,423 (Q3 2022 – $1,745) with the increase related to the above noted projects as well
improved gross margin related to a change in revenue product mix in the quarter over the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA(1) for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 was $8,366 (2022 – $4,361) and also increased due to revenue volumes and
improved gross margin related to a change in product mix.

Net income for Q3 2023 was $2,301 (Q3 2022 – net loss of $928) or $0.01 per share compared to $(0.00) in the prior year. Net
income for the nine month period ending September 30, 2023 was $2,962 compared to net loss of $2,973 for the nine month
period ending September 30, 2022.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.

Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our AquaPix® MINSAS sensors, KATFISH™ systems, SeaPower™ subsea battery
systems and RMDS. Product revenue in Q3 2023 was $17,151 (Q3 2022 - $7,603) and increased 126% over the prior year due
to continued work on large orders recently received including SeaPower® subsea batteries, KATFISH™ system and RMDS.
Product revenue for the nine month period ending September 30, 2023 was $32,972 (2022- $19,820) an increase of 66% over
the prior year due to the sale of a KATFISH™ to a navy in the Asia-Pacific region and continued work on large orders received
in Q4 2022 including SeaPower® subsea batteries, sale of KATFISH™ system to a NATO country and RMDS.

Kraken’s service business consists of a robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our Sub-Bottom Imager™,
Acoustic Corer™, KATFISHTM, and SeaVision. Service revenue in Q3 2023 was $3,191 (Q3 2022- $4,688) a decrease of 32% over
the prior year due to a large Acoustic Corer™ project that occurred in 2022 which did not repeat in 2023. Service revenue in
the first nine months of 2023 decreased to $8,603 from $12,275 in the prior year due to the non-recurring Acoustic Corer™
project.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of the costs of material as well as the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged
in product and service activities. Cost of sales in the quarter were $10,347 (Q3 2022 - $7,862).. During Q3 2023, the Company
realized gross margin of $9,995 (Q3 2022 - $4,429) resulting in a gross margin percentage of 49% compared to 36% in Q3 2022.
The increase in gross margin percentage reflects a change in product and service revenue mix in the current quarter to higher
margin business compared to the prior year.

                 case with no standard meaning under IFRS, and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed
                 by other issuers. Refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” section of this MD&A.
Cost of sales for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 were $19,333 (2022 - $19,451). As a result, gross margin
in Q3 2023 increased to $22,242 (2022 - $12,644). Gross margin percentage year-to-date was 54% compared to 39% in the
prior year due to change of revenue mix in 2023 compared to 2022 with higher margins compared to the prior year.

Administration Expenses
Administration expenses in Q3 2023 increased 76% to $5,331 (Q3 2022 - $3,032) due to costs associated with growing our
business. Administration expenses include transaction and restructuring costs for Q3 2023 of $882 (Q3 2022 -$442) related to
the acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services as well as increasing efficiency in operations.
Notable items in the administration expenses excluding transaction and restructuring costs by category include: salaries and
benefits expenses which increased 60% to $3,307 (Q3 2022 - $2,063), travel related costs which increased to $474 (Q3 2022 -
$363) due to increased global travel, software subscriptions which increased to $375 (Q3 2022 - $249), accounting and legal
which increased to $305 (Q3 2022 - $84), and office and shop supplies of $204 (Q3 2022 - $172).
Administration expenses for the nine months excluding transaction and restructuring costs increased by 49% to $11,682 (2022
- $7,831) due to the increased activity across the Company. Year-to-date transaction and restructuring costs were $1,132
compared to $646 in the prior year. At the end of September 2023, Kraken employed 240 employees compared to 211 in the
prior year resulting in higher salaries and benefits. Notable items in the administration expense category include: salaries and
benefits, excluding restructuring costs, which increased to $5,792 (2022 - $4,182) due to decreased government assistance,
travel related costs of $1,513 (2022 - $814) and advertising and tradeshows of $347 (2022 - $187) which increased due to
global travel, software subscriptions of $991 (2022 - $684), accounting and legal costs which increased to $792 (2022- $521)
and office and shop supplies of $672 (2022 - $504).
Research and Development costs
Research and development (R&D) costs in the quarter increased to $1,272 (Q3 2022 - $94), due to the timing of expenditures
on various R&D programs as well as the timing of government assistance which are netted against R&D. Year-to-date, R&D
costs increased to $3,139 (2022 - $1,086) resulting from the timing of expenditures on various R&D programs and government
assistance. Investment tax credits were $149 (2022 - $nil) in the quarter and $945, year-to-date (2022 - $634).
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation in the quarter totalled $864 (Q3 2022 - $753), while amortization of intangible assets decreased to $345 (Q3
2022 - $393). Year-to-date, depreciation increased to $2,585 (2022 - $2,271) while amortization of intangible assets decreased
to $1,119 (2022 - $1,162).
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation expense in Q3 2023 was $61 (Q3 2022 - $137), representing the fair value of the options recognised
over the vesting period of the underlying options during the quarter. Year-to-date share-based compensation was $320 (2022
- $619).
Financing Costs

Financing costs in Q3 2023 were $291 (Q3 2022 - $847) and year-to-date financing costs were $1,262 (2022 - $2,445). Both the
quarter and year-to-date amounts declined due to the reduced number of bank guarantees and lower fair value adjustments
on debt and contingent consideration associated with the PanGeo acquisition.

Impairment of goodwill

During Q2 2023, the Company completed a goodwill impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the CGU was
determined to be higher than its recoverable amount of $18,765 and an impairment loss of $2,757 (2022 – nil) was recognized.
The impairment loss was allocated fully to goodwill, reducing the goodwill included in the Services segment to $4,120. The
recoverable amount of the CGU was based on its value in use determined by discounting the future cash flows to be generated
from continuing use of the CGU. The value in use as at June 30, 2023 was determined similarly to the December 31, 2022
goodwill impairment test and was based on WACC of 19%, terminal growth rate of 2% and an average estimated compounded
growth rate of 4% from 2024 to 2027.
During the period ended September 30, 2023 the Company assessed for further indicators of impairment and determined
there were none at this time.
Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA(1)

Net income in the quarter was $2,301 and comprehensive net income was $2,499, as compared to net loss of $928 and
comprehensive net loss of $1,258 for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Q3 2023 was $4,423 (Q3-2022 -
$1,745) or a 22% Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) compared to a 14% Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) for the same period a year ago. The
change over the prior period was due to the increase in revenue and gross margin for the company year over year.
Year-to-date, the Company recorded net income of $2,962 and comprehensive income of $3,124 compared to a loss of $2,973
and comprehensive loss of $3,282 for the same period of the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the nine month period was $8,366 or 20% Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) compared to an adjusted EBITDA(1)
of $4,361 or 14% in the prior year. The increase is from a change in product mix with higher margins year over year.

             1.    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-IFRS ratio, in each
                   case with no standard meaning under IFRS, and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed
                   by other issuers. Refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” section of this MD&A.
A commercial bank issued standby letters of credit on behalf of the Company to customers in the amount of US$3,108
(C$4,221), US$1,960 (C$2,662) and US$830 (C$1,127) on advance guarantees secured by Export Development Canada. The

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company is a relatively new company with limited operating history and, in addition to facing all of the competitive risks
in the underwater sonar and robotics sector it will face all the risks inherent in developing a business including: access to
capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and maintain customers and the ability to put in
place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

The geopolitical risk currently being experienced may cause continued economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company experienced minor delays in procuring components and conducting sea trials.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities and long-term obligations. The Company will
make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial position and performance. In order
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback shares or pay dividends, issue debt
or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at September 30, 2023, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are
summarized below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                       September 30, 2023          December 31, 2022
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                       $     791                $     8,265
 Trade and other receivables                                                       10,973                     12,221
 Contract assets                                                                     6,532                      4,347
                                                                                $ 18,296                   $ 24,833


At September 30, 2023, 78% of the trade receivables balance was owing from two customers (Q3 2022 – 60% of the trade
receivables balance was owing from two customers). At September 30, 2023 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of
$14,502 (2022 – $11,817).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had a cash
balance of $791 (December 31, 2022 - $8,265). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent on
the Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations with
payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to generate
sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At September 30, 2023, the Company held $791 in cash and has drawn $5,957, $301 and $1,500 against its operating
          lines of credit. The drawn operating line of credit bears interest annually at bank prime plus 2.5%, 3.95% and bank
          prime plus 2.5% respectively, payable monthly.
          The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit balance.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:
                                                                               September 30, 2023           December 31, 2022
      Financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency:
         Trade and other payables USD                                                          4,141                    $     581
         Trade and other payables GBP                                                            888                        1,381

      Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
         Trade and other receivables USD                                                         826                        4,697

         Trade and other receivables EUR                                                         821                          473
         Trade and other receivables DKK                                                           8                            6

    For the period ended September 30, 2023, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in the
    exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
    would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net loss by approximately $1,067 (2022 - $13).


Fair Value:
     During the period ended September 30, 2023, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified assets
     and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate the carrying
     amounts.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.

Subsequent events:
     Subsequent to September 30, 2023, the Company:
     (a) Granted 400,000 stock options to a Director at an exercise price of $0.495.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA margin, gross margin and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial measures and non-
IFRS ratios, when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to
evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do not have any
standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by
other companies. This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined at Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
