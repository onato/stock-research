SUMMARY OF KEY 2022 DEVELOPMENTS
        In 2022 Kraken continued to deliver on its contract to the Danish Ministry of Defence, Acquisition and Logistics
         Organization (DALO) to supply mine-hunting sonar equipment to the Royal Danish Navy. Under this contract awarded
         in September 2020, Kraken has been providing its mine-hunting KATFISH™ towed SAS system, the Tentacle® Winch
         system, and Autonomous Launch and Recovery System (ALARS) to be integrated onboard the Royal Danish Navy’s
         optionally unmanned surface vessels. The aggregate value of the contract is $36 million, deliverable over a 5-to-10-
         year period, with the majority of funds (approximately $22 million) to be received over the two-to-three-year product
         acquisition phase, with the remaining funds (approximately $14 million) being allocated to post sales service
         arrangements which will continue for the duration of the remaining term. At the end of 2022, the acquisition phase
        of this project was largely delivered with integration and sea acceptance testing to be completed on various
        components in 2023. The sustainment portion of the contract begins during 2023.
       In March 2022, Kraken announced it had been awarded a $5 million Acoustic Corer™ contract in the US Gulf of Mexico.
        This 90-day campaign was the largest Acoustic Corer™ project undertaken by the Company to date.
       In September 2022, Kraken announced that it had signed a $9 million follow on contract to supply mine-hunting
        systems to a leading NATO Navy, which includes its KATFISH™ towed SAS system, Tentacle® Winch system, ALARS
        and topsides. Deliveries will occur in both 2023 and 2024.
       In September 2022, Kraken announced that it had received approval to sell its products and services to the
        Government of Canada under its Pathway to Commercialization initiative. Under this approval, direct purchases can
        be made up to $8 million per contract and are available to all government departments.
       In November 2022, Kraken signed a research & development (“R&D”) contract with a global energy company which
        will provide $8 million of cash funding to Kraken’s Brazilian subsidiary over a 3-year period. Under this project, Kraken
        will continue development of artificial intelligence and machine learning software, and subsea autonomy solutions to
        intelligently analyze sensor data and learn how to respond to highly dynamic environments in the offshore oil and
        gas, wind, hydrographic, science, and defense industries.
       In November 2022, Kraken received an initial order for subsea batteries valued at $14 million with deliveries to occur
        in 2023. Since acquiring this business in 2018, Kraken has received orders of over $38 million for is subsea batteries.
       Throughout 2022, Kraken received approximately $7.0 million in orders for its SAS product compared to
        approximately $3.0 million in the prior year. Demand for our SAS continues to increase over traditional side scan
        sonar driven by customer desire for strong intelligence about the subsea infrastructure in both shallow and deep-
        water installations and the modularity and versatility of our SAS having a track record of successful integration on
        over 20 different underwater platforms.
       In December 2022, Kraken was awarded a prime contract with the Government of Canada to provide Remote Mine-
        hunting and Disposal Systems for the Department of National Defense. The contract consists of an estimated 24-
        month acquisition program followed by an initial five-year Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) program, which includes
        options for additional equipment, spare parts, training, and technical support. If all options in the acquisition and ILS
        programs are selected, the total value will exceed $50 million, consisting of approximately $40 million for acquisition
        and $10 million for ILS.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Consolidated revenue in Q4 2022 was $8,813 compared to $15,018 in Q4 2021, and $40,908 for 2022, compared to $25,629
in 2021. Both periods were supported by our deliveries to DALO under our acquisition contract, full year of revenue from our
acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services (formerly PanGeo SubSea Inc.) and the continued growth in both our sensor and
batteries businesses. Adjusted EBITDA() in Q4 2022 was $931 compared to $3,476 for the same period in the prior year with
the decline associated with the timing of a large project delivery in Q4 2021. Adjusted EBITDA(1) for 2022 was $5,292, compared
to $2,149 in 2021, and was positively impacted by continued work pursuant to the DALO acquisition contract, the full year
impact of the PanGeo acquisition and the sale of sensors and batteries to both the commercial and defence markets.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.
Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our AquaPix® MINSAS sensors, KATFISH™ systems, and SeaPower™ subsea
battery systems. Product revenue in Q4 2022 was $5,080 (2021 - $12,682) and declined over the prior year due to a
KATFISH™ system being delivered in Q4 of the prior year. Revenue in Q4 2022 was generated from the sale of subsea
batteries, SAS sensors and continued work with the Royal Danish Navy. During 2022, the products business generated
revenue of $24.9 million compared to $22.2 million in the prior year, an increase of 12% due to the sale of subsea batteries,
SAS sensors and continued work with the Royal Danish Navy.
Kraken’s services business consists of services provided by robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our
Sub-Bottom Imager™, Acoustic Corer™, KATFISHTM, and SeaVision. Services revenue in Q4 2022 was $3,733 (2021- $2,336)
an increase of 60% over the prior year due to increased activity in the industry. Services in 2022 increased to $16,008 from
$3,478 in the prior year due to the full year impact from the acquisition as well as increased demand from customers in
decommissioning work, depth of burial campaigns, geohazards, unexploded ordinances identification and infrastructure
inspection.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of products based on shipments and the cost of delivery of services revenue as well as
the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged in product and services activities. Cost of sales in the quarter were
$4,420 (Q4 2021 - $8,555) and were lower due to timing of shipment of a KATFISH™ system in Q4 2021. During Q4 2022, the
Company realized gross margin of $4,393 (Q4 2021 – $6,463) resulting in a gross margin of 50% compared to 43% in Q4 2021.
The increase in gross margin percentage reflects a change in product and service revenue mix in the current quarter to higher
margin business compared to the prior year.
Cost of sales for 2022 were $23,871 (2021 - $14,310) an increase due to the growth in both the products and services business
but also the full year impact of our acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services. As a result, gross margin in 2022 increased to
$17,037(2021 - $11,319). Gross margin percentage for the year was 42% compared to 44% in the prior year due to change of
revenue mix in 2022 compared to 2021 as well as the full year impact of the acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services. During
the quarter, the Company recorded an impairment loss on inventory of $397 (Q4 2021-nil) related to its thruster and control
systems portfolio which is included in cost of sales.

Administration Expenses
Administration expenses in Q4 2022 increased 33% to $3,887 (Q4 2021 - $2,923) due to costs associated with growing our
business. Notable items in the administration expense category include: salaries and benefits expenses increased 37% to
$1,678 (Q4 2021 - $1,228), travel related costs increased $438 (Q4 2021 - $136) due to the easing of COVID related restrictions
on travel, software subscriptions increased to $311 (Q4 2021 - $234), accounting and legal decreased to $289 (Q4 2021 - $423),
office and shop supplies $269 (Q4 2021 - $182) and expected credit loss increased to $172 (Q4 2021 - $78).
Transaction and restructuring costs for Q4 2022 were $204 (Q4 2021 -$817) due to the acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services
as well as increasing efficiency in operations.
Administration expenses for the twelve months increased by $4,093 to $12,364 (2021 - $8,271) due to the acquisition of Kraken
Robotics Services and increased activity across the Company. At the end of 2022, Kraken employed 211 employees compared
to 225 in the prior year. Notable items in the administration expense category include: salaries and benefits increased to
$6,111 (2021 - $3,726) due to decreased government assistance including the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy which was
not present in 2022 and the full year inclusion of Kraken Robotics Services, travel related costs of $1,066 (2021-$232) which
increased due to the easing of COVID related restrictions and the return of business meetings, trade shows and conferences,
software subscriptions of $994 (2021 - $809). Accounting and legal costs declined slightly to $810 (2021- $964) as well as
transfer agency services/public company fees declined to $183 (2021 - $361).
Transaction and restructuring costs for 2022 were $850 (2021 -$817) for the year primarily related to the acquisition of Kraken
Robotics Services as well as increasing efficiency in operations.
Research and Development costs
R&D costs in the quarter decreased to $176 (Q4 2021 - $881), due to the timing of expenditures on various R&D programs as
well as the timing of government assistance which are netted against R&D. For 2022, R&D costs decreased to $1,262 (2021 -
$2,310) resulting from the timing of expenditures on various R&D programs and government assistance. Investment tax
credits recoverable increased to $634 (2021 - $594) related to increased scientific research and experimental development
activities.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased in the quarter and for the year due to the increased asset base and intangibles
associated with the acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services. Depreciation in the quarter totalled $964 (Q4 2021 - $795), while
amortization of intangible assets increased to $384 (Q4 2021 - $319). For 2022, depreciation increased to $3,236 (2021 -
$2,111) while amortization of intangible assets increased to $1,545 (2021 - $803).
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation expense in Q4 2022 was $178 (Q4 2021 - $13), representing the fair value of the options amortized
over the vesting period of the underlying options during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Share-based compensation for 2022 was $797 (2021 - $433) representing the fair value of the options amortized over the
vesting period of the underlying options during 2022. The increase reflects timing of when options are issued to employees,
management, and directors.

Financing Costs

Financing costs in Q4 2022 were $816 (Q4 2021 - $644) with the increase due to costs associated with the amortization of
letters of credit costs associated with larger projects.

For 2022, financing costs increased for the year were $3,261 (2021 - $1,657). The increase over the prior year relate to fair
value adjust on contingent consideration and the accretion on debt associated with the Kraken Robotics Services acquisition

Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA

The Company recorded a net loss in Q4 2022 of $1,270 and a comprehensive net loss of $1,598, as compared to net income
of $548 and comprehensive net income of $855 for the same period of prior year. The change over the prior year was driven
due to the timing of a large shipment in Q4 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2022 was $931 or an 11% adjusted EBITDA margin
compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $3,476 and adjusted EBITDA margin of 23% in the prior year. The change over the prior
was driven by the timing of a large shipment in Q4 2021.
For 2022 the Company recorded a net loss of $4,243 and a comprehensive loss of $4,880 compared to a loss of $3,537 and
comprehensive loss of 3,332 for the same period of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $5,292 or 13% Adjusted
EBITDA margin compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $2,149 or 8% in the prior year. The increase was due to overall growth in
our business as well as full year impact of our acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of ($2,035) (2021 – $6,365). Cash and cash equivalents as at
December 31, 2022 was $8,265 as compared with $6,754 at December 31, 2021.
On July 26, 2021, the Company completed a bought deal financing for 20,000,000 units at a price of $0.50 per Unit for gross
proceeds of approximately $10 million (the “Offering”). Each Unit consisted of one common share of the Company and one-
half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole purchase warrant, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder to
acquire one common share (a “Warrant Share”) at a price of $0.60 per Warrant Share for a period of two years following the
closing of the Offering, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances.
Net proceeds from the Offering after underwriters’ commission and legal and accounting expenses of $1,089 related to the
offering were $8,910. Use of proceeds from the Offering included: cash consideration for the acquisition of PGH Capital -
$3,000; partial repayment of PanGeo indebtedness - $689; transaction costs related to acquisition of PanGeo - $534 and
working capital and general corporate purposes of both Kraken and PanGeo - $4,687.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received proceeds of $132 upon the exercise of 326,250 stock options
(December 31, 2021 – proceeds of $305 upon the exercise of 1,311 stock options). During 2022, the Company received
proceeds of $3 on the exercise of 5,000 common share purchase warrants.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company experienced cash inflows of $5,237 (2021 – cash outflows
$11,006) from operating activities. Cash outflows from investing activities were $3,366 versus $7,244 for 2021. Financing
activities realized outflows of $41 (2021 – cash inflows $11,923).
Overall, excluding the foreign exchange impact on cash, cash increased by $1,830 to $8,265 (2021 – $6,754).
A commercial bank issued standby letters of credit on behalf of the Company to customers in the amounts of US$6,215
(C$8,432), US$1,960 (C$2,659) and US$830 (C$1,126) on advance guarantees secured by Export Development Canada. The
letters of credit expire on October 30, 2023, November 30, 2023 and October 31, 2024, respectively.
No cash dividends have been declared or paid since the date of incorporation and the Company has no present intention of
paying dividends on its common shares. The Company anticipates that all available funds will be used to finance the growth of
its business.

ACQUISTIONS

Kraken Robotics Services (formerly PanGeo Subsea)
On July 30, 2021 Kraken closed its acquisition of PGH Capital Inc. and its subsidiaries, PanGeo Subsea Inc. and PanGeo Subsea
Scotland Limited (collectively with PGH Capital, “PanGeo”). PanGeo specializes in high-resolution 3D acoustic imaging solutions
for the sub-seabed. PanGeo’s assets consist primarily of human capital, know-how and equipment comprised mostly of sub
bottom imaging units and acoustic imaging units that are used to provide sub-seabed survey services. Effective January 1,
2023 PanGeo Subsea Inc. was renamed Kraken Robotics Services Ltd. And PanGeo Subsea Scotland Limited has been renamed
Kraken Robotics Services UK Limited.

The aggregate purchase price for PanGeo is up to $23 million comprised of the following:

       $3 million payable on closing;
       12,068,965 common shares having a value of $0.58 each and $7 million in the aggregate issued on closing;
       $4 million to be paid in cash, plus interest at a rate of 6% per annum, on the second anniversary of the closing date,
        by non-transferable promissory notes; and
       Up to an aggregate of $9 million to be paid pursuant to an earn-out on the following terms:
            o an amount equal to 300% of the amount by which certain qualifying revenues in the one-year period
                 immediately following the closing date exceeds $9,500, up to a maximum payment of $4,500 (the “First Earn-
                 Out Amount”); and
            o the amount equal to 300% of the amount by which certain qualifying revenues in the two-year period
                 immediately following the closing date exceeds $21,500, up to a maximum payment of $4,500 less any
                 amount paid pursuant to the First Earn-Out Amount (the “Second Earn-Out Amount”, and together with the
                 First Earn-Out Amount, the “Earn-Out Amounts”).

The Earn-Out Amounts will be paid within thirty business days following the filing deadline date or the actual filling date on
SEDAR, whichever is the earliest, of Kraken’s quarterly financial statements for the quarter that includes the first or second
year anniversary of the closing date, as the case may be. At Kraken’s option and, subject always to the approval of the TSX
Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) at the time, payments required to be made in respect of the Earn-Out Amounts may be satisfied
by way of a cash payment equal to 50% of the Earn-Out Amount and the issuance of common shares having an aggregate value
equal to the remaining 50% of the Earn-Out Amount then due and payable.

The Company paid the First Earn-Out Amount of $4,500 to the sellers of PanGeo Subsea on January 11, 2023. The Company
elected to satisfy 50% of the First Earn-Out Amount through the issuance of an aggregate of 4,500,000 common shares (the
“Consideration Shares”) at a deemed price of $0.50 per Consideration Share and the remaining 50% of the First Earn-out
Amount in cash.

The Promissory Notes also provides Kraken with the option, subject to TSXV approval at the time, to satisfy up to 40% of any
principal amount owing under the Promissory Notes by issuing Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the PanGeo
Agreement.

The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the assets acquired, and liabilities
assumed were recorded at their estimated fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of cash, accounts receivable and
trade and other payables were deemed to be approximate to their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these
assets and liabilities. The fair value of fixed assets and right-of-use assets has been determined based on market comparison
and replacement cost techniques. The replacement cost of these assets has been determined and depreciated replacement
cost reflects fair value.

OceanVision™ Project

The Company’s OceanVision™ project is focused on the development of a RaaS offering for underwater seabed imagery and
mapping. The OceanVision™ project began in the second half of 2019 and was a three-year, $18.8 million project focused on
the development of new marine technologies and products to enable an underwater robotics service business. The goal was
to develop a turnkey service solution for ultra-high definition seafloor imaging, mapping and analytics, including simultaneous
acquisition of ocean environmental and marine habitat data. Rapid high-throughput data will make it possible to significantly
reduce the cost of obtaining high resolution seafloor imaging and mapping allowing end-users to make more informed
operational decisions in real-time. The project began in Q3 2019 and has seen Kraken deploy its sensors and unmanned
underwater platforms to conduct ultra-high-definition seabed imaging and mapping on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and
other areas of Atlantic Canada. As at December 31, 2022 the initial project has been largely completed and Kraken now has a
highly capable services business capable of providing high resolution seabed and sub-seabed imagery to customers in Canada,
the US, Europe, and Taiwan.

Financial Contributions Awarded
At December 31, 2022, Kraken had $14.2 million remaining in grant funding to be offset against R&D activities of which cash
of $2.2 million has been received for projects to be completed during 2023.
Significant components of this remaining funding are as follows:
In August 2021, Kraken Robotics Services was awarded $2.0 million in funding from the Ocean Supercluster for its development
for its GeoScan Wide Area Acoustic Corer of which $0.6 million has been received.
In November 2021, Kraken was awarded $2.3 million in funding from the Newfoundland Offshore Oil and Gas Industry
Recovery Assistance (OOGIRA) Fund for the development of its Fast Remote 3D Digital Inspection Technology Demonstration
project. This project completed in December 2022.
Also in November 2021, Kraken Robotics Services was awarded $4.8 million in funding from OOGIRA for the development of
its GeoTrac project of which $2.4 million has been received.
In November 2022, Kraken was awarded $8.0 million in funding to its Brazilian subsidiary to continue development on artificial
intelligence, machine learning software and subsea autonomy solutions. No monies on this project were received in 2022.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company is a relatively new company with limited operating history and, in addition to facing all of the competitive risks
in the underwater sonar and robotics sector it will face all the risks inherent in developing a business including: access to
capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and maintain customers and the ability to put in
place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

Due to ‘COVID-19’, there has been significant economic volatility and supply change disruption. In addition, the geopolitical
risk currently being experienced may cause continued economic volatility and impact the supply chain. During the year, the
Company experienced minor delays in procuring components and conducting sea trials.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities, contingent consideration, and long-term
obligations. The Company will make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial
position and performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback
shares or pay dividends, issue debt or sell assets to reduce debt.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company’s related parties are its directors and executive members. Transactions with these related parties are described
in Note 21 in the 2022 audited consolidated financial statements of the Company.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at December 31, 2022, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are
summarized below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                          December 31, 2022            December 31, 2021
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                       $     8,265                  $     6,754
 Trade and other receivables                                                         12,221                         6,095
 Contract assets                                                                       4,347                        2,699
                                                                                  $ 24,833                     $ 15,548


At December 31 2022, 52% of the trade receivables balance was owing from two customers (2021 – 45% of the trade
receivables was owing from two customers). At December 31, 2022 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $11,817
(2021 – $4,639).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had a cash balance of $8,265 (December 31, 2021 - $6,754). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they
come due is dependent on the Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage
contract negotiations with payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company
will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the
Company to generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At December 31, 2022, the Company held $8,265 in cash and has drawn $4,309, $652 and $1,405 against its
          operating lines of credit. The drawn operating line of credit bears interest annually at bank prime plus 2.5%, 3.95%
          and bank prime plus 2.5% respectively, payable monthly.
          The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit balance.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
Fair Value:
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified
assets and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate the carrying
amounts.
    The following table provides the disclosures of the fair value and the level in the hierarchy:
      December 31, 2022                                                     Level 1                Level 2           Level 3
      Financial assets at amortized cost:
           Cash and cash equivalents                                             $ 8,265       $            -    $             -
           Trade and other receivables                                                 -               12,221                  -
      Financial liabilities at amortized cost:
           Bank indebtedness                                                                            6,366
           Trade and other payables                                                     -              11,220                  -
           Long-term obligations                                                        -               6,015                  -
      Financial liabilities at FVTPL
           Contingent consideration                                                     -                    -          8,388


USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
    (a) The IASB issued the following standards that have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial
        statements as their effective dates fall within annual periods beginning subsequent to the current reporting period.
        The Company intends to adopt these standards, amendments and interpretations when they become effective.

        Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)
        On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, to clarify the
        classification of liabilities as current or non-current. On July 15, 2020 the IASB issued an amendment to defer the
        effective date by one year. The amendments removed the requirement for a right to defer settlement or roll over of
        a liability for at least twelve months to be unconditional. Instead such a right must have substance and exist at the
        end of the reporting period. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
        Early adoption is permitted. The extent of the impact of the change has not yet been determined.

        Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)
        On May 7, 2021, the IASB issued Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
        (Amendments to IAS 12). The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption so that is does not
        apply to the transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. The amendments are effective
        for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The extent of the impact of
        the change has not yet been determined.

        Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)
        On February 12, 2021, the IASB issued Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8). The amendments
        introduce a new definition for accounting estimates, clarifying that they are monetary amounts in the financial
        statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The amendments also clarify the relationship between
        accounting policies and accounting estimates by specifying that a company develops an accounting estimate to
        achieve the objective set out by an accounting policy. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning
        on or after January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The extent of the impact of the change has not yet been
        determined.
     (b) The following amended IFRS pronouncements were adopted effective January 1, 2022 and had no impact to the
         Company’s financial statements:

          Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37)
          On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37). This
          amendment clarifies which costs are included as a cost of fulfilling a contract when determining whether a contract
          is onerous. The amendments were effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 and apply to
          contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied.

          Property, Plant and Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16)
          On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued Property, Plant and Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to
          IAS 16). The amendments clarify that proceeds from selling items before the related item of Property, Plant and
          Equipment is available for use should be recognised in profit or loss, together with the cost of producing those
          items. The amendments were effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA margin and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios,
when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate
the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do not have any standardized
meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies.
This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined at adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
