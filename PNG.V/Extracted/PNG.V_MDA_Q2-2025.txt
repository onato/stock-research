                                 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                        FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED June 30, 2025
                              (Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated)

This Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Kraken Robotics Inc. (the “Company” or “Kraken”) provides analysis of
the Company’s financial results for the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2025 and should be read in conjunction
with the Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
2025 and the notes thereto, and the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2024, and the notes thereto, which are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. The information presented in the MD&A is
as of August 20, 2025, the date of preparation.
The June 30, 2025 condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are applicable to the
preparation of interim financial statements. These financial statements were prepared using the same accounting policies and
methods of computation, and are subject to the same use of estimates and judgments, as the Company’s audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial
statements do not include all disclosures required by IFRS for annual consolidated financial statements and accordingly should
be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024
prepared in accordance with IFRS. All amounts other than per-share amounts are expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars,
unless otherwise stated.
Non-IFRS Measures
The Company has included certain non-IFRS measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, gross profit, gross
profit margin, and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS measures, when supplementing measures determined
in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company.
Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable
to similar measures employed by other companies. Further information, including reconciliations of these measures to the most
directly comparable IFRS measures, can be found at the end of this MD&A under the heading “Non-IFRS Measures”.

3D AT DEPTH ACQUISITION

On April 1, 2025, the Company, through its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the
assets of 3D at Depth, Inc. (“3D at Depth”), a privately held company headquartered in Colorado, USA, specializing in advanced
subsea LiDAR laser scanning and data services for offshore energy, defense, and scientific applications. The total purchase
consideration was $23.5 million, comprised of cash on closing and the assumption of certain liabilities and subject to customary
working capital adjustments.

The acquisition of 3D at Depth expands Kraken’s presence in the United States, adds a proven and complementary technology
to our product and services portfolio, and enhances our capacity to deliver integrated subsea survey and inspection solutions.
3D at Depth’s proprietary LiDAR technology offers sub-millimeter accuracy for subsea metrology, which, when combined with
Kraken’s existing sonar, sub-bottom, and robotics platforms, will enable broader service offerings to our offshore energy and
defense customers. The acquisition also provides access to a highly experienced technical and operations team as well as an
established customer base.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under IFRS 3, Business Combinations. The purchase price
allocation is preliminary and subject to change as the Company finalizes the fair value assessment of the acquired assets and
liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. As at June 30, 2025, the provisional allocation resulted in the
recognition of intangible assets related to technology, customer relationships, and trademarks, as well as goodwill reflecting
expected synergies.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Consolidated revenue in Q2 2025 increased 13% to $26,390 (Q2 2024 - $22,758). Revenue in the quarter was driven by
continued growth in our subsea battery business, and both organic growth and the acquisition of 3D at Depth within our
service business. Consolidated revenue for the six-month period ending June 30, 2025, declined 3% to $42,518 (2024 -$43,633)
as growth in our subsea battery and services businesses was offset by lower product revenue in the current period resulting
from our RMDS project and the timing of KATFISH™ sales. Net loss in Q2 2025 was $699 (Q2 2024 – net income of $2,609),
while net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025 was $484 (2024 – net income of $4,784). Adjusted EBITDA 1 in Q2
2025 was $4,674 (Q2 2024 – $5,444), while Adjusted EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, was $7,468 (2024
– $9,545).

 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For further information and detailed reconciliations to the most
directly comparable IFRS measures, see “Non-IFRS Measures” in this MD&A.
Revenue
The Company produces revenue from sales in two categories: products and services.

Kraken’s product business consists primarily of subsea sensor products, including our SAS, KATFISH™ and RMDS systems and
subsea battery systems.
Product revenue in Q2 2025 decreased 14% to $16,546 (Q2 2024 - $19,245). Product revenue for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2025, decreased 27% to $25,708 (2024- $35,263). For the quarter and for the six-month period, revenue from subsea
battery system continued to grow at a significant pace, while revenue from RMDS was lower in the current year due to the
near completion of the project and KATFISHTM revenue was lower due to timing of deliveries.

Kraken’s service business consists of a robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our Sub-Bottom Imager™,
Acoustic Corer™, KATFISHTM, SeaVision and the recently acquired 3D at Depth service offering of subsea LIDAR imaging.
Service revenue in Q2 2025 increased 180% to $9,844 (Q2 2024- $3,513) due to organic growth and the acquisition of 3D at
Depth. Service revenue in the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, increased 100% to $16,810 (2024 - $8,370) due to a high
utilization of Sub-Bottom Imager™ assets and the acquisition of 3D at Depth.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of products based on shipments and the cost of delivery of services revenue as well as
the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged in product and services activities.
Cost of sales in the quarter was $11,628 (Q2 2024 - $11,151), an increase due to higher revenue in the quarter as well of
change of revenue mix. During Q2 2025, the Company realized gross profit of $14,628 (Q2 2024 – $11,607) resulting in a gross

programs and government assistance. Year-to-date, ITCs were $540 (2024 - $298).
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation in Q2 2025 increased 55% to $1,568 (Q2 2024 -$1,013). For the six-month period ended June 30, 2025,
depreciation increased 30% to $2,761 (2024- $2,116) due to increased capital expenditures. In Q2 2025, amortization of
intangible assets increased to $771 (Q2 2024- $360) and increased to $1,156 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025
(2024 - $682) in the prior year due to the growth in intangible assets including those associated with the acquisition of 3D at
Depth.
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation expense increased in Q2 2025 to $672 (Q2 2024 - $30), while year-to-date share-based
compensation increased to $1,076 (2024 - $87), due to the timing of stock option grants.
Financing Costs

Financing costs in Q2 2025 increased to $981 (Q2 2024 - $559) in the same period of the prior year. Year-to-date, financing

In Q2 2025, adjusted EBITDA decreased 16% to $4,674 (Q2 2024 - $5,444) in Q2 2024, an 18% adjusted EBITDA margin
compared to 24% in Q2 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, decreased 22% to $7,468 (2024
- $9,545), an 18% adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 22% in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased in the current year
was due lower project revenue and increased administrative costs as we invest in increased resources to execute on the
opportunities in our business pipeline.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As at June 30, 2025, the Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $71,813 (June 30,
2024 – $40,979). Cash as at June 30, 2025, was $32,867 as compared to $20,393 as at June 30, 2024.
During the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, the Company experienced cash inflows of $1,539 (2024 – cash outflows of
$6,564) from operating activities. Cash outflows from investing activities were $32,408 versus $1,560 for the same period in
2024. Financing activities resulted in inflows of $6,988 versus $23,218 for the same period in 2024.
During 2024 the Company closed two bought deal equity financings for gross proceeds of $7,187 by issuing 21,185,300
common shares at a price of $0.95 per share in the first financing and 32,343,750 common shares at a price of $1.60 per share
in the second. The net proceeds of the offerings are expected to be used by the Company to (i) to facilitate its long term
strategy, including potential investment in facilities, expanding manufacturing capacity, anticipated working capital for
expansion of sole-source/single award programs and high probability pipeline opportunities; (ii) to further strengthen the
Company’s balance sheet in anticipation of upcoming customer and partners decisions and source selection on additional
large, new program and contract opportunities; and (iii) for general corporate purposes. Per the final short form prospectus
the anticipated and approximate amounts used are below:

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company faces competitive risks in the underwater sonar and robotics sector and will face all the risks inherent in
developing a business including: access to capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and
maintain customers and the ability to put in place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – Competition within the market of the Company may reduce its ability to procure future contracts and
     sales. The industry in which the Company operates is competitive. Many of the competitors of the Company are large,
     diversified corporations in the sensor and marine robotics products and services industry. Some of the competitors of
     the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities.
     There can be no assurance that the Company can continue to compete effectively with these companies;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The marine sensor, robotics and battery markets are characterized by rapidly-changing technologies
     and evolving industry standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all, or at reasonable cost. If any of the suppliers fail to meet the needs of the
     Company, it may not have readily available alternatives;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company. The termination of funding for a government program would
     result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program that could have a negative impact on the
     operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

The geopolitical risk currently being experienced globally may cause economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company has experienced in the past minor delays in procuring components.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities, bank indebtedness, and long-term
obligations. The Company will make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial
position and performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback
shares, issue debt or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at June 30, 2025, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are summarized
below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                                June 30, 2025         December 31, 2024
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                        $   32,867               $    58,518
 Trade and other receivables                                                          16,844                    18,699
 Investment tax credits recoverable                                                       784                     1,018
 Long-term investment tax credits recoverable                                           1,817                     1,571
 Contract assets                                                                      18,268                    17,707
                                                                                  $ 70,580                   $ 97,513
At June 30, 2025, 80% of the trade receivables were owing from two customers (June 30, 2024 - 54% of trade receivables were
owing from two customers). At June 30, 2025, the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $11,033 (December 31, 2024
– $1,083).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had a cash balance
of $32,867 (December 31, 2024 - $58,518). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent on the
Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations with
payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to generate
sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At June 30, 2025, the Company has drawn $nil against its operating line of credit in Kraken Power GmbH. The drawn
          operating line of credit bears interest annually at bank prime plus 3.95%, payable monthly. The Company has also
          drawn $14,684 against the term revolving credit facility, which bears interest at bank prime plus margin, payable
          monthly. An increase (decrease) of 1,000 basis points in the interest rate would have increased (decreased the
          Company’s net income by approximately $1.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:

                                                                               June 30, 2025          December 31, 2024
       Financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency:
          Trade and other payables USD                                              $    1,403                       $    2,473
          Trade and other payables GBP                                                     444                              920
          Trade and other payables EUR                                                   2,714                            3,268
          Trade and other payables DKK                                                     143                              129
          Trade and other payables BRL                                                     543                              382
           Long-term debt EUR                                                              162                              503
           Bank indebtedness EUR                                                             -                                -
       Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
          Trade and other receivables USD                                                8,670                            5,944
          Trade and other receivables GBP                                                2,913                              427
          Trade and other receivables EUR                                                  347                              336
          Trade and other receivables DKK                                                    4                                4
          Trade and other receivables BRL                                                    2                              373

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in the
exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net income by approximately $1,034 (2024 - $107).

Fair Value:
During the three-months and year ended June 30, 2025, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified
assets and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate the carrying
amounts.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to
estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities are accounted for
prospectively.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On July 7, 2025, the Company closed a public offering of 43,240,000 common shares at a price of $2.66 per Common Share,
for aggregate gross proceeds of $115,018, inclusive of the full exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters of
the offering. The Company expects to use the net proceeds of the offering to support the Company’s growth into a scalable
global prime contractor, including: (1) enhancing the ability to consider larger accretive acquisitions particularly in the United
States and Europe given the Company’s strengthened global profile; (2) demonstrating a stronger balance sheet when
bidding for larger governmental and commercial contracts; and (3) for general corporate purposes.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA margin, gross profit, gross profit margin, and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial
measures and non-IFRS ratios, when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an
improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do
not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures
employed by other companies. This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any. Adjusted EBITDA margin is

The Company’s revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead times on part
purchases, and the timing of procurement processes. The Company has found that government orders for equipment, which
constitute a significant proportion of the Company’s products revenue, do not occur on regular or predictable intervals. In
recent years, the Company has found that government orders tend to peak in Q3, with deliveries targeted in Q4, and that new
orders from governments slow in Q1, though actual outcomes depend on the timing of contract specific negotiations and
actual production and delivery. Quarterly results have been positively impacted over the past two years from the growth of
our KATFISH™, subsea battery, sensor and systems and service businesses.
