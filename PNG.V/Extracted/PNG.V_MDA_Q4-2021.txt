NATURE OF BUSINESS
Kraken Robotics Inc. (formerly Kraken Sonar Inc.) was incorporated on May 14, 2008 under the Business Corporations Act,
British Columbia, is a publicly traded company, and its registered office is at 100 King Street West, #1600, Toronto, Ontario,
M5X 1G5.
The Company’s principal business is the design, manufacture and sale of software centric sensors, batteries, and underwater
robotic systems.
Company Overview

Kraken Robotics Inc. (PNG: TSX-V) is a marine technology company supplying advanced sonar and optical sensors, batteries,
and underwater robotics equipment and services for military and commercial applications. The Company is recognized as
world leading innovators of Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) - a revolutionary underwater imaging technology that dramatically
improves seabed surveys by providing ultra-high resolution imagery at superior coverage rates. Both military and commercial
markets are showing encouraging growth as they are now incorporating unmanned vehicles and intelligent sensors in their
procurement plans and budgets. In July 2021, Kraken acquired PanGeo Subsea, a leading services company specializing in high-
resolution 3D acoustic imaging solutions for the sub-seabed. PanGeo with offices in Canada, the United States and the United
Kingdom is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Kraken.

AQUAPIX® MINSAS SENSOR FOR UNDERWATER VEHICLES
The AquaPix® MINSAS (Miniature Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Sonar) sensor is based upon Kraken’s core Synthetic
Aperture Sonar technology. The MINSAS compact receiver array length of only 60cm recently improved the AquaPix® SAS
image resolution from 3.0 x 3.3 cm (across along track) to an industry-leading 1.9 x 2.1 cm while maintaining a constant Ultra
HD resolution across ranges up to 120M per side. The lightweight array is integrated into a small modular payload section,
which can be easily mobilized in customers’ Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) of all sizes. The MINSAS includes a Real
Time SAS Processor and the combination with the lightweight array provides operators with a high area coverage rate at full
SAS resolution, enabling highly efficient survey operations. Development continues upon Kraken’s core Synthetic Aperture
Sonar technology. The MINSAS light weight receiver array recently reduced the weight by 40% while maintaining the AquaPix®
SAS image resolution of 3.0 x 3.3 cm. Development continues of our new Multispectral SAS product, this product will provide
a unique capability, enabling simultaneous ultra-high-resolution acoustic imagery and buried object detection from the same
sensor. While our SAS technologies are focused on the Mine Counter Measures (MCM) market, Kraken also has a core
competency in implementation of digital signal processing and user interface software for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)
sonar applications and is working on developments in passive array technologies for the ASW market.

OPTICAL
The SeaVision® 3D laser system is the world's first RGB underwater laser imaging system that offers the resolution, range and
scan rate to deliver dense full colour 3D point cloud images of subsea infrastructure with millimeter accuracy, in real time. The
ability to generate accurate 3D reconstruction of underwater infrastructure is an important requirement for commercial,
military and ocean research applications. The initial system is designed for deployment on underwater robotic platforms such
as Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and AUVs. Kraken continues to see significant interest in SeaVision® from customers
across many industries from defense, to offshore oil and gas and renewable energy. This interest has led to numerous pilots


                                                               2
and demonstrations with major energy players in North America, South America, and Europe. As this activity continues, Kraken
is focusing its efforts in building a subsea infrastructure inspection service offering.
Kraken’s development of a unique, non-contact mooring chain inspection tool continues with commercialization scheduled
for 2022. This tool, utilizing the SeaVision® platform can be used to support existing offshore oil and gas inspection
requirements, as well as upcoming offshore wind inspection requirements. This new platform is anticipated to significantly
reduce the cost of inspecting critical infrastructure, which must be inspected regularly.

UNDERWATER VEHICLES

KATFISH™
Kraken has developed the Kraken Active Towed Fish (KATFISH™) for high speed, high resolution seabed mapping. The system
enables real-time seabed imagery, bathymetry and advanced 3D digital terrain models of the seabed – optimized for both
manned and unmanned surface vessels. Coupled with Kraken’s revolutionary AquaPix® MINSAS, it is especially well-suited for
both military and commercial seabed surveys.

KATFISH™ is a tightly integrated intelligent winch system (TENTACLE™) and an autonomous LARS system that can launch AUVS
from vessels, host facilities and docking stations. Both the Tentacle Winch® and the ALARS are constructed of non-welded
aluminum for high strength, low weight, and low magnetic signature.
In the commercial seabed survey market, KATFISH™ offers offshore energy companies the advantage of comprehensive, high-
resolution surveys of existing infrastructure, such as pipelines and subsea stations, completed in at least half the time as more
conventional methods. KATFISH™ operates at speeds up to 10 knots, versus the slow moving 1-2 knots of ROV or the medium
3-4 knots of the passively stable sonar systems, thus reducing operating time and cost.
In the defence market, there is a growing global requirement for modernization of mine countermeasure (MCM) solutions.
The previous generation of single-role mine hunting vessels designed and built between the 1970's - 1990's are now being
withdrawn from service. This leaves a growing requirement for high resolution, high speed seabed imaging platforms.
The ability of the KATFISH™ platform to generate centimetre-scale sonar resolution in all three dimensions can provide
significant improvement in the detection, classification and identification of small seabed objects for both military and
commercial seabed survey missions.
Kraken has high expectations for the KATFISH™ which provides high performance underwater mapping and mine hunting
capabilities from a towed platform for both the military and commercial markets and expects it to be a key revenue driver for
the Company. The Company has in the past and will in the future partner as a supplier to large defense contractors who are
involved in various multi-unit bids.
Recent updates and developments with KATFISH™ include:
    •    In September 2020, Kraken secured a contract through a competitive bid process with the Danish Ministry of Defence,
         Acquisition and Logistics Organization to supply mine-hunting sonar equipment to the Royal Danish Navy. Under the
         program, Kraken will provide its mine-hunting KATFISH™ towed SAS system, the Tentacle® Winch system, and
         Autonomous Launch and Recovery System (“ALARS”) to be integrated onboard the Royal Danish Navy’s optionally
         unmanned surface vessels. The aggregate value of the contract is $36 million, deliverable over a 5-to-10-year period,
         with the majority of funds (approximately $22 million) to be received over the two-to-three-year product acquisition
         phase, with the remaining funds (approximately $14 million) being allocated to post sales service arrangements which
         will continue for the duration of the remaining term.
    •    In September 2020, Kraken signed a contract for supply of mine-hunting systems to Remontowa Shipbuilding S.A., to
         be integrated on the Polish Navy’s new KORMORAN II CounterMeasure (MCMV) vessels. This system was delivered
         during the fourth quarter of 2021.

THUNDERFISH® AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE (AUV)

Kraken continues its ThunderFish® AUV development program. Kraken’s original ThunderFish® AUV prototype is a technical
upgrade of Fraunhofer’s DeDave AUV. Kraken will pay Fraunhofer a royalty based on a percentage of each sale with minimum

                                                               3
commitments starting in 2022. The ThunderFish® AUV was designed for deep sea military, commercial and scientific
applications for use as a sensor and robotics technology demonstration platform to support ongoing development of the
Company’s underwater sensor and robotics programs.

Kraken has established a long-term technical co-operation program with Fraunhofer for technologies that can be deployed in
Kraken’s ThunderFish® AUV program. While Kraken is committed to grant research and development projects to Fraunhofer
of €300,000 per year for a period of three years (2019-2021), these projects will be awarded to Fraunhofer as various
statement of works are agreed upon and purchase orders issued.

As a result of funding included in Kraken’s OceanVision project, in Q3 2020 Kraken kicked off development of a ThunderFish®
XL.

Building from the previous development efforts of the ThunderFish® Alpha AUV, the ThunderFish® XL AUV is being designed
to be larger with an increased depth rating, larger payload capacity and longer mission endurance. It is being developed with
the following key capabilities:

    1.   The ability to transition from high-speed survey mode to “zero” speed hovering mode in-mission;

    2.   Through-the sensor acoustic, laser and optical target detection, image recognition and inspection; and,

    3.   Using onboard sensors to improve vehicle navigational accuracy.

In the AUV space, Kraken is focused on using the ThunderFish® XL AUVs and procured AUVs to build a fleet of vehicles capable
of providing Robotics as a Service rather than having a primary focus on selling AUVs. We expect that this will provide Kraken
with a unique and valuable market position. The ThunderFish® XL AUV is expected to be in service in 2022 with R&D costs
(excluding monies paid to Fraunhofer) being part of the OceanVision™ project.

POWER SYSTEMS

Kraken designs and manufactures unique pressure tolerant thrusters, drives, batteries, battery management systems, and
electronics. These are specialized deep-sea components for AUVs and ROVs. Kraken’s unique pressure tolerant gel
encapsulation technology for lithium polymer batteries provides an attractively priced, eco-friendly and superior alternative
to oil compensated batteries currently used for subsea battery applications. Kraken’s technology and products enable a
significant reduction in bill of material costs for our ThunderFish® AUV over acquiring conventional batteries. During 2021,
Kraken delivered batteries to both defence and commercial customers.

ROBOTICS AS A SERVICE (RaaS)
Kraken believes that certain customers would prefer to hire the company to provide product output (i.e. imaging and
bathymetry data) to them using the Kraken’s own equipment, rather than the customer buying the equipment and having to
own and operate and maintain the equipment. This is the genesis of Kraken’s RaaS offering. Kraken expects RaaS to become
a growing part of its revenue mix over time. Kraken will provide RaaS services to customers using Kraken’s KATFISH™ towed
underwater vehicles and AUVs such as ThunderFish® XL and Dive-LD and innovative sensors like the SeaVision® 3D laser
system. While RaaS revenue is starting from a small base, Kraken is bidding on opportunities involving both shallow and deeper
water surveys with the KATFISH™,ThunderFish®, and Dive-LD as well as our SeaVision® 3D laser system. In July 2021 Kraken
was awarded a $0.6 million RaaS job to survey a subsea electric cable using the company’s KATFISH™ and ALARS survey
platform. Over the last 12 months, Kraken has been actively bidding on RaaS-type survey contracts and recently hired a Marine
Survey Manager to lead the efforts to grow this offering. In addition, Kraken expects RaaS growth to accelerate and expects
significant revenue synergies from its acquisition of PanGeo Subsea, which was completed in July 2021.

PANGEO SUBSEA
On July 30, 2021 Kraken closed its acquisition of PGH Capital Inc. PGH Capital operates its business through its subsidiaries,
PanGeo Subsea Inc. and PanGeo Subsea Scotland Limited (collectively with PGH Capital, “PanGeo”). PanGeo was a private
Canadian services company specializing in high-resolution 3D acoustic imaging solutions for the sub-seabed with offices in St.


                                                              4
John’s, Newfoundland and Aberdeen, United Kingdom. PanGeo’s assets consist primarily of human capital, know-how and
equipment comprised mostly of sub bottom imaging units and acoustic imaging units that are used to provide sub-seabed
survey services.

The aggregate purchase price for PanGeo is up to $23 million comprised of the following:

    •    $3 million payable on closing;
    •    12,068,965 Common Shares having a value of $0.58 each and $7 million in the aggregate issued on closing;
    •    $4 million to be paid in cash, plus interest at a rate of 6% per annum, on the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
         by a non-transferable promissory notes; and
    •    Up to an aggregate of $9 million to be paid pursuant to an earn-out on the following terms:
              o an amount equal to 300% of the amount by which certain qualifying revenues in the one-year period
                  immediately following the Closing Date exceeds $9,500,000, up to a maximum payment of $4,500,000 (the
                  “First Earn-Out Amount”); and
              o the amount equal to 300% of the amount by which certain qualifying revenues in the two-year period
                  immediately following the Closing Date exceeds $21,500,000, up to a maximum payment of $4,500,000 less
                  any amount paid pursuant to the First Earn-Out Amount (the “Second Earn-Out Amount”, and together with
                  the First Earn-Out Amount, the “Earn-Out Amounts”).

The Earn-Out Amounts will be paid within thirty business days following the filing deadline date or the actual filling date on
SEDAR, whichever is the earliest, of Kraken’s quarterly financial statements for the quarter that includes first or second year
anniversary of the Closing Date, as the case may be. At Kraken’s option and, subject always to the approval of the TSX Venture
Exchange (the “TSXV”) at the time, payments required to be made in respect of the Earn-Out Amounts may be satisfied by way
of a cash payment equal to 50% of the Earn-Out Amount and the issuance of Common Shares having an aggregate value equal
to the remaining 50% of the Earn-Out Amount then due and payable.

The Corporation has determined that this transaction is a business combination as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
constitute a business. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the assets
acquired, and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair value at the acquisition date. Fair value of cash, accounts
receivable and trade and other payables were deemed to be approximate to their carrying amounts due to the short-term
nature of these assets and liabilities. Fair value of fixed assets and right-of-use assets has been determined based on market
comparison and replacement cost techniques. Replacement cost of these assets has been determined and depreciated
replacement cost reflects fair value.

OCEANVISON™ PROJECT

The Company’s OceanVision™ project is focused on the development of a RaaS offering for underwater seabed imagery and
mapping. The OceanVision™ project began in the second half of 2019, with the contract formally signed in January 2020.
OceanVision™ is a three-year, $18.8 million project focused on the development of new marine technologies and products to
enable an underwater robotics data acquisition and data analytics as a service business. This will be a turnkey service solution
for ultra-high definition seafloor imaging, mapping and analytics, including simultaneous acquisition of ocean environmental
and marine habitat data. It will result in an end-to-end digitalization solution offering advanced sensors, robots and data
analytics as a turnkey service solution for seafloor imaging and mapping. Rapid high-throughput data analytics will make it
possible to significantly reduce the cost of obtaining high resolution seafloor imaging and mapping allowing end-users to make
more informed operational decisions in real-time.
The new technologies Kraken will develop within the scope of the OceanVision™ project are currently unavailable in a fully
matured and tightly integrated offering in the commercial industry. The combination of a hovering-capable AUV with the
potential for subsea residency, and a cutting-edge suite of acoustic and optical sensors, is a powerful package. As Kraken is the
manufacturer of all the major vehicle components (i.e., sensors, batteries, propulsion system and software), it is Kraken’s belief
that its robotics platforms and services can be provided at a much lower overall cost than competing systems.



                                                                5
The project began in Q3 2019 and Kraken has deployed its sensors and unmanned underwater platforms to conduct ultra-
high-definition seabed imaging and mapping on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and other areas of Atlantic Canada as part
of the OceanVision™ project. To date, Kraken has completed three offshore campaigns under this project.
To fund the OceanVision project, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster will provide an investment of $6.3 million, while the balance of
the project of $12.5 million will be provided by government agencies, industry partners (Petroleum Research Newfoundland
and Labrador, Nunavut Fisheries Association and NSP Maritime Link Incorporated) and Kraken. Kraken’s commitment to the
project is $4.7 million, of which $2.1 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2021.

FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS AWARDED
At December 31, 2021, Kraken had $11.4 million remaining in grant funding to be offset against research and development
activities of which cash of $3.6 million has been received for projects to be completed during 2022. This excludes the remaining
$3.6 million of funding to be received under the OceanVision™ project.
Significant components of this remaining funding are as follows:
In August 2020, the Company was awarded $2.9 million funding from the National Research Council of Canada Industrial
Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP). This funding is being used to support research and development of Kraken’s
Thunderfish® XL Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and is also part of Kraken’s OceanVision™ project of which $1.1
million has been received.
In August 2021, PanGeo was awarded $2.0 million in funding from the Ocean Supercluster for its development for its GeoScan
Wide Area Acoustic Corer of which $0.1 million has been received.
In November 2021, Kraken was awarded $2.3 million in funding from the Newfoundland Offshore Oil and Gas Industry
Recovery Assistance (OOGIRA) Fund for the development of its Fast Remote 3D Digital Inspection (FR3DI) Technology
Demonstration project of which $1.1 million has been received.
Also in November 2021, PanGeo was awarded $4.8 million in funding from the Newfoundland Offshore Oil and Gas Industry
Recovery Assistance (OOGIRA) Fund for the development of its GeoTrac project of which $2.4 million has been received.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company is a relatively new company with limited operating history and, in addition to facing all of the competitive risks
in the underwater sonar and robotics sector it will face all the risks inherent in developing a business including: access to
capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and maintain customers and the ability to put in
place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;


                                                              10
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

With the outbreak of coronavirus, specifically identified as ‘‘COVID-19’’, there has been significant economic volatility and
supply change disruption. In addition, the geopolitical risk currently being experienced may cause continued economic
volatility and impact on the supply change. It is not possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of these developments
and the impact on the financial results and condition of the Corporation and its operating subsidiaries in future periods. During
the year the company experienced minor delays in procuring components and conducting sea trials. The company received
government assistance under the CEWS (Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy) program as disclosed in Note 19.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities, contingent consideration, and long-term
obligations. The Company will make adjustment to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial
position and performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback
shares or pay dividends, issue debt or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at December 31, 2021, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are
summarized below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                      December 31, 2021                   December 31, 2020
      Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash                        $   6,754,299                      $   13,982,491
      Trade and other receivables                                              6,094,656                           2,595,731
      Contract assets                                                          2,698,757                             524,189


At December 31 2021, 47% of the trade receivables balance was owing from two customers (2020 – 63% of the trade
receivables was owing from two customers). At December 31, 2021 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of
$4,638,786 (2020 – $8,761,477).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. As of December 31, 2021,
the Company had a cash balance of $6,754,299 (December 31, 2020 - $12,924,509), and positive working capital(1) of
$6,364,172. The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent on the Company’s future generation of
cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations with payments to be received in advance
to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet
its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain
additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At December 31, 2021, the Company held $6,754,299 in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and has drawn
          $4,270,000, $578,116 and $95,000 against its operating lines of credit. The drawn operating line of credit bears
          interest annually at bank prime plus 2.5%, 3.95% and bank prime plus 2.5% respectively, payable monthly.
          The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit balance.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.




                                                                12
Fair Value:
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified
assets and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate the carrying
amounts.
    The following table provides the disclosures of the fair value and the level in the hierarchy:
      December 31, 2021                                                     Level 1                Level 2           Level 3

           Trade and other payables                                                     -          10,667,352                  -

USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     (a) PanGeo has received a non-interest bearing repayable loan from Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) in
         the amount of $295,125, this amount will be claimed throughout 2022 with $21,206 currently outstanding.
         Repayment of the loan will be made in monthly installments beginning June 1, 2023 through May 1, 2027.

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PROOUNCMENTS:

    (a) The IASB issued the following standards that have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial
        statements as their effective dates fall within annual periods beginning subsequent to the current reporting period.
        The company intends to adopt these standards, amendments and interpretations when they become effective.

        Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)

        On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, to clarify the
        classification of liabilities as current or non-current. On July 15, 2020 the IASB issued an amendment to defer the
        effective date by one year. The amendments removed the requirement for a right to defer settlement or roll over
        of a liability for at least twelve months to be unconditional. Instead such a right must have substance and exist at
        the end of the reporting period. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
        2023. Early adoption is permitted. The extent of the impact of the change has not yet been determined.

        Property, Plant and Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16)

        On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued Property, Plant and Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments
        to IAS 16). The amendments clarify that proceeds from selling items before the related item of Property, Plant and
        Equipment is available for use should be recognised in profit or loss, together with the cost of producing those
        items. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Early adoption is
        permitted. The extent of the impact of the change has not yet been determined.

        Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37)

        On May 14, 2020, the IASB issued Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37). This
        amendment clarifies which costs are included as a cost of fulfilling a contract when determining whether a
        contract is onerous. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 and
        apply to contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied. Early adoption is permitted. The
        extent of the impact of the change has not yet been determined.




                                                            14
          Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)

          On May 7, 2021, the IASB issued Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
          (Amendments to IAS 12). The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption so that is does
          not apply to the transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. The amendments are
          effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The extent of the
          impact of the change has not yet been determined.

          Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)

          On February 12, 2021 the IASB issued Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8). The amendments
          introduce a new definition for accounting estimates, clarifying that they are monetary amounts in the financial
          statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The amendments also clarify the relationship between
          accounting policies and accounting estimates by specifying that a company develops an accounting estimate to
          achieve the objective set out by an accounting policy. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning
          on or after January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The extent of the impact of the change has not yet been
          determined.

     (b) The following amended IFRS pronouncements were adopted effective January 1, 2020 and had no impact to the
         Company’s financial statements:

          IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Estimates and Errors

          On October 31, 2018, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS
          8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. These amendments clarify the definition of
          ‘material’ and aligns the definition used within the IFRS Standards. The effective date of the amendment is for
          annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and is to be applied prospectively.

          IFRS 3 – Business Combinations

          On October 22, 2018 the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations to narrow the definition of a
          business and introduce a screening test, which eliminates the requirement for a detailed assessment of the
          definition, when met. The effective date of the amendment is for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
          2020 and is to be applied prospectively.


NON-GAAP MEASURES
Non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios not recognized under IFRS are provided
where management believes they assist the reader in understanding Kraken’s results. The Company utilizes the following
terms for measurement within the MD&A that do not have a standardized meaning or definition as prescribed by IFRS and
therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined at Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
