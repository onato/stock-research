3D AT DEPTH ACQUISITION

On April 1, 2025, the Company, through its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the
assets of 3D at Depth, Inc. (“3D at Depth”), a privately held company headquartered in Colorado, USA, specializing in advanced
subsea LiDAR laser scanning and data services for offshore energy, defense, and scientific applications. The total purchase
consideration was $23.5 million, comprised of cash on closing and the assumption of certain liabilities and subject to customary
working capital adjustments.
The acquisition of 3D at Depth expands Kraken’s presence in the United States, adds a proven and complementary technology
to our product and services portfolio, and enhances our capacity to deliver integrated subsea survey and inspection solutions.
3D at Depth’s proprietary LiDAR technology offers sub-millimeter accuracy for subsea metrology, which, when combined with
Kraken’s existing sonar, sub-bottom, and robotics platforms, will enable broader service offerings to our offshore energy and
defense customers. The acquisition also provides access to a highly experienced technical and operations team as well as an
established customer base.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under IFRS 3, Business Combinations. The purchase price
allocation (“PPA”) is preliminary and subject to change as the Company finalizes the fair value assessment of the acquired
assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. As at September 30, 2025, the provisional allocation
resulted in the recognition of intangible assets related to technology, customer relationships, and trademarks, as well as
goodwill reflecting expected synergies.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Consolidated revenue in Q3 2025 increased 60% to $31,298 (Q3 2024 - $19,550). Revenue in the quarter was driven by
continued growth in our subsea battery business, organic growth within our service business and the acquisition of 3D at
Depth. Consolidated revenue for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2025, increased 17% to $73,816 (2024 -
$63,183) as growth seen in our subsea battery and services businesses was offset by lower product revenue in the current
year from our RMDS project and the timing of KATFISH™ projects. Adjusted EBITDA 1 in Q3 2025 was $7,979 (Q3 2024 – $4,148),
while Adjusted EBITDA1 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, was $15,447 (2024 – $13,693).
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.

Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our SAS, KATFISH™ systems and subsea battery systems.
Product revenue in Q3 2025 increased 46% to $18,258 (Q3 2024 - $12,492). Product revenue growth in the quarter was driven
by our revenue from subsea battery systems and SAS. Product revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025,
decreased 8% to $43,966 (2024- $47,755). For the nine-month period, revenue from subsea battery system and SAS grew at a
significant pace, while revenue from RMDS was lower in the current year due to the near completion of the project and
KATFISHTM revenue was lower due to timing of projects.

Kraken’s service business consists of a robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our Sub-Bottom Imager™,
Acoustic Corer™, KATFISHTM, SeaVision and subsea LIDAR imaging.
Service revenue in Q3 2025 increased 85% to $13,040 (Q3 2024- $7,058) due to the acquisition of 3D at Depth, organic growth
in our Sub-Bottom Imager™ business offset by lower Acoustic Acoustic Corer™ revenue compared to the prior year. Service
revenue in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, increased 93% to $29,850 (2024 - $15,428) due to a high
utilization of Sub-Bottom Imager™ assets, the addition of 3D at Depth offset by lower Acoustic Corer™ revenue.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of products based on shipments and the cost of delivery of services revenue as well as
the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged in product and services activities.
Cost of sales in the quarter were $12,719 (Q3 2024 - $9,293), an increase due to higher revenue in the quarter as well as a
change of revenue mix. During Q3 2025, the Company realized gross profit of $18,579 (Q3 2024 – $10,257) resulting in a gross
profit margin of 59% compared to 52% in Q3 2024. The increase in gross profit margin is due to revenue mix, with a higher
percentage of revenue coming from higher margin products and services in the quarter compared to the prior year.
Cost of sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 were $30,357 (2024 - $31,973). As a result, gross profit in
year ended September 30, 2025 increased to $43,459 (2024 - $31,210). Gross profit margin year-to-date was 59% compared
to 49% for the comparable period and increased due an improved mix of higher margin products and service year-to-date.
Administration Expenses
Administration expenses in Q3 2025, excluding transaction and restructuring costs, increased to $8,503 (Q3 2024 - $4,464)
with the increase due in part from the acquisition of 3D at Depth as well as increased resources to execute on the business
opportunities we see in front of us. At the end of the quarter, Kraken employed 421 employees compared to 272 in the same
period of the prior year. Notable items in the administration expense category include: salaries and benefits expenses of $3,440
(Q3 2024 - $2,161), travel related costs of $788 (Q3 2024 - $435), insurance costs of $394 (Q3 2024- $151), software
subscriptions costs of $802 (Q3 2024 - $512), accounting and legal costs of $739 (Q3 2024 - $192) and office and shop supplies
of $621 (Q3 2024 - $314).
Administration expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, excluding transaction and restructuring costs,
increased to $23,151 compared to $13,605 in the prior year due to the acquisition of 3D at Depth as well as the continued
investment in business development, systems and technology. Notable items in the administration expense category year-to-
date include: salaries and benefits expenses of $10,887 (2024 - $6,433), travel related costs of $2,057 (2024 - $1,069),
insurance costs of $1,133 (2024 - $524), software subscriptions of $2,074 (2024 - $1,485), and accounting and legal costs of
$1,641 (2024- $829).
Transaction and restructuring costs for Q3 2025 were $639 (Q3 2024 - $nil). Year-to-date, transaction and restructuring costs
total $1,886 (2024 - $69).
Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses
R&D expenses in Q3 2025 increased 32% to $2,367 (Q3 2024 - $1,794) in the same period of the prior year, due to the timing
of expenditures on various programs as well as the timing of government assistance which is netted against R&D as well as the
acquisition of 3D at Depth. Investment tax credits (“ITCs”) recoverable increased to $270 (Q3 2024 - $149) related to timing of
scientific research and experimental development activities.
Year-to-date, R&D expenses increased 28% to $5,671 (2024 - $4,428) from the timing of R&D expenditures on various
programs, government assistance and the addition of 3D at Depth. Year-to-date, ITCs were $810 (2024 - $447).
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation in Q3 2025 increased 47% to $1,599 (Q3 2024 - $1,085). For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025,
depreciation increased 36% to $4,361 (2024 - $3,201) due to increased capital expenditures as well as the acquisition of 3D at
Depth. In Q3 2025, amortization of intangible assets increased to $805 (Q3 2024- $345) and increased to $1,961 for the nine-
month period ended September 30, 2025 (2024 - $1,027) in the prior year, due to the additions to intangible assets including
those associated with the acquisition of 3D at Depth.
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation expense increased in Q3 2025 to $646 (Q3 2024 - $414), while year-to-date share-based
compensation increased to $1,722 (2024 - $501), due to the timing of stock option grants.
Financing Costs

Financing costs in Q3 2025 increased to $973 (Q3 2024 - $636) in the same period of the prior year. Year-to-date, financing
costs increased to $2,655 (2024 -$1,583) with the increase due to the amortization of credit facility transaction costs.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company faces competitive risks in the underwater sonar and robotics sector and will face all the risks inherent in
developing a business including: access to capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and
maintain customers and the ability to put in place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – Competition within the market of the Company may reduce its ability to procure future contracts and
     sales. The industry in which the Company operates is competitive. Many of the competitors of the Company are large,
     diversified corporations in the sensor and marine robotics products and services industry. Some of the competitors of
     the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities.
     There can be no assurance that the Company can continue to compete effectively with these companies;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The marine sensor, robotics and battery markets are characterized by rapidly-changing technologies
     and evolving industry standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all, or at reasonable cost. If any of the suppliers fail to meet the needs of the
     Company, it may not have readily available alternatives;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company. The termination of funding for a government program would
     result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program that could have a negative impact on the
     operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

The geopolitical risk currently being experienced globally may cause economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company has experienced in the past minor delays in procuring components.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities, bank indebtedness, and long-term
obligations. The Company will make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial
position and performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback
shares, issue debt or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at September 30, 2025, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are
summarized below:
Credit Risk:
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:
                                                                        September 30, 2025           December 31, 2024
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                    $   126,626                 $    58,518
 Trade and other receivables                                                       29,620                      18,699
 Investment tax credits recoverable                                                  1,054                       1,018
 Long-term investment tax credits recoverable                                        1,817                       1,571
 Current Tax Receivable                                                                 19                           -
 Contract assets                                                                   17,867                      17,707
                                                                                  177,003                   $ 97,513


At September 30, 2025, 65% of the trade receivables were owing from two customers (September 30, 2024 - 95% of trade
receivables were owing from two customers). At September 30, 2025, the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $8,435
(December 31, 2024 – $1,083).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had a cash
balance of $126,626 (December 31, 2024 - $58,518). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent
on the Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations
with payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to
generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At September 30, 2025, the Company has drawn $nil against its operating line of credit in Kraken Power GmbH. The
          drawn operating line of credit bears interest annually at bank prime plus 3.95%, payable monthly. The Company has
          also drawn $14,684 against the term revolving credit facility, which bears interest at bank prime plus margin, payable
          monthly. An increase (decrease) of 1,000 basis points in the interest rate would have increased (decreased the
          Company’s net income by approximately $2. The company has also drawn $6,760 on a term loan of US$5,000 bearing
          interest at bank prime plus margin, repayable in quarterly installments of 3.75% over 5 years. An increase (decrease
          of 1,000 basis points in the interest rate would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net income by
          approximately $1
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:

                                                                       September 30, 2025            December 31, 2024
      Financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency:
         Trade and other payables USD                                              $    6,442                      $     2,473
         Trade and other payables GBP                                                   4,299                              920
         Trade and other payables EUR                                                   2,677                            3,268
         Trade and other payables DKK                                                     152                              129
         Trade and other payables BRL                                                     806                              382
          Long-term debt EUR                                                              193                              503
      Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
         Trade and other receivables USD                                                9,717                            5,944
         Trade and other receivables GBP                                                  392                              427
         Trade and other receivables EUR                                                  185                              336
         Trade and other receivables DKK                                                    4                                4
         Trade and other receivables BRL                                                  212                              373

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in
the exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net income by approximately $728 (2024 - $1,897).

Fair Value:
During the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2025, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and
level 3 classified assets and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate
the carrying amounts.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to
estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities are accounted for
prospectively.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA margin, gross profit, gross profit margin, and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial
measures and non-IFRS ratios, when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an
improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do
not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures
employed by other companies. This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any.
