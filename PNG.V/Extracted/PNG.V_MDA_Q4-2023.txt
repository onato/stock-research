FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Consolidated revenue in Q4 2023 was $28,006 compared to $8,813 in Q4 2022, and $69,581 for 2023, compared to $40,908
for 2022. Revenue was driven by the sale of the continued work on large orders received in Q4 2022 including SeaPowerTM
subsea batteries, Remote Minehunting and Disposal Systems (RMDS) to the Government of Canada and a strong year for the
services business.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Q4 2023 was $5,728 (Q4 2022 – $931) with the increase related to the above noted projects as well as
improved gross margin(1) related to a change in revenue product mix in the quarter over the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA(1)
for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $14,094 (2022 – $4,862), an increase due to revenue volumes and improved gross
margin(1) related to a change in product mix.

Net income for Q4 2023 was $2,584 (Q4 2022 – net loss of $1,270) or $0.01 per share compared to $(0.01) in the prior year.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5,546 compared to net loss of $4,243 for the year ended December
31, 2022 or $0.03 per share compared to $(0.03) in the prior year.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.

Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our AquaPix® MINSAS sensors, KATFISH™ systems, SeaPower™ subsea battery
systems and RMDS. Product revenue in Q4 2023 was $19,646 (Q4 2022 - $5,080), an increase of 287% over the prior year due
to continued work on large orders recently received including SeaPower® subsea batteries, KATFISH™ system and RMDS.
Product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $52,618 (2022- $24,900), an increase of 111% over the prior year
due to the sale of a KATFISH™ to a navy in the Asia-Pacific region and continued work on large orders received in Q4 2022
including SeaPower® subsea batteries, sale of KATFISH™ system to a NATO country, RMDS and strong SAS sales to unmanned
underwater vehicle customers.

Kraken’s service business consists of a robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our Sub-Bottom Imager™,
Acoustic Corer™, KATFISHTM, and SeaVision. Service revenue in Q4 2023 was $8,360 (Q4 2022- $3,733), an increase of 124%
over the prior year due to a large Acoustic Corer™ project that occurred in Q4 of 2023. Service revenue in 2023 increased to
$16,963 from $16,008.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of the costs of material as well as the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged
in product and service activities. Cost of sales in the quarter were $16,262 (Q4 2022 - $4,420). During Q4 2023, the Company
realized gross margin(1) of $11,714 (Q4 2022 - $4,393) resulting in a gross margin percentage(1) of 42% compared to 50% in Q4
2022. The decrease in gross margin percentage(1) reflects a change in product and service revenue mix in the current quarter
compared to the prior year.

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $35,625 (2022 - $23,871). As a result, gross margin(1) in 2023
increased to $33,956 (2022 - $17,037). Gross margin percentage(1) year-to-date was 49% compared to 42% in the prior year
due to change of revenue mix in 2023 compared to 2022 with higher margins compared to the prior year.

Administration Expenses
Administration expenses in Q4 2023 increased 21% to $4,714 (Q3 2022 - $3,887) due to costs associated with growing our
business. Administration expenses include transaction and restructuring costs for Q4 2023 of $nil (Q4 2022 -$204) related to
the acquisition of Kraken Robotics Services as well as increasing efficiency in operations.
Notable items in the administration expenses excluding transaction and restructuring costs by category include: salaries and
benefits expenses which increased 34% to $2,241 (Q4 2022 - $1,678), travel related costs which decreased to $335 (Q4 2022
- $438) due to decreased global travel, software subscriptions which increased to $469 (Q4 2022 - $311), accounting and legal
which increased to $383 (Q4 2023 - $289), and office and shop supplies of $138 (Q4 2022 - $269).
Administration expenses for the year ended excluding transaction and restructuring costs increased by 42% to $17,528 (2022
- $12,364) due to the increased activity across the Company. Year-to-date transaction and restructuring costs were $1,132
compared to $850 in the prior year. At the end of December 2023, Kraken employed 244 employees compared to 211 in the
prior year resulting in higher salaries and benefits. Notable items in the administration expense category include: salaries and
benefits, excluding restructuring costs, which increased to $9,116 (2022 - $6,111) due to decreased government assistance,
travel related costs of $1,566 (2022 - $1,066) and advertising and tradeshows of $483 (2022 - $229) which increased due to
global travel, software subscriptions of $1,450 (2022 - $994), accounting and legal costs which increased to $1,175 (2022-
$810) and office and shop supplies of $642 (2022 - $773).
Research and Development costs
Research and development (R&D) costs in the quarter increased to $1,348 (Q4 2022 - $176) due to the timing of expenditures
on various R&D programs as well as the timing of government assistance which are netted against R&D. Year-to-date, R&D
costs increased to $4,487 (2022 - $1,262) resulting from the timing of expenditures on various R&D programs and government
assistance. Investment tax credits were $76 (2022 - $nil) in the quarter and $1,021 year-to-date (2022 - $634).
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation in the quarter totalled $933 (Q4 2022 - $964), while amortization of intangible assets decreased to $304 (Q4
2022 - $384). Year-to-date, depreciation increased to $3,518 (2022 - $3,236) while amortization of intangible assets decreased
to $1,422 (2022 - $1,545).
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation expense in Q4 2023 was $58 (Q4 2022 - $178), representing the fair value of the options recognized
over the vesting period of the underlying options during the quarter. Year-to-date share-based compensation was $378 (2022
- $797).
Financing Costs

Financing costs in Q4 2023 were $102 (Q4 2022 - $816) and year-to-date financing costs were $1,631 (2022 - $3,261). Both the
quarter and year-to-date amounts declined due to the reduced number of bank guarantees and lower fair value adjustments
on debt and contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of PanGeo Subsea Inc. (now Kraken Robotics Services
Ltd.).

Impairment of goodwill

During Q2 2023, the Company completed a goodwill impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the cash
generating unit (CGU) was determined to be higher than its recoverable amount of $18,765 and an impairment loss of $2,757
(2022 – nil) was recognized. The impairment loss was allocated fully to goodwill, reducing the goodwill included in the Services
segment to $4,120. The recoverable amount of the CGU was based on its value in use determined by discounting the future
cash flows to be generated from continuing use of the CGU. The value in use as at June 30, 2023 was determined similarly to
the December 31, 2022 goodwill impairment test and was based on WACC of 19%, terminal growth rate of 2% and an average
estimated compounded growth rate of 4% from 2024 to 2027.
On December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of the Services CGU goodwill totaled $4,120 (2022 - $6,878) intangibles
with indefinite useful lives with an aggregate carrying amount of $893 (2022 - $893). In performing the discounted cash flow
in the Services CGU, a WACC of 19% was used, a terminal growth rate of 3% and an average estimated compounded growth
rate of 15% from 2024 to 2028. As the recoverable amount of the Services CGU was determined to be greater than the carrying
amount, no impairment loss was recorded Q4 2023.
Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA(1)

Net income in the quarter was $2,584 and comprehensive net income was $2,464, as compared to net loss of $1,270 and
comprehensive net loss of $1,598 for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Q4 2023 was $5,728 (Q4 2022 -
$931) or a 21% Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) compared to a 11% Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) for the same period a year ago. The
change over the prior period was due to the increase in revenue and gross margin(1) for the Company year over year.
Year-to-date, the Company recorded net income of $5,546 and comprehensive income of $5,588 compared to a loss of $4,243
and comprehensive loss of $4,880 for the same period of the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the twelve month period was $14,094 or 20% Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) compared to an adjusted
EBITDA(1) of $5,292 or 13% in the prior year. The increase is from a change in product mix with higher margins year over year.

During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2023, the Company generated cash inflows of $8,427 (December 31,
2022 – cash inflows $5,237) from operating activities. Cash outflows from investing activities were $9,807 versus $3,366 for
the twelve month period of December 31, 2022 which includes a $2,250 payment against contingent consideration in Q1 2023.
Financing activities resulted in outflows of $2,001 (December 31, 2022 – cash outflows $41), including a promissory note
payment of $4,494 including interest in Q3 2023.
Overall, excluding the foreign exchange impact, for the twelve month period cash decreased by $3,381 to $5,173 (2022 –
$8,265).

No cash dividends have been declared or paid since the date of incorporation and the Company has no present intention of
paying dividends on its common shares. The Company anticipates that all available funds will be used to finance the growth of
its business.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company is a relatively new company with limited operating history and, in addition to facing all of the competitive risks
in the underwater sonar and robotics sector it will face all the risks inherent in developing a business including: access to
capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and maintain customers and the ability to put in
place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

                 Measures” section of this MD&A.
The geopolitical risk currently being experienced may cause continued economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company experienced minor delays in procuring components and conducting sea trials.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities and long-term obligations. The Company will
make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial position and performance. In order
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback shares or pay dividends, issue debt
or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at December 31, 2023, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are
summarized below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                       December 31, 2023           December 31, 2022
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                    $     5,173                 $     8,265
 Trade and other receivables                                                      10,382                      12,221
 Contract assets                                                                    9,880                       4,347
                                                                               $ 25,435                    $ 24,833


At December 31, 2023, 70% of the trade receivables balance was owing from two customers (Q4 2022 – 52% of the trade
receivables balance was owing from two customers). At December 31, 2023 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of
$10,848 (2022 – $11,817).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a cash
balance of $5,173 (December 31, 2022 - $8,265). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent on
the Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations with
payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to generate
sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At December 31, 2023, the Company has drawn $7,824, $717 and $1,110 against its operating lines of credit. The
          drawn operating line of credit bears interest annually at bank prime plus 2.5%, 3.95% and bank prime plus 2.5%
          respectively, payable monthly.
          The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit balance.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:
                                                                                December 31, 2023           December 31, 2022
       Financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency:
          Trade and other payables USD                                                    $    2,237                    $     581
          Trade and other payables GBP                                                         2,831                        1,381

          Trade and other payables BRL                                                           462                          241

       Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
          Trade and other receivables USD                                                      2,419                        4,697
          Trade and other receivables GBP                                                      3,365                        2,072
          Trade and other receivables EUR                                                      1,027                          473
          Trade and other receivables DKK                                                          6                            6
          Trade and other receivables BRL                                                      1,475                           21

    For the year ended December 31, 2023, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in the
    exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
    would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net income (loss) by approximately $1,025 (2022 - $245).


Fair Value:
     During the period ended December 31, 2023, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified assets
     and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate the carrying
     amounts.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:
    Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company:
     (a) had stock options totaling 1,000,000 exercised, for proceeds of $500.
     (b) entered into a new standby letter of credit to its customer in the amount of US$837 ($1,109) with an expiry of August
         31, 2024.

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS


     (a) The IASB issued the following standards that have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial
         statements as their effective dates fall within annual periods beginning subsequent to the current reporting
         period. The Company intends to adopt these standards, amendments and interpretations when they become
         effective. While under review, the Company does not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised
         standards will have a material impact on our reported financial results.

          Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)

          The amendments to IAS 1 specify the conditions which exist at the end of the reporting period are those which will
          be used to determine if a right to defer settlement of a liability exists. The amendments are effective for annual
          reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and are to be applied retrospectively.

          Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)

          The amendments to IAS 1 specify that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the
          reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. In addition, an entity has to disclose
          information in the notes that enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that non-current
          liabilities with covenants could become repayable within twelve months. The amendments are effective for annual
          reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and are to be applied retrospectively.


     (b) The following amended IFRS pronouncements were adopted effective January 1, 2023 and had no impact to the
         Company’s financial statements:

          Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)

          On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, to clarify the
          classification of liabilities as current or non-current. On July 15, 2020 the IASB issued an amendment to defer the
          effective date by one year. The amendments removed the requirement for a right to defer settlement or roll over of
          a liability for at least twelve months to be unconditional. Instead such a right must have substance and exist at the
          end of the reporting period. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
          Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)

          On May 7, 2021, the IASB issued Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
          (Amendments to IAS 12). The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption so that is does not
          apply to the transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. The amendments are effective
          for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

          Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)

          On February 12, 2021 the IASB issued Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8). The amendments
          introduce a new definition for accounting estimates, clarifying that they are monetary amounts in the financial
          statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The amendments also clarify the relationship between
          accounting policies and accounting estimates by specifying that a company develops an accounting estimate to
          achieve the objective set out by an accounting policy. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning
          on or after January 1, 2023.


NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA margin, gross margin and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial measures and non-
IFRS ratios, when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to
evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do not have any
standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by
other companies. This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined at Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
