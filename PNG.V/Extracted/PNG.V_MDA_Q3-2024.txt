FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.

Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our AquaPix® MINSAS sensors, KATFISH™ systems, SeaPower™ subsea battery
systems and RMDS. Product revenue in Q3 2024 decreased 27% to $12,492 compared to $17,151 in the prior year. The decline
compared to the comparable quarter related primarily to lower KATFISH and RMDS revenue with subsea power revenue
increasing significantly in the quarter.

Product revenue for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024 increased 45% to $47,755 compared to $32,972 in the
prior year. Year-to-date, revenue increased due to the sale of a KATFISH™ to a navy in the Asia-Pacific region and continued
work on large orders received including SeaPower® subsea batteries, sale of KATFISH™ system to a NATO country and RMDS
to the Government of Canada.
Kraken’s service business consists of services provided by robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our Sub-
Bottom Imager™, Acoustic Corer™ and KATFISHTM. Service revenue in Q3 2024 increased 121% to $7,058 compared to $3,191
in the prior year due to an increase in demand for equipment in the marine construction industry. Service revenue for the
nine-month period increased 79% to $15,428 compared to $8,603 in the prior year.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of products based on shipments and the cost of delivery of services revenue as well as
the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged in product and services activities. Cost of sales in the quarter were
$9,293 (Q3 2023 - $10,347) and has decreased due to lower product revenue in the quarter. During Q3 2024, the Company
realized gross profit of $10,257 (Q3 2023 – $9,995) resulting in a gross profit margin of 52% compared to 49% in Q3 2023. The
increase in gross profit margin relates to higher margin projects in the quarter when compared to the prior year.
Cost of sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were $31,973 (2023 - $19,333). As a result, gross profit in
year-to-date increased to $31,210 (2023 - $22,242). Gross profit margin year-to-date was 49% compared to 53% for the
comparable period. Gross profit margin declined on a year-to-date basis due to lower margin product revenue recognized in
the first half of the year.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company faces competitive risks in the underwater sonar and robotics sector and will face all the risks inherent in
developing a business including: access to capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and
maintain customers and the ability to put in place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

The geopolitical risk currently being experienced globally may cause economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company has experienced in the past minor delays in procuring components.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities, bank indebtedness, and long-term
obligations. The Company will make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial
position and performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback
shares, issue debt or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at September 30, 2024, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are
summarized below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                        September 30, 2024           December 31, 2023
 Cash                                                                            $ 14,936                   $     5,173
 Trade and other receivables                                                           9,432                    10,382
 Contract assets                                                                     19,368                       9,880
                                                                                 $ 43,763                   $ 25,435


At September 30, 2024, 95% of the trade receivables were owing from two customers (December 31, 2023 - 79% of trade
receivables were owing from two customers). At September 30, 2024 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $5,041
(December 31, 2023 – $10,848).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash
balance of $14,936 (December 31, 2023 - $5,173). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent
on the Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations
with payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to
generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At September 30, 2024, the Company has drawn $518 against its operating line of credit in Kraken Power GmbH.
          The drawn operating line of credit bears interest annually at bank prime plus 3.95%, payable monthly. The Company
          has also drawn $14,684 against the term revolving credit facility, which bears interest at bank prime plus margin,
          payable monthly. An increase (decrease) of 1,000 basis points in the interest rate would have increased (decreased
          the Company’s net income by approximately $68.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:

                                                                       September 30, 2024            December 31, 2023
      Financial liabilities denominated in a foreign currency:
         Trade and other payables USD                                                   8,342                      $     2,237
         Trade and other payables GBP                                                     595                            2,831
         Trade and other payables EUR                                                   4,853                            1,695
         Trade and other payables DKK                                                   1,511                               93
         Trade and other payables BRL                                                     654                              462
          Long-term debt EUR                                                              383                              770

      Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
         Trade and other receivables USD                                                1,646                            2,419
         Trade and other receivables GBP                                                2,250                            3,365
         Trade and other receivables EUR                                                1,038                            1,027
         Trade and other receivables DKK                                                    5                                6
         Trade and other receivables BRL                                                  485                            1,475

    For the period ended September 30, 2024, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in the
     exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
     would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net income by approximately $1,897 (September 30, 2023 - $1,066).

Fair Value:
During the three-months and six-months ended September 30, 2024, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and
level 3 classified assets and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate
the carrying amounts.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to
estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities are accounted for
prospectively.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA margin and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios,
when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate
the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do not have any standardized
meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies.
This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined at adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
