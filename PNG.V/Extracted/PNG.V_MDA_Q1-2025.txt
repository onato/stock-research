FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Consolidated revenue in Q1 2025 was $16,128 compared to $20,875 in Q1 2024. Revenue in the quarter saw services revenue
increase 38%, while product revenue declined 42% due to lower revenues related to the RMDS program. Adjusted EBITDA 1 in
Q1 2025 was $2,794 (Q1 2024 – $4,101), due to lower product revenue. Net income for Q1 2025 was $215 (Q1 2024 – $2,175)
or $0.00 per share compared to $0.01 in the prior quarter.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.

Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our SAS, KATFISH™ systems and subsea battery systems.
Product revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 decreased 42% to $9,162 (2024 - $15,809). Revenue from batteries
continued to grow at a robust pace in the quarter, while revenue from KATFISHTM and RMDS were lower on a quarter-over-
quarter basis.

Kraken’s service business consists of a robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our Sub-Bottom Imager™,
Acoustic Corer™, KATFISHTM, and SeaVision. Service revenue in Q1 2025 increased 38% to $6,966 (Q1 2024 - $5,066), due to a
high utilization of the Sub-Bottom Imager™ assets.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of products based on shipments and the cost of delivery of services revenue as well as
the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged in product and services activities. Cost of sales in the quarter were
$6,010 (Q1 2024 - $11,529), a decrease compared to Q1 2024 due to lower product sales in the quarter. During Q1 2025, the
Company realized gross profit of $10,118 (Q1 2024 – $9,346) resulting in a gross profit margin 4 of 63% compared to 45% in Q1
2024. The increase in gross profit margin relates to higher margin projects in the quarter when compared to the prior quarter.
The gross profit margin includes a write down on accounts receivable in the amount of $1,459 relating to a customer that went
into administration. The Company does not expect any further impact to its cash flows or earnings as a result of this event.

     sales. The industry in which the Company operates is competitive. Many of the competitors of the Company are large,
     diversified corporations in the sensor and marine robotics products and services industry. Some of the competitors of
     the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities.
     There can be no assurance that the Company can continue to compete effectively with these companies;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The marine sensor, robotics and battery markets are characterized by rapidly-changing technologies
     and evolving industry standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all, or at reasonable cost. If any of the suppliers fail to meet the needs of the
     Company, it may not have readily available alternatives;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company. The termination of funding for a government program would
     result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program that could have a negative impact on the
     operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

The geopolitical risk currently being experienced globally may cause economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company has experienced in the past minor delays in procuring components.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities, bank indebtedness, and long-term
obligations. The Company will make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial
position and performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback
shares, issue debt or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at March 31, 2025, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are summarized
below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                             March 31, 2025          December 31, 2024
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                         $ 59,272                $    58,518
 Trade and other receivables                                                          16,277                    18,699
 Investment tax credits recoverable                                                     1,167                     1,018
 Long-term investment tax credits recoverable                                           1,690                     1,571
 Contract assets                                                                      17,930                    17,707
                                                                                   $ 96,336                  $ 97,513


At March 31, 2025, 79% of the trade receivables were owing from two customers (December 31, 2024 - 72% of trade
receivables were owing from two customers). At March 31, 2025 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $10,900
(December 31, 2024 – $1,083).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had a cash balance
of $59,272 (December 31, 2024 - $58,518). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent on the
Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations with
payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to generate
sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At March 31, 2025, the Company has drawn $nil against its operating lines of credit. An increase (decrease) of 10%
          in interest would have (decreased) increased the Company’s net income by approximately $nil. The Company has
          also drawn $14,684 against the term revolving credit facility, which bears interest at bank prime plus margin, payable
          monthly. An increase (decrease) of 1,000 basis points in the interest rate would have increased (decreased) the
          Company’s net income by approximately $95. The Company has drawn $453 against the revolving capital
          expenditure facility. An increase (decrease of 1,000 basis points in the interest rate would have increased
          (decreased) the Company’s net income by approximately $1.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:

                                                                           March 31, 2025           December 31, 2024
      Financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency:
         Trade and other payables USD                                                  1,065                            2,473
         Trade and other payables GBP                                                    509                              920
         Trade and other payables EUR                                                  2,848                            3,268
         Trade and other payables DKK                                                    143                              129
         Trade and other payables BRL                                                    452                              382
          Long-term debt EUR                                                             288                              503
      Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
         Trade and other receivables USD                                               6,229                            5,944
         Trade and other receivables GBP                                               3,754                              427
         Trade and other receivables EUR                                                 115                              336
         Trade and other receivables DKK                                                   4                                4
         Trade and other receivables BRL                                                 139                              373

For the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2025, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in
the exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net income by approximately $864 (2024 - $107).

Fair Value:
During the three-months and quarter ended March 31, 2025, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3
classified assets and liabilities.
The fair value of the long-term obligations is $17,340 and the valuation uses level 2 inputs using a discounted cash flow
valuation technique.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to
estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities are accounted for
prospectively.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA margin, gross profit, gross profit margin, and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial
measures and non-IFRS ratios, when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an
improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do
not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures
employed by other companies. This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
