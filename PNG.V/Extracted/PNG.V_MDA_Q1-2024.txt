                              (Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated)

This Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Kraken Robotics Inc. (the “Company” or “Kraken”) provides analysis of
the Company’s financial results for the three-month period ending March 31, 2024 and should be read in conjunction with the
Company’s audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are available on
SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com. This MD&A is current as at May 28, 2024, the date of preparation.
The March 31, 2024 condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements. These financial statements
were prepared using the same accounting policies and methods of computation, and are subject to the same use of estimates
and judgments, as the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. These condensed
consolidated interim financial statements do not include all disclosures required by IFRS for annual consolidated financial
statements and accordingly should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2023 prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”). All amounts are expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.
Non-IFRS Measures
This MD&A also includes certain figures that are not performance measures consistent with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These measures are defined at the
end of this MD&A under the heading “Non-IFRS Measures”.

of large orders including SeaPowerTM subsea batteries, Remote Minehunting and Disposal Systems (RMDS) to the Government
of Canada and multiple projects in our service business. Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Q1 2024 was $4,101 compared to $903 for the
same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) was 20% compared to 12% in the prior year.
      1.       Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-IFRS ratio, in each case
               with no standard meaning under IFRS, and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other
               issuers. Refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” section of this MD&A.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.
Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our AquaPix® MINSAS sensors, KATFISH™ systems, and SeaPower™ subsea
battery systems. Product revenue in Q1 2024 was $15,809 (Q1 2023 - $5,328) an increase of 197%. Revenue in Q1 2024 was
generated from the Royal Canadian Navy Minehunting program, sale of subsea batteries, and KATFISHTM systems.

Kraken’s services business consists of services provided by robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our
Sub-Bottom Imager™, Acoustic Corer™ and KATFISHTM. Services revenue in Q1 2024 was $5,066 (Q1 2023 - $2,250) an
increase of 125% over the prior year due to increased activity in the industry. The increase is due to the increased demand
from customers in depth of burial campaigns, geohazards and unexploded ordinances identification.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales reflects the recognition of products based on shipments and the cost of delivery of services revenue as well as
the allocation of wages of employees primarily engaged in product and services activities. Cost of sales in the quarter were
$11,529 (Q1 2023 - $3,075) and has increased due to the growth in our product and service revenue. During Q1 2024, the
Company realized gross margin of $9,346 (Q1 2023 – $4,503) resulting in a gross margin percentage of 45% compared to 59%
in Q1 2023. The decrease in gross margin percentage reflects a change in product and service revenue mix in the current
quarter compared to the prior year.
Administration Expenses
Administration expenses in Q1 2024 increased 35% to $4,524 (Q1 2023 - $3,360) due to costs associated with growing our
business. At the end of the quarter, Kraken employed 250 employees compared to 224 in the prior year. Notable items in the
administration expense category include: salaries and benefits expenses of $2,315 (Q1 2023 - $1,627), travel related costs of
$298 (Q1 2023 - $534), software subscriptions costs of $441 (Q1 2023 - $235), accounting and legal costs of $215 (Q1 2023 -
$189) and office and shop supplies of $232 (Q1 2023 - $214).
Transaction and restructuring costs for Q1 2024 were $69 (Q1 2023 -$35).
Research and Development (R&D)
R&D costs in the quarter increased to $939 (Q1 2023 - $774), due to the timing of expenditures on various R&D programs as
well as the timing of government assistance which is netted against R&D. Investment tax credits recoverable decreased to
$149 (Q1 2023 - $499) related to timing of scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) activities.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased in the quarter due to the increased fixed asset base. Depreciation in the quarter
totalled $1,103 (Q1 2023 - $873), while amortization of intangible assets decreased to $322 (Q1 2023 - $390).
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation expense in Q1 2024 was $57 (Q1 2023 - $161), representing the fair value of the options amortized
over the vesting period of the underlying options during the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Financing Costs

Financing costs in Q1 2024 were $388 (Q1 2023 - $553) with the decline mainly related to lower financing costs associated
with the contingent consideration and promissory note which was paid out in 2023.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company faces competitive risks in the underwater sonar and robotics sector and will face all the risks inherent in
developing a business including: access to capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and
maintain customers and the ability to put in place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

The geopolitical risk currently being experienced may cause continued economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company experienced minor delays in procuring components and conducting sea trials.
An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities, contingent consideration, and long-term
obligations. The Company will make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial
position and performance. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback
shares or pay dividends, issue debt or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at March 31, 2024, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are summarized
below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                        March 31, 2024         December 31, 2023
                                                                           (unaudited)
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                   $    1,527                  $   5,173
 Trade and other receivables                                                    10,741                      10,382
 Contract assets                                                                10,191                       9,880
                                                                              $ 22,459                    $ 25,435
At March 31 2024, 72% of the trade receivables balance was owing from two customers (2023 – 70% of the trade receivables
was owing from two customers). At March 31, 2024 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $6,717 (2023 – $10,848).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. As of March 31, 2024, the
Company had a cash balance of $1,527 (December 31, 2023 - $5,173). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come
due is dependent on the Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage
contract negotiations with payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company
will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the
Company to generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At March 31, 2024, the Company held $1,527 in cash and has drawn $7,365, $717 and $1,420 against its operating
          lines of credit. The drawn operating lines of credit bear interest annually at bank prime plus 2.5%, 3.95% and bank
          prime plus 2.5% respectively, payable monthly. An increase (decrease) of 1,000 basis points in the interest rate would
          have increased (decreased) the Company’s net loss by approximately $11.
          The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit balance.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:
                                                                             March 31, 2024           December 31, 2023
      Financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency:
         Trade and other payables USD                                               $ 5,450                         $     2,237
         Trade and other payables GBP                                                 1,061                               2,831
         Trade and other payables EUR                                                 4,443                               1,695
         Trade and other payables DKK                                                 2,458                                  93

          Long-term debt EUR                                                            478                                 770
          Bank indebtedness EUR                                                         492                                 543
      Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
         Trade and other receivables USD                                                2,446                             2,419
         Trade and other receivables GBP                                                1,548                             3,365
         Trade and other receivables EUR                                                  270                             1,027
         Trade and other receivables DKK                                                    -                                 6
         Trade and other receivables BRL                                                1,511                             1,475

    For the period ended March 31, 2024, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in the
    exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
    would have (decreased) increased the Company’s net loss by approximately $1,884 (2023 – increased (decreased) net loss
    by approximately $1,025).

Fair Value:
During the three-months ended March 31, 2024 there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified assets
and liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate the carrying amounts.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA margin and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios,
when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate
the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do not have any standardized
meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies.
This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined at adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
