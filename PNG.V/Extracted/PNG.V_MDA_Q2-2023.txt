                              (Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated)

This Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Kraken Robotics Inc. (the “Company” or “Kraken”) provides analysis of
the Company’s financial results for the three and six-month period ending June 30, 2023 and should be read in conjunction with
the Company’s audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are available
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. This MD&A is current as at August 28, 2023, the date of preparation.
The June 30, 2023 condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements. These financial statements
were prepared using the same accounting policies and methods of computation and are subject to the same use of estimates
and judgments, as the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the exception
of revenue recognition as the Company changed its revenue recognition for its battery products from point in time to over time
using the input cost method. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all disclosures required
by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for annual consolidated financial statements and accordingly should be
read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022
prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). All amounts are
expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Consolidated revenue in Q2 2023 was $13,655 compared to $14,292 in Q2 2022, and $21,233 for the six month period ended
June 30, 2023, compared to $19,804 for the six month period ended June 30, 2022. Revenue in the quarter was driven by the
sale of a KATFISH™ to a navy in the Asia-Pacific region and continued work on large orders received in Q4 2022 including
SeaPower® subsea batteries, sale of KATFISH™ system to a NATO country and Remote Minehunting and Disposal Systems
(RMDS) to the Government of Canada.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Q2 2023 was $3,040 (Q2-2022 $2,984) for the same period in the prior year with the increase related to
improved gross margin related to a change in product mix in the quarter over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the six
month period ended June 30, 2023 was $3,943 (2022 -$2,616) and also increased from improved gross margin related to a
change in product mix.

During the quarter, Kraken derecognized the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of PanGeo
by $4,044, which had a positive impact on net income. Net income for Q2 2023 was $1,997 (Q2-2022 -$514) or $0.01 per share
compared to $0.00 in the prior year. Net income for the six-month period ending June 30, 2023 was $661 compared to net
loss of $2,045 for the six month period ending June 30, 2022.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Revenue
The Company’s product and service revenue can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of orders, lead
times on part purchases and seasonality.

Kraken’s product business consists primarily of our AquaPix® MINSAS sensors, KATFISH™ systems, SeaPower™ subsea battery
systems and RMDS. Product revenue in Q2 2023 was $10,493 (Q2 2022 - $8,491) and increased 24% over the prior year due
the sale of a KATFISH™ to a navy in the Asia-Pacific region and continued work on large orders received in Q4 2022 including
SeaPower® subsea batteries, sale of KATFISH™ system to a NATO country and Remote Minehunting and Disposal Systems
(RMDS) to the Government of Canada.
Product revenue for the six month period ending June 30, 2023 was $15,821 (2022- $12,217) an increase of 29% over the prior
year due to the sale of a KATFISH™ to a navy in the Asia-Pacific region and continued work on large orders received in Q4 2022
including SeaPower® subsea batteries, sale of KATFISH™ system to a NATO country and Remote Minehunting and Disposal
Systems (RMDS) to the Government of Canada.

Kraken’s services business consists of services provided by robotics as a service (RaaS) portfolio of equipment including our
Sub-Bottom Imager™, Acoustic Corer™, KATFISHTM, and SeaVision. Services revenue in Q2 2023 was $3,162 (Q2 2022- $5,801)
a decrease of 45% over the prior year due to a large Acoustic Corer™ project that occurred in 2022 which did not repeat itself
in 2023. Services in the first six months of 2023 decreased to $5,412 from $7,587 in the prior year due to the non-recurring
Acoustic Corer™ project that occurred in 2022.

Impairment of goodwill

The carrying value of the Services cash generating unit (CGU) was determined to be higher than its recoverable amount of
$18,765 and an impairment loss of $2,757 (2022 – nil) was recognised. The impairment loss was allocated fully to goodwill,
reducing the goodwill included in the Services segment to $4,120. The recoverable amount of the CGU was based on its value
in use.
Value in use was determined by discounting the future cash flows to be generated from the continuing use of the CGU. Value
in use as at June 30, 2023 was determined similarly to the December 31, 2022 goodwill impairment test and was based on a
WACC of 19%, terminal growth rate of 2% and an average estimated compounded growth rate of 4% from 2024 to 2027.
Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA(1)

Net income in the quarter was $1,997 and comprehensive net income of $1,945, as compared to net income of $514 and
comprehensive net income of $560 for the same period of prior year. Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Q2 2023 was $3,040 (Q2-2022
$2,984) or an 22% adjusted EBITDA margin(1) compared to an 21% adjusted EBITDA margin(1) for the same period a year ago.
The change over the prior period was due to the reduction of the fair value of contingent consideration.
Year-to-date the Company recorded net income of $661 and a comprehensive income of $625 compared to a loss of $2,045
and comprehensive loss of $2,024 for the same period of the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the six-month period was $3,943 or 19% Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) compared to an adjusted EBITDA(1)
of $2,616 or 13% in the prior year. The increase is from change in product mix with higher margins year over year.
Refer to Non-GAAP section below for further detail.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At June 30, 2023, the Company had negative working capital of $(1,056) (2022 – ($2,035)). Working capital is negative due to
the promissory note related to Kraken Robotic Services acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents as at June 30, 2023 were $6,716
as compared with $8,265 at December 31, 2022.
During the six-month period ended June 30, 2023, the Company received proceeds of $29 upon the exercise of 72,500 stock
options (June 30, 2022 – proceeds of $nil). During the 3 month period, the Company received proceeds of $9 on the exercise
of 15,000 common share purchase warrants.
During the six-month period ended June 30, 2023, the Company experienced cash inflows of $7,599 (June 30, 2022 – cash
outflows $3,863) from operating activities. Cash outflows from investing activities were $6,558 versus $707 for the 6 month
period of June 30, 2022. Financing activities realized outflows of $2,447 (June 30, 2022 – cash outflows $281).
Overall, excluding the foreign exchange impact on cash, cash decreased by $1,406 to $6,716 (2022 – $8,265).



             1.    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-IFRS ratio, in each
                   case with no standard meaning under IFRS, and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed
                   by other issuers. Refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” section of this MD&A.
A commercial bank issued standby letters of credit on behalf of the Company to customers in the amount of US$3,108
(C$4,120), US$1,960 (C$2,598) and US$830 (C$1,100) on advance guarantees secured by Export Development Canada. The
letters of credit expire on October 30, 2023, November 30, 2023 and October 31, 2024, respectively.
No cash dividends have been declared or paid since the date of incorporation and the Company has no present intention of
paying dividends on its common shares. The Company anticipates that all available funds will be used to finance the growth of
its business.

Financial Contributions Awarded
At June 30, 2023, Kraken had $11.3 million remaining in grant funding to be offset against R&D activities of which cash of $5.5
million has been received for projects to be completed during 2023.
Significant components of this remaining funding are as follows:
In August 2021, Kraken Robotics Services was awarded $2.0 million in funding from the Ocean Supercluster for its development
for its GeoScan Wide Area Acoustic Corer of which $1 million has been received.
In November 2021, Kraken was awarded $2.3 million in funding from the Newfoundland Offshore Oil and Gas Industry
Recovery Assistance (OOGIRA) Fund for the development of its Fast Remote 3D Digital Inspection Technology Demonstration
project. This project completed in December 2022.Also in November 2021, Kraken Robotics Services was awarded $4.8 million
in funding from OOGIRA for the development of its GeoTrac project of which $4.3 million has been received.
In November 2022, Kraken was awarded $8.0 million in funding to its Brazilian subsidiary to continue development on artificial
intelligence, machine learning software and subsea autonomy solutions of which $0.2 has been received.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company is a relatively new company with limited operating history and, in addition to facing all of the competitive risks
in the underwater sonar and robotics sector it will face all the risks inherent in developing a business including: access to
capital, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, ability to attract and maintain customers and the ability to put in
place appropriate operating and control procedures.
Industry specific risks include, but are not limited to:
   • Competitive risk – the sonar industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The competitors of the
     Company range from small single product companies to diversified corporations in the military, sonar and marine
     imaging industry. Some of the competitors of the Company may have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
     manufacturing, and marketing capabilities;
   • Technology risk – The future success of the Company will depend on its ability to develop new technologies that achieve
     market acceptance. The sonar market is characterized by rapidly-changing technologies and evolving industry
     standards;
   • Protection of Intellectual Property: The Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,
     which could affect its ability to compete. Protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to
     compete and succeed as a company. The Company currently has trademark registrations and relies on a combination
     of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures
     to protect its proprietary information. However, all of these measures afford only limited protection;
   • Outside suppliers: The Company’s operations depend on component availability and the manufacture and delivery by
     key suppliers of certain products and services. Further, the Company’s operations are dependent on the timely delivery
     of materials by outside suppliers. The Company cannot be sure that materials, components, and subsystems will be
     available in the quantities required, if at all;
   • Government contracts: The Company will depend, in part, on government contracts, which may only be partially
     funded, subject to termination, heavily regulated, and audited. The termination of one or more of these contracts could
     have a negative impact on the operations of the Company; and
   • Competitive bidding: The Company will derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive
     bidding process, which can impose substantial costs upon it, and the Company could fail to maintain its current and
     projected revenue if it fails to compete effectively.

The geopolitical risk currently being experienced may cause continued economic volatility and impact the supply chain. The
Company experienced minor delays in procuring components and conducting sea trials.

An investment in the Company’s common shares is highly speculative and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Only
those persons who can bear the risk of the entire loss of their investment should participate. An investor should carefully
consider the risks described above and the other information filed with the Canadian securities regulators before investing in
the Company’s common shares. The risks described above are not the only ones faced. Additional risks that the Company
currently believes are immaterial may become important factors that affect the Company’s business. If any of these risks
occur, or if others occur, the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed and
investors may lose all of their investment.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing its capital are to maintain a financial position suitable for supporting its operations
and growth strategies, to provide an adequate return to shareholders and to meet its current obligations.

The Company’s capital structure consists of shareholders’ equity, lease liabilities and long-term obligations. The Company will
make adjustments to the capital structure depending on economic conditions, its financial position and performance. In order
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, buyback shares or pay dividends, issue debt
or sell assets to reduce debt.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As at June 30, 2023, the Company’s risk exposures and the impact of the Company’s financial instruments are summarized
below:
Credit Risk:
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date was:
                                                                             June 30, 2023         December 31, 2022
 Cash and cash equivalents                                                      $     6,716               $     8,265
 Trade and other receivables                                                        13,573                    12,221
 Contract assets                                                                      1,639                     4,347
                                                                                 $ 21,928                  $ 24,833


At June 30, 2023, 79% of the trade receivables balance was owing from two customers (Q2 2022 – 60% of the trade receivables
was owing from two customers). At June 30, 2023 the Company had recorded contract liabilities of $20,488 (2022 – $11,817).
Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had a cash balance
of $6,716 (December 31, 2022 - $8,265). The Company’s ability to meet obligations as they come due is dependent on the
Company’s future generation of cash from operations, ability to obtain financing and to manage contract negotiations with
payments to be received in advance to fulfill contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to meet its contractual obligations as they come due. The failure of the Company to generate
sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional financing could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations.
Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity and equity prices.
     (a) Interest rate risk
          At June 30, 2023, the Company held $6,716 in cash and has drawn $3,386, $559 and $1,260 against its operating
          lines of credit. The drawn operating line of credit bears interest annually at bank prime plus 2.5%, 3.95% and bank
          prime plus 2.5% respectively, payable monthly.
          The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit balance.
     (b) Foreign currency risk
         The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is limited to sales in USD, GBP, EUR, DKK and BRL. The Company
         does not use any form of hedging against fluctuations in foreign exchange.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows:
                                                                                        June 30, 2022       December 31, 2022
       Financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency:
          Trade and other payables USD                                                          2,016                   $     581
          Trade and other payables GBP                                                          1,118                       1,381

          Trade and other payables BRL                                                            255                         241

       Financial assets denominated in a foreign currency:
          Trade and other receivables USD                                                       9,278                       4,697

          Trade and other receivables EUR                                                         999                         473
          Trade and other receivables DKK                                                           8                           6

     For the period ended June 30, 2023, with other variables remaining constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in the
     exchange rate of the US dollar, British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real and Danish Krone to the Canadian dollar exchange rate
     would have increased (decreased) the Company’s net loss by approximately $170 (2022 - $13).
Fair Value:
     During the period ended June 30, 2023, there were no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 classified assets and
     liabilities. The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are considered to approximate the carrying amounts.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are reviewed
on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates on the resulting effects of the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities
are accounted for prospectively.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent to June 30, 2023, the Company:

     (a) had 9,980,000 warrants expire on July 26, 2023.
     (b) paid the Promissory Notes of $4,000 plus $494 interest to the sellers of PanGeo Subsea on July 31, 2023 in cash.

NON-IFRS MEASURES
The Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios in this MD&A, including adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted EBITDA margin and working capital. Management believes that non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios,
when supplementing measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate
the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios do not have any standardized
meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies.
This data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, adjusted EBITDA is useful
to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating operating performance by presenting the results of
the Company on a basis which excludes the impact of certain non-operational items which enables the primary readers of the
MD&A to evaluate the results of the Company such that it was operating without certain non-cash and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring impact transactions, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined at adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Revenue.
