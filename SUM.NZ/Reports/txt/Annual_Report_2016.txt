Underlying profit differs from NZ IFRS net profit after tax. The Directors have provided an unaudited underlying
profit measure to assist readers in determining the realised and non-realised components of fair value movement
of investment property and tax expense in the Group’s income statement. The measure is used internally in
conjunction with other measures to monitor performance and make investment decisions. Underlying profit is
an industry-wide measure which the Group uses consistently across reporting periods.

CHAIRMAN’S REPORT

Welcome to Summerset’s Annual Report for the financial year to 31 December
2016. We report on another year of good performance and a strong set of
annual results. This year we continued to expand our offering around the
country with two land acquisitions, the successful opening of the village
centres at our Wigram and Hobsonville villages, and our first dementia
service, in Levin.
In 2016 Summerset delivered an underlying profit

CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER’S REPORT
The first residents moved into their new homes at
Summerset at Heritage Park in Ellerslie in October,
and we are on track to complete their village centre
and care centre in mid-2017. When completed, the
village will feature a lake with an island, upon which
the bowling green and barbeque facilities will be
located. Our Ellerslie village will have buildings
ranging from two to seven levels with a focus on

With over 4,200 residents, 700 more than last year, growth was a key driver
of Summerset’s performance in 2016. This strengthens our position as New
Zealand’s fastest-growing retirement village and aged care provider.

Plans for our Boulcott, Lower Hutt village are
progressing, though at a slower rate than we would
like. In October 2016, Hutt City Council approved our
application to rezone 2.9 hectares of our Boulcott
site from General Recreational Activity to General
Residential Activity with special provision for a
retirement village. We will continue to work through
this process and hope to lodge a resource consent
application later this year.
In 2016 we purchased two new sites for development.
One site is in Richmond, Nelson and the other in
the Hamilton suburb of Rototuna. These purchases
bring the total number of Summerset locations to 27
nationwide. We have existing villages in Nelson and
Hamilton and have found there is strong demand for
retirement living in these areas.
At the end of 2016, Summerset’s total land bank
represented 2,609 retirement units and 366 care beds.
This is a total of around six years’ supply based on our
intended build programme for retirement units in 2017
of around 450 units.

towards improving our systems and culture with the
ultimate aim of preventing and reducing harm to
employees, residents, contractors and visitors to our
villages. We established a dedicated Health and Safety
function and have implemented a Health and Safety
system to collect incident data and risk assessments.
With guidance and input from our Board, we are
committed to continuing to progress this area in 2017.
To recognise the hard work our caregivers do, and the
important role they play in the lives of our residents, we
implemented a number of initiatives and staff benefits
in 2016, including an annual uniform allowance. In
addition to this, our caregivers, nurses and clinical staff
who work overtime, double or night shifts now enjoy
a meal from their village kitchen or café during their
shift. In 2017, we will be undertaking a review of our
uniform in consultation with the people who wear it
to ensure they are comfortable and supported in their
work. This is an exciting project for us and we are keen
to come up with a stylish and practical design that our
staff will be proud to wear.

apartments, complete with a kitchenette and living
area, giving residents the choice to live in a larger home
if they prefer. It is the first dementia centre in New
Zealand to offer this type of apartment-style living.
Our Levin village was chosen as the location for the
dementia centre because it is an established village
that has been part of the local community for 15 years.
Dementia is a key cause of disability later in life and
the number of people with dementia is expected to
increase in coming years. The centre will ensure people
at our Levin village and the wider community won’t
have to move far if they find themselves requiring this
level of care. We plan to incorporate dementia care
into future villages, with the next facility to be at our
Casebrook village in Christchurch.

Summerset’s simple philosophy

During 2016, Summerset received a Highly Commended
award in the Aged Care and Retirement Villages
category of the annual Reader’s Digest Trusted Brand
awards. We were delighted with the comments from
participants about our villages, including “Summerset
villages are the nicest ones I’ve been to.”

Looking to the future
We are experiencing a period of demographic change
in New Zealand. As one of New Zealand’s largest
retirement village developers and operators, we have
established an offering that sees us develop new
villages efficiently and operate them well. Our focus
will remain on growing the business and refining
and improving how we run our villages.
For shareholders, this should mean continued growth
in earnings. We have discussed our approach to
property market cycles in previous annual reports.
In short, demand for our villages is driven by the
increased number of older New Zealanders and the
value we offer them in that stage of life. This demand
is not driven by the property market. Since opening
our first village almost 20 years ago, Summerset has
seen two property market downturns and during each,
demand for our services remained consistent.
To guard against a downturn, we adopt a prudent
approach to debt levels. All of our debt relates to
development projects. As at 31 December 2016, the
value of our development working capital (being land,
work in progress, and completed homes awaiting
settlement) totalled $307 million. This compared to

In 2016 deferred management fees received have been reclassified from receipts for residents’ loans to net-off the repayment of
residents’ loans. The comparative year has been restated to align to this classification. Other comparative cash flows have been
restated where appropriate to better reflect the nature of the transactions.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(continued)

Accounting policies
Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to the understanding of the financial
statements are provided throughout the accompanying notes.
The accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the periods presented in these financial statements.
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and are not yet effective, that are expected
to have a significant impact on the Group.
The Group adopted all mandatory new and amended NZ IFRS Standards and Interpretations. These new and amended NZ IFRS
Standards and Interpretations had a disclosure impact only on these financial statements.
NZ IFRS Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet effective and have not been
adopted by the Group for the annual report period ending 31 December 2016 are outlined below:
NZ IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers
This standard will replace the current revenue recognition guidance in NZ IAS 18 – Revenue and NZ IAS 11 – Construction
contracts. This standard requires an entity to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. The Group has yet to assess the full impact of this standard, however, the impact of this standard is not expected
to be significant for the Group.
NZ IFRS 16 – Leases
This standard will replace NZ IAS 17 – Leases. NZ IFRS 16 requires a lessee to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease
payments and a ‘right-of-use asset’ for virtually all lease contracts. The Group has yet to assess the full impact of this standard,
however, the impact of this standard is not expected to be significant for the Group.

3 REVENUE
Care fees and villages services income is recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Deferred management fees, which entitle residents to accommodation and the use of the community facilities within the village,
are recognised over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue.
The expected periods of tenure, being based on historical Summerset averages, are estimated to be seven to eight years for villas,
five years for apartments and three years for serviced apartments. Where the deferred management fees over the contractual
period exceeds the amortisation of the deferred management fee based on estimated tenure, the amount is recorded as a liability
(revenue in advance). Deferred management fees are recognised on a gross basis in the receipts for residents’ loans section of the
statement of cashflows.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Remuneration paid to auditors:

Estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The principal areas of judgement
in preparing these financial statements are described in the following notes:

Donations

• Deferred management fee – Note 3
• Interest rate swaps – Note 13
• Revenue in advance – Note 3
• Valuation of investment property – Note 10
• Valuation of land and buildings – Note 8

5 NET FINANCE COSTS

2 SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group operates in one industry, being the provision of integrated retirement villages in New Zealand. The services provided
across all of the Group’s villages are similar, as are the type of customer and the regulatory environment. On this basis, the Group
has one reportable segment, and the Group results are the same as the results of the reportable segment. All resource allocation
decisions across the Group are made to optimise the consolidated Group’s result.
The Ministry of Health is a significant customer of the Group, as the Group derives care fee revenue in respect of eligible
government subsidised aged care residents. Fees earned from the Ministry of Health for the year ended 31 December 2016
amounted to $20.4 million (2015: $16.7 million). No other customers individually contribute a significant proportion of the
Group revenue. All revenue is earned in New Zealand.

Borrowing costs are capitalised for property, plant and equipment (Note 8) and investment property (Note 10) if they are directly
attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the
activities to prepare the asset commence and expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs
continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.

6 INCOME TAX
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax, calculated using the tax rate enacted or substantively enacted at balance date
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement except when it
relates to items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the tax expense is recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax expense is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent it
is probable it will be utilised. Temporary differences for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting
nor taxable profit, unless they arise from business combination, are not provided for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

7 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Trade receivables are not significant on an
individual basis and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate, less an allowance for impairment. Impairment is assessed on an individual basis.

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a diminishing value basis over the estimated useful lives of each item
of property, plant and equipment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated, and buildings which are depreciated
on a straight-line basis. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at the reporting date.
Major depreciation rates are as follows:
Buildings 2%

Motor vehicles 20% to 31%

Furniture and fittings 8% to 40%

Plant and equipment 8% to 67%

Subsequent to initial recognition, land and buildings related to care facilities are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair
value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on buildings and accumulated impairment
losses, if any, since the assets were last revalued. Plant and equipment is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Where an item of plant and equipment is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised
in the income statement is calculated as the difference between the net sales price and the carrying
amount of the asset.
Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence, which is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged
between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction as at the valuation date.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset
previously recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement unless it directly
offsets a previous surplus in the same asset in other comprehensive income. Any accumulated depreciation at revaluation
date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the
asset. Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Independent valuations are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially
from the asset’s fair value at the balance sheet date.

9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Revaluations
An independent valuation to determine the fair value of all completed care facilities which are classified as land and buildings
was carried out as at 31 December 2014 by CBRE Limited, an independent registered valuer. Valuations are carried out every
three years unless there are indicators of a significant change in fair value. CBRE determine the fair value of all care facility
assets using an earnings-based multiple approach. Significant assumptions used in the most recent valuation include market
value per care bed of between $79,000 and $144,000 and individual unit earning capitalisation rate of between 12.25% and 15.5%.

Intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses. Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a diminishing value basis over the estimated useful lives of
intangible assets from the date that they are available for use. The intangible assets are software. The major amortisation
rate is 50%.

value measurement and a significant increase (decrease) in the market value per care bed would result in a significantly higher
(lower) fair value measurement.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(continued)

As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised investment
property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

10 INVESTMENT PROPERTY
Investment properties are held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation. They comprise land and buildings and
associated equipment and furnishings relating to independent living units, serviced apartments and common facilities in
the retirement village. Investment properties include buildings under development. Initial recognition of investment property
is at cost and it is subsequently measured at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in the income statement.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy

Rental income from investment property, being deferred management fees, is accounted for as described in Note 3.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolios of investment property are the discount rate, the long-term nominal house price inflation rate, the average
entry age of residents and the occupancy period of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the discount rate or the occupancy
period of units would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement and a significant increase (decrease) in the
average entry age of residents or the long-term nominal house price inflation rate would result in a significantly higher (lower)
fair value measurement.

Depreciation is not charged on investment property.

Operating expenses

Note 5 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.

Direct operating expenses arising from investment property that generated rental income during the period amounted to $21.9
million (2015: $17.7 million). There were eight retirement units excluding work in progress (2015: 23) in investment property that
did not generate rental income during the period.

Land acquired with the intention of constructing an investment property on it is classified as investment property from the
date of acquisition.

Fair value movement:

Total investment property

The fair value of investment property as at 31 December 2016 was determined by CBRE Limited, an independent registered
valuer. The fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on a semi-annual basis, based on market values, being
the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing buyer and a willing
seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and
without compulsion. To assess the fair value of the Group’s interest in the village, CBRE has undertaken a cashflow analysis to
derive a net present value. There has been no change in valuation technique since the previous period.

long-term nominal house price inflation rate of between 0% and 3.5% (2015: 0% to 3.5%). Other assumptions used by the valuer
include the average entry age of residents and occupancy periods of units.

12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Group has deemed it is unable to reliably determine the fair value of non-land capital work in progress at 31 December 2016
and therefore is carried at cost. This equates to $122.3 million of investment property (2015: $99.5 million).

A provision is made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages, salaries, annual leave and short-term incentives when
it is probable that settlement will be required and the amount can be estimated reliably.

13 INTEREST RATE SWAPS

14 RESIDENTS’ LOANS

The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swaps are initially
recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value on each reporting
date. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined based on cash flows discounted to present value using current
market interest rates.

An occupation right agreement confers a right of occupancy to a villa, apartment or serviced apartment. The consideration
received on the grant of an occupation right agreement is allocated to the resident’s loan in full. Residents’ loans are amounts
payable under occupation right agreements. These loans are non-interest-bearing and are payable when both an occupation
right agreement is terminated and there has been settlement of a new occupation right agreement for the same retirement unit
and the proceeds from the new settlement have been received by the Group. Residents’ loans are initially recognised at fair value
and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

When interest rate swaps meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income
statement. Amounts taken to reserves are transferred out of reserves and included in the measurement of the hedged
transaction when the forecast transaction occurs. When interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge
accounting, all movements in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group has a right to receive interest at variable rates and to pay interest at
fixed rates. At 31 December 2016, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with a total notional principal amount
of $251 million (2015: $236 million). Of the swaps in place, at 31 December 2016 $179 million (2015: $94 million) are being used
to cover approximately 65% (2015: 38%) of the loan principal outstanding. These agreements effectively change the Group’s
interest exposure on the principal covered by the interest rate swaps from a floating rate to fixed rates, which range between
3.54% and 4.47% (2015: 3.15% and 4.47%).
The fair value of these agreements at 31 December 2016 is $4.9 million liability, comprised of $5.8 million of swap liabilities
and $0.9 million swap assets (2015: liability of $3.1 million, comprised of $3.9 million swap liabilities and $0.8 million swap assets).
Of this, a liability of $264,000 (2015: $134,000) is estimated to be current. The agreements cover notional amounts for a term of
between one and ten years.
The notional principal amounts and the period of expiry of the interest rate swap contracts are as follows:

The Group holds a contractual right to set-off the deferred management fee receivable on termination of an agreement against
the resident’s loan to be repaid. Residents’ loans are therefore recognised net of the deferred management fee receivable on
the balance sheet. Deferred management fees are payable by residents in consideration for the supply of accommodation and
the right to share in the use of community facilities. Deferred management fees are paid in arrears with the amount payable
calculated as a percentage of the resident’s loan amount as per the resident’s occupation right agreement. Deferred management
fee receivable is calculated and recorded based on the current tenure of the resident and the contractual right to deferred
management fee earned at balance date. Refer to Note 3 for further detail on recognition of deferred management fee revenue.

15 INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS
As at 31 December 2016, secured bank loans totalled $274.0 million (2015: $248.2 million).
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs, with
any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings
using the effective interest rate basis.
The weighted average interest rate for the year to 31 December 2016 was 3.58% (2015: 3.59%). This includes the impact of interest
rate swaps (see Note 13).
The secured bank loan facility at 31 December 2016 has a maximum of $450.0 million (2015: $450.0 million). Lending of $125.0
million expires in August 2018 and $325.0 million of lending expires in August 2020.
Security
The bank loans are secured by a general security agreement over the assets of Summerset Holdings Limited (a subsidiary of the
Company) subject to a first priority to the Statutory Supervisor over the village assets.

Market risk

16 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board reviews and agrees
on policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below. The Group has no exposure to foreign currency or any other
substantial market price risk.
Categories of financial instruments
All financial assets are classified as loans and receivables except for limited recourse loans which are designated as fair value
through profit or loss and interest rate swaps which are classified as derivatives held for trading. All financial liabilities except
interest rate swaps are classified as liabilities at amortised cost.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a resident or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their
contractual obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk relates to receivables from residents and bank balances. The Group
manages its exposure to credit risk. The Group’s cash is held with its principal banker, with the level of exposure to credit risk
considered minimal with low levels of cash generally held. Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and funds
are placed with high-credit-quality financial institutions. The level of risk associated with sundry debtors is considered minimal.
The Group does not require collateral from its debtors and the Directors consider the Group’s exposure to any concentration of
credit risk to be minimal.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The status of trade receivables is as

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by seeking to obtain the most competitive rate of interest at all times.
The Group has also entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to provide an effective cash flow hedge against the
variability in floating interest rates. See Note 13 for details of the interest rate swap agreements.
At 31 December 2016 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the
Group’s profit before income tax by $2.6 million (2015: decrease by $2.4 million) and decrease total comprehensive income by
approximately $0.9 million (2015: decrease by $1.5 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages
liquidity by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual
cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk on residents’
loans and related sundry debtors through the contractual requirements of occupation rights agreements, whereby a resident’s
loan is only repaid on receipt of the loan monies from the incoming resident.
The following table sets out the contractual cash flows for all financial liabilities for the Group (including contractual interest
obligations on bank loans):

The fair value of residents’ loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Future cash flows are based on the
assumption that the average tenure periods are those disclosed above and have been discounted at 14% (2015: 14%). The fair
value of residents’ loans is categorised as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value
Measurement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined using inputs from third parties that are observable, either directly (i.e. as
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Based on this, the Company and Group has categorised these financial instruments
as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
Capital management
The Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings. The objective of the Group’s capital management is
to ensure a strong credit rating to support business growth and maximise shareholder value. The Group’s capital is managed

The performance hurdles for each grant of shares under the 2013 share plan between 2013 and 2015 to executive team members
(CEO and direct reports) are based on the Group’s total shareholder return relative to the performance of relevant peers and the
NZX 50.
The performance hurdles for the grant of shares under the 2013 share plan in 2016 to executive team members are based on:
• 50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget)
• 25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group)
• 10% employee initiatives
• 10% customer initiatives
• 5% clinical strategy initiatives
There are no performance hurdles for grants of shares to senior management team members other than members of the
executive team, whose hurdles are described above.

Other than in our capacity as auditor we have no relationship with, or interest in, the group.
Partners and employees of our firm may deal with the group on normal terms within the ordinary
course of trading activities of the business of the group.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements on pages 2 to 24 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the group as at 31 December 2015 and the financial performance and cash
flows of the group for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to
International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.

The capitalisation of development costs is considered a
key audit matter as judgement is applied by the group to
identify and measure directly attributable costs. Alternative
judgements could lead to different profit and work in progress
balances being reported in the financial statements.
Summerset records non-land work in progress at cost, as
it has determined it is unable to measure the fair value of
construction whilst in progress. Non-land work in progress
of $123 million, representing 7% of total assets, was included
in the balance of Investment Property as described in Note 10
Investment Property to the consolidated financial statements.
The balance of work in progress carried at cost is tested for
indicators of impairment at the end of each six month period.

• evaluated the group’s estimate of head office costs
directly attributable to development activities;
• tested, on a sample basis, capital costs incurred;
• assessed the judgements made in relation to the
timing of recognition of property acquisitions and the
measurement of incomplete property at balance date;
• considered the attribution of costs from work in
progress to completed village units, care facilities
and other assets; and
• evaluated the group’s review of work in progress
at balance date for impairment.

Deferred Management Fee Revenue Recognition
WHY SIGNIFICANT?

HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER

Deferred management fee revenue is 33% of Summerset’s total
revenue. Summerset recognises deferred management fee
revenue from residents over the longer of the expected period
of tenure or the contractual right to revenue in accordance
with the terms of the resident’s occupational right agreement.

Our work focused on understanding the overall
calculation methodology and testing the integrity of
inputs and key assumptions to revenue recognition
throughout the period. In doing so, we:

The amount of revenue recognised in each year is subject to
the group’s judgement of each residents’ expected tenure in
the village, the terms of the occupational right agreement
and the type of unit occupied.
Deferred management fee revenue and the associated
deferred management fee receivable and revenue in advance
balances are discussed in Note 3 Revenue to the consolidated
financial statements.

• assessed the accuracy of the inputs to, and calculation
of, deferred management fee revenue recognised
during 2016;
• agreed the contractual terms of a sample of residents
used in the revenue recognition calculation to the
occupational right agreement;
• compared the movements year on year in revenue
recognised by village and unit type based on an
expectation derived from the nature of the population
of occupational right agreements; and
• considered the group’s assessment of assumed
tenure against actual observed tenure.

SUMMERSET ANNUAL REPORT 2016

GOVERNANCE

Summerset is committed to following best-practice governance structures and principles and to having good governance
overseeing the way in which the Company operates. It also takes account of the Company’s listings on both NZX and ASX.
Summerset has adopted the principles below as an appropriate way to demonstrate Summerset’s compliance with these
fundamental principles and to illustrate the transparency of Summerset’s approach to corporate governance for the benefit
of its Shareholders and other stakeholders.
Summerset’s Board and Committee Charters, and policies and guidelines referred to in this section, are available to view
at www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/corporate-governance/charters-policies.

1 ENSURING SOLID FOUNDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT
Role of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is elected by Shareholders, and has responsibility for taking appropriate steps to protect and enhance
the value of the assets of the Company in the best interests of its Shareholders. The Board has adopted a formal Board Charter
detailing its authority, responsibilities, membership and operation.
The key responsibilities of the Board include setting the overall direction and strategy of the Company, establishing appropriate
policies and monitoring performance of management. The Board appoints the Chief Executive Officer and delegates the day-today operating of the business to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer implements policies and strategies set
by the Board and is accountable to it. The Board also has responsibility for ensuring the Company’s financial position is sound,
financial statements comply with generally accepted accounting practice, and for ensuring that the Company adheres to high
standards of ethical and corporate behaviour.
The Board currently carries out its responsibilities according to the following mandate:
• At least two, or, if there are eight or more Directors, three or one-third of the total number of Directors should be Independent
as defined in the NZX Listing Rules;
• The Chair of the Board should be a non-executive Director;
• Directors should possess a broad range of skills, qualifications and experience, and remain current on how to best perform
their duties as Directors;
• Information of sufficient content, quality and timeliness as the Board considers necessary shall be provided by management
to allow the Board to effectively discharge its duties;
• The effectiveness and performance of the Board and its individual members should be re-evaluated on an annual basis.
All Directors have been issued letters setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment. The Chief Executive Officer and
members of the executive management team have employment agreements setting out their roles and conditions of employment.
Delegation of authority
The Board delegates to the Chief Executive Officer responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy and for managing the
Company’s operations. The Chief Executive Officer has Board-approved levels of authority and, in turn, sub-delegates authority
in some cases to direct reports, and has established a formal process for direct reports to sub-delegate certain authorities as
appropriate. This is documented in the Delegation and Powers Reserved to the Board Policy.
Senior executive performance
The Board evaluates annually the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer reviews the
performance of direct reports and reports to the Board on those reviews. The evaluation is based on criteria that include
the performance of the business and the accomplishment of longer-term strategic objectives. It may include quantitative
and qualitative measures. During the most recent financial year, performance evaluations were conducted in accordance
with this process.

2 STRUCTURING THE BOARD TO ADD VALUE
Board composition
The Company’s constitution prescribes that the Board shall be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, with at least two
Directors ordinarily resident in New Zealand. The Board currently comprises five non-executive Independent Directors. In
determining whether a Director is Independent the Board has regard to the NZX Listing Rules.
As at 31 December 2016, the non-executive Independent Directors were Rob Campbell (Chair), James Ogden, Dr Marie Bismark,
Anne Urlwin and Gráinne Troute. Dr Andrew Wong will be appointed as a non-executive Independent Director on 1 March 2017.
More information on the Directors, including their interests, qualifications and shareholdings, is provided in the Directors’
Profiles and Statutory Information sections of this report.
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings. The Directors generally receive material for Board meetings five working days in
advance, except in the case of special meetings for which the time period may be shorter owing to the urgency of the matter to
be considered.
All Directors have access to executive management to discuss issues or obtain information on specific areas in relation to items
to be considered at Board meetings or other areas as considered appropriate. Key executives and managers are invited to
attend and participate in appropriate sessions at Board meetings. Directors have unrestricted access to Company records and
information.
Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice relating to the affairs of the Company or other responsibilities.
Prior approval of the Chair is required before seeking such advice and Directors are expected to ensure that the cost of such
advice is reasonable.
Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s constitution and the Rules, one third of the Directors are required to retire by rotation and
may offer themselves for re-election by Shareholders each year. Procedures for the appointment and removal of Directors are
also governed by the constitution. The Nominations and Remuneration Committee identifies and nominates candidates to fill
Director vacancies for the approval of the Board.
Board committees
The Board has three standing committees, being the Audit Committee, the Nominations and Remuneration Committee and the
Clinical Governance Committee. Each committee operates under charters approved by the Board, and any recommendations
they make are recommendations to the Board. The terms of reference for each committee are reviewed annually. All Directors
are entitled to attend committee meetings.
Audit Committee
Details for this Committee can be found in section 4 of this Statement of Corporate Governance.
Nominations and Remuneration Committee
The role of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee is to assist the Board in establishing and reviewing remuneration
policies and practices for the Company and in reviewing Board composition. Specific objectives include:
• Assist the Board in planning the Board’s composition;
• Evaluate the competencies required of prospective Directors (both non-executive and executive);
• Identify those prospective Directors and establish their degree of independence;
• Develop the succession plans for the Board, and make recommendations to the Board accordingly;
• Oversee the process of the Board’s annual performance self-assessment and the performance of the Directors; and
• Establish remuneration policies and practices and set and review the remuneration of the company’s Chief Executive
Officer, executive management team and Directors.

GOVERNANCE
(continued)

The Nominations and Remuneration Committee must be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, the majority of whom must
be Independent. The Committee currently comprises of Anne Urlwin (Chair), Dr Marie Bismark, James Ogden and Gráinne Troute.
The Board’s policy is that the Board needs to have an appropriate mix of skills, experience and diversity to ensure that it is well
equipped. The Board reviews and evaluates on a regular basis the skill mix required and identifies where gaps exists.

Board performance
The Board undertakes an annual self-assessment of its performance, as does each Committee. The Chair also undertakes an
annual review of individual Board member performance.

Clinical Governance Committee

3 PROMOTING ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE DECISION MAKING

The role of the Clinical Governance Committee is to assist the Board in ensuring a systematic approach to maintaining and
improving the quality of care provided by the Company. Specific objectives include:

Ethical standards

The Board maintains high standards of ethical conduct and expects the Company’s employees to act legally and with integrity
in a manner consistent with the policies, guiding principles and values that are in place. These include the following:
• Code of Ethics – This guide sets out the basic principles of legal and ethical conduct expected of all employees and Directors.
The Company encourages open and honest communication by staff about any current or potential problem, complaint,
suggestion, concern, or question.
• Conflicts of interest – To maintain integrity in decision making each Director must advise the Board of any potential conflict
of interest if such arises. If a significant conflict of interest exists, the Director concerned will have no involvement in the
decision-making process relating to the matter.
• Securities trading – Directors and employees of the Company are subject to limitations on their ability to buy or sell Company
shares in accordance with the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, the Rules, and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.
• Gifts, entertainment and inducements – The Company has a gifts, entertainment and inducements policy governing the
acceptance and reporting of benefits given to staff by third parties.
• Interest register – In accordance with the Companies Act 1993 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, the Company

4 SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING
Audit Committee
While the ultimate responsibility to ensure the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting rests with the Board,
the Company has in place processes to ensure the accurate presentation of its financial position. These include:
• An appropriately resourced Audit Committee operating under a written charter with specific responsibilities for financial
reporting and risk management;
• Review and consideration by the Audit Committee of the financial information and preliminary releases of results to the
market, which then make recommendations to the Board;
• A process to ensure the independence and competence of the Company’s external auditors and a process to ensure their
compliance with the Company’s Audit Independence Policy;
• Responsibility for appointment of the external auditors residing with the Audit Committee;
One of the main purposes of the Audit Committee is to ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.
The Audit Committee make enquiries of management and the external auditors so that they are satisfied as to the validity
and accuracy of all aspects of the Company’s financial reporting. All aspects of the external audit are reported back to the
Audit Committee and the external auditors are given the opportunity at Audit Committee meetings to meet with Directors.

The Audit Committee also considers the adequacy of Summerset’s internal controls and oversees internal audit processes.
The Audit Committee must be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, the majority of whom must be Independent. The
committee is chaired by an Independent chair who is not the chair of the Board. The Committee currently comprises of James
Ogden (Chair), Anne Urlwin, Rob Campbell and Gráinne Troute.
The Committee generally invites the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer and external
auditors to attend meetings. The Committee also meets and receives regular reports from the external auditors without
management present, concerning any matters that arise in connection with the performance of their role.

5 MAKING TIMELY AND BALANCED DISCLOSURE
The Company is committed to promoting shareholder confidence through open, timely and accurate market communication.
The Company has in place procedures designed to ensure compliance with its disclosure obligations under the NZX and ASX
Listing Rules. The Company’s Market Disclosure and Communication policy sets out the responsibilities of the Board and
management in disclosure and communication and procedures for managing this obligation.

6 RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS
The Company seeks to ensure that its shareholders understand its activities by communicating effectively with them and giving
them ready access to clear and balanced information about the company.
To assist with this, the Company’s website is maintained with relevant information, including copies of presentations, reports
and market releases. The Company’s key corporate governance policies are also included on the website.
The Company’s major communications with shareholders during the financial year include its annual and half-year reports
and the annual meeting of shareholders. The annual and half-year reports are available in electronic and hard copy format.

7

RECOGNISING AND MANAGING RISK

The Company has a risk management framework for identifying, overseeing, managing and controlling risk. The processes
involved require the maintenance of a risk register that identifies key business risks and initiatives deployed to manage and
mitigate those risks.
The Board has responsibility for the oversight of Summerset’s risk management programme. Their responsibilities in this
regard are set out in the Board Charter.
The Company’s senior management maintain a risk register and this is updated regularly.

8 REMUNERATING FAIRLY AND RESPONSIBLY
The Board’s Nominations and Remuneration Committee has a formal charter. Its membership and role are set out under
section 2 above.
Further details on remuneration are provided in the Remuneration section of this Report.

Gráinne Troute was appointed as a Director on 1 September 2016.

Summerset’s remuneration policy for members of the executive team provides the opportunity for them to receive, where
performance merits, a total remuneration package in the upper quartile for equivalent market-matched roles. The Nomination
and Remuneration Committee reviews the annual performance appraisal outcomes for all executive members, including the
Chief Executive Officer. The review takes into account external benchmarking to ensure competitiveness with comparable market
peers, along with consideration of an individual’s performance, skills, expertise and experience.
Total remuneration is made up of three components: fixed remuneration, short-term performance-based cash remuneration and
long-term performance-based equity remuneration.
Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of base salary and benefits. Summerset’s policy is to pay fixed remuneration with reference to the
fixed pay market median.
Short-term incentives
Short-term incentives (STI) are at-risk payments designed to motivate and reward for performance, typically in that financial
year. The target value of an STI payment is set annually, usually as a percentage of the executive’s base salary. For 2016, the
relevant percentages were 25% to 50%.
A proportion (80% for the Chief Executive Officer, 70% for other executive team members) of the STI is related to achievement
of annual performance metrics which aim to align executives to a shared set of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on
business priorities for the next 12 months. Target areas for the shared KPIs for 2016 are outlined below:

WEIGHTING

Directors’ fees above include standard remuneration for holding Committee Chair roles.

Financial: Underlying EBITDA performance against budget

40%

As at 31 December 2016, the standard annual Director fees per annum were $165,000 for the Chairman, and $80,000 for
non-executive Directors. The additional fee for the Chairman of the Audit Committee was $15,000 and additional fees for the
Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Chairman of the Clinical Governance Committee were
$7,500 each.

Occupation right agreement sales results against budget

20%

Retirement unit delivery against budget

20%

Clinical and customer satisfaction

10%

Directors’ fees are reviewed from time to time. The maximum aggregate amount of remuneration payable by Summerset to
Directors (in their capacity as Directors) was set at $600,000 per annum in April 2014 for the non-executive Directors. Current
annualised Directors’ fees are $515,000, inclusive of additional remuneration for Committee Chairs. An additional Director will
be appointed as a non-executive Independent Director on 1 March 2017, which will increase annualised Directors’ fees to $595,000.
The Board intends to propose to shareholders that the maximum aggregate amount of remuneration payable by Summerset to
Directors (in their capacity as Directors) is increased at the Annual Meeting in April 2017.

Employee and health and safety initiatives

10%

Directors’ fees exclude GST, where appropriate. Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for costs directly associated with carrying
out their duties, including travel costs.
Directors and Officers also have the benefit of Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. Cover is for damages, judgements, fines,
penalties, legal costs awarded and defence costs arising from wrongful acts committed whilst acting for Summerset. There are
some exclusions within the policy. The insurance cover is supplemented by the provision of Director and Officer indemnities from
the Company but this does not extend to criminal acts.

EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
The remuneration of members of the executive team (CEO and direct reports) is designed to promote a high-performance culture
and to align executive reward to the development and achievement of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable
value for shareholders.
The Board is assisted in delivering its responsibilities and objectives for executive remuneration by the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee. The role and membership of this Committee is set out in section 2 of the Statement of Corporate
Governance.

There are three performance levels within each target area: ‘gate-opener’, ‘on-target’ and ‘maximum performance’, with 100% of
the amount allocated to that target area being payable when the on-target level is achieved. The maximum performance levels
allow employees to be rewarded for performance above target levels. The maximum amount of an STI payment for an executive
team member is 112% of the STI on-target amount for that executive team member.
The balance of the STI is related to individual performance measures.
In the event that gate-opener underlying EBITDA performance against budget is not achieved, no STI payment will be made.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives (LTI) are at-risk payments designed to align the reward of executive team members with the enhancement
of shareholder value over a multi-year period.
Under the LTI, executive team members are able to purchase shares in Summerset Group Holdings Limited. The shares for the
plans are held by a nominee on behalf of the executive team members until such time after the vesting of shares that the nominee
is directed by the executive team member to transfer or sell the shares, or the shares are sold by the nominee if vesting criteria
are not met. The shares carry the same rights as all other ordinary shares.
The Group has provided executive team members participating in the LTI with interest-free limited recourse loans to fund
the acquisition of the shares for these plans. These loans must be repaid in full before shares are transferred to executives
from the nominee.

SUMMERSET ANNUAL REPORT 2016

REMUNERATION
(continued)

An LTI plan commenced on 1 November 2011, upon the Company listing on the NZX Main Board, under which grants were made
to executive team members. Vesting of shares was contingent on achievement of certain profitability levels in the business. The
vesting criteria were achieved and all shares vested. This plan has now closed with final vesting occurring in December 2013.
Loans remain outstanding for vested shares under this plan, with payment due by 31 October 2017.
An updated plan commenced on 16 December 2013. Under this plan, grants are made annually, with performance measured
over two-and-three-year periods. The value of each grant is set at the date of the grant and currently represents 15% to 40%
of an executive team member’s fixed remuneration. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee takes independent advice
in determining the number of shares to issue for each grant. Vesting of shares is subject to achievement of performance hurdles
which are assessed over two-and-three-year periods.
The performance hurdles for each grant under the LTI plan made between 2013 and 2015 are based on Summerset’s total
shareholder return (TSR) relative to the performance of relevant peers and the NZX 50.

The STI in the table on the previous page is based on amounts paid in the financial period. The LTI awarded refers to shares
eligible for vesting during the financial period.

DESCRIPTION

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

STI

Set at 50% of fixed remuneration for FY2016 on-plan
performance, up to a maximum of 1.12 times (equal
to 56% of fixed remuneration), where the highest
levels of both company and individual performance
measures are achieved.

80% based on the company target
areas (see table earlier for weightings)

103.8%

20% based on individual measures

100%

In February 2016, vesting for 193,181 shares issued
under the LTI Scheme at $3.20 on 16 December 2013
was assessed per the Plan Rules. The assessment
period was 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015. The
vesting criteria were not met and no shares vested.

50% measured against comparable

LTI

The performance hurdles for the grants made in 2016 are based on:
• 50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget)
• 25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group)
• 10% employee initiatives
• 10% customer initiatives
• 5% clinical strategy initiatives

The above STI payment will be paid in FY2017.

Performance hurdles are set by the Board with the objective of aligning executive reward to the development and achievement
of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for shareholders. The Board considers that the performance
hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for shareholders.

PAY GAP
The pay gap represents the number of times greater the Chief Executive Officer remuneration is to an employee paid at the
median of all Summerset employees. For the purposes of determining the median paid to all Summerset employees, all permanent
full-time, permanent part-time and fixed-term employees are included, with part-time employee remuneration adjusted to a full
time equivalent amount.
At 31 December 2016, the Chief Executive Officer’s base salary of $445,485 was 11.6 times that of the median employee at
$38,480 per annum. The Chief Executive Officer’s total remuneration, including STI and LTI was $865,620, 21.7 times the total
remuneration of the median employee at $39,838.
