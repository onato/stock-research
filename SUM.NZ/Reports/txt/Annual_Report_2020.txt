Julian Cook
Chief Executive Officer

Welcome to Summerset’s annual
report for the 12 months ended
31 December 2020. This report
covers an unprecedented year in
which the COVID-19 pandemic had
a major impact on our business,
as it did throughout the world.
Our priority has been keeping our
residents and staff safe, and we
currently maintain our record of no
COVID-19 cases at Summerset.
This year we take our first
step toward integrated reporting.
This provides a fuller picture of
Summerset’s entire business, with
financial and sustainability elements
in one report.
Business performance
Reported underlying profit for the
full year is $98.3 million, a decrease
of 7% on 2019. Our IFRS net profit
after tax is $230.8 million, up 32%
on 2019. Overall, the value of
investment property is $3.6 billion,
up 17% on 2019.
The financial performance of the
business for 2020 has been pleasing.
This is despite the impact of the
COVID-19 lockdown. During this
period prospects were unable to visit
our villages or sell their properties
and we have spent an additional
$9.2 million to date on COVID-19
related costs including preventative
measures to keep residents and
staff safe.

Our COVID-19 response
2020 was dominated by COVID-19
but we are pleased and grateful not
to have had any cases among staff
or residents to date. We activated
our pandemic plan in early March,
and moved quickly to protect our
residents and support them through
the subsequent lockdowns.
A range of protections were put in
place to keep our residents and staff
safe. The measures we took included
mandatory temperature checks and
face masks for staff, security on
village gates to screen visitors, a
negative COVID-19 test prior to
admission for new care residents,
and additional cleaning protocols. At
the outset of the crisis we also took
on extra staff in our care centres and
villages to provide additional care
for residents.
We stepped up physically distanced
activities in the villages to
provide connection and comfort
for residents, operated a grocery
delivery service for residents, and
set up an online wellness centre
to keep residents entertained. We
also provided iPads so residents
could video-call families and
friends during the higher alert
levels. The response from both
residents and their families on our
handling of the pandemic has been
overwhelmingly positive. We would
like to thank our dedicated staff
for their professionalism, resilience
and hard work throughout the
lockdown periods.

CHAIR AND CEO'S REPORT

2020 in review

$98.3m

Underlying profit

In April 2020, we received
$8.6 million from the Government’s
initial wage subsidy scheme. This
was a period of great uncertainty for
the business.
At that time, sales of occupation
rights — a major source of
revenue — had ceased. We also
introduced several cost-saving
measures, including moving more
than 230 corporate staff to a fourday week. The Executive Team and
Board of Directors also took a 20%
pay cut for the same 10-week period.
We repaid the wage subsidy in full
in December 2020 as trading for the
business has been strong over the
second half of 2020.
August’s lockdown in Auckland
was a reminder that COVID-19 will
continue to impact our residents and
staff for the foreseeable future.
Villages and care
Village life has been affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic and
we look forward to the rollout
of the COVID-19 immunisation
programme, due this year.
We have been pleased to see
heightened enquiries and sales
from the third quarter of 2020
onwards. Performance in our care
business continued to track well,
with occupancy for the year at 96%
in our developed villages, versus
90% for the aged care sector overall.

Protections were put
in place to keep our
residents and staff safe
during lockdowns

Adapting to COVID-19
Summerset worked hard to ensure that
its residents and staff were kept safe
throughout 2020. We are pleased that
we have had no cases of COVID-19 in
our villages to date.

Expanding into Australia
Our first village in the Melbourne suburb
of Cranbourne North is expected to
receive development approval shortly.
Summerset also holds eight hectares
in Torquay on the Bellarine Peninsula
in Victoria.

Chair Rob Campbell retires
Rob Campbell announced his
retirement from the Board in December
2020, ending a decade as Chair.
Mr Campbell oversaw Summerset’s
listing on the NZX in 2011, and under
his leadership Summerset has grown
to become one of the NZX’s top
20 companies.
The Board thanks Mr Campbell for
his outstanding leadership which
covered a wide range of initiatives
and achievements, including the
introduction of memory care centres
for people living with dementia, an
improved staff offering, becoming
New Zealand’s first carbonzeroTM
retirement operator, and more
recently, Summerset’s expansion
across the Tasman.
His depth of experience and genuine
passion for the people at Summerset
will be missed.
The Board commenced the search for a
new Board member in December 2020
and once this search is complete, will
appoint a director as the new Chair.

Annual Report 2020

Growth and development
Despite the closure of our
construction sites during the first
COVID-19 lockdown, we completed
next-generation main buildings at
our Casebrook and Rototuna villages
in 2020.

We started 2020 with a plan to
prioritise pay and training for our
teams. In January we increased the
pay for care staff to equal the top
pay rates in the sector and increased
weekend allowances for care staff
in April.

These new buildings reflect the
evolution of our village centre
designs. They include our new stateof-the-art memory care centre for
people living with dementia, as
well as serviced apartments and a
care centre.

We introduced an online
learning system and new training
programmes in 2020, enhancing
our onboarding and professional
development programmes.

Earthworks have progressed well
at our St Johns site in Auckland
and construction work will start
there in 2021. Building also starts in
2021 at our Lower Hutt site, where
final resource consent was granted
in November. We also lodged
resource consent for our villages in
Prebbleton and Rangiora. Our land
bank continues to expand, with the
acquisition of our ninth property in
Auckland in October 2020.
Our latest land acquisition in
Auckland is in Half Moon Bay. It
will be our first retirement village in
East Auckland.

We also invested in our
clinical leaders through the
implementation of a leadership
development programme.
Summerset was accredited with
tertiary status in the Accident
Compensation Corporation (ACC)’s
Accredited Employers Programme
for the third year running. During
2020, we launched three-year
strategies for health and safety,
learning and development, and
diversity and inclusion. These
strategies cover all parts of the
business, with tailored plans created
to meet the varying requirements of
individual business groups.

We completed
next-generation
main buildings at
our Casebrook and
Rototuna villages

Sustainability
We have continued to make positive
progress on our carbon reduction
targets this year. Notably, we have
set a new science-aligned carbon
reduction target that commits us to
a 62% reduction in carbon emissions
per square metre of building area by
2032 (from 2017 levels).

Our people
We were pleased to see our staff
engagement results increase in
2020, which at the time of survey
completion were at or above the
Australia/New Zealand and global
benchmarks of companies using the
same engagement tool.

The Board has oversight of climaterelated risks and opportunities
through our current reporting
framework. The forthcoming Task
Force for Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) requirements will
add further disclosure in this area
and Summerset is well placed to
meet these.

Looking ahead
Despite COVID-19, we have gained
good ground since the end of New
Zealand’s nationwide lockdown in
May 2020. Our third and fourth
quarter sales were at record highs
and our business continues to
perform well.
We are optimistic about growth in
2021 and beyond. Our expansion
into Australia will take a major
step forward with the launch
of our first retirement village in
Victoria in late 2021/early 2022,
and we anticipate an increased
build rate across our New Zealand
sites. We will make further
progress toward sustainability
across Summerset, particularly in
design and construction.
We hold the largest land bank of
units in New Zealand’s retirement
village sector, providing a strong
outlook for our construction and
sales teams. This provides us
with a good spread of sites
across the country, allowing us
to change tempo depending on
market conditions.
Thank you to everyone who has
worked so hard throughout 2020. A
special thank you to our Summerset
staff, as well as their families and
support networks, for helping to
keep all our residents safe this year.

A decade
at the top
Farewell from Julian Cook
It has been a privilege for me to lead
this company and to be part of an
organisation and industry that has
changed so many people’s lives for
the better.

10

I am retiring as Chief Executive
on 29 March after 10 years at
Summerset, seven of them as Chief
Executive. Summerset has grown
both in terms of size and maturity
over the last decade, and now is the
right time to hand it over for the next
phase of growth in New Zealand
and Australia.

I am enormously proud of what we
deliver to residents, staff and our
communities. Summerset started
out over 23 years ago as a small
family business founded by John
and Rose O’Sullivan. Their goal was
to create a retirement village that
was good enough for their nana.
This philosophy guides us still and
we always ask ourselves, 'Is it good
enough for Mum?'
In 2014, my first year as Chief
Executive, we had 20 villages, 3,000
residents and 700 staff.

We now have 32 retirement villages
and another 10 in the pipeline. We
will open our first retirement village
in Australia in late 2021/early 2022,
and have another piece of land in
Victoria for a second village. We are
now the second largest retirement
village operator in New Zealand, with
over 6,200 residents and more than
1,800 staff.
We have grown sustainably over the
years, and despite 2020’s COVID-19
pandemic and lockdown, we are in
a strong position to continue into
the future.

CHAIR AND CEO'S REPORT

I am enormously proud
of what we deliver to
residents, staff and
our communities
Looking back, there are many
highlights, three in particular will stay
with me. The first of these is the 2011
stock exchange listing. This gave us
the capital to accelerate our growth.
The introduction of comprehensive
staff benefits, including health
insurance and the all staff share
scheme, was another step toward
rewarding our staff for their hard
work and loyalty. More recently,
starting up Summerset’s Australian
arm has given us the chance to use
all we have learnt in New Zealand to
build a brand-new offering for
Australian retirees.
In 2011, I knew Summerset had great
potential for growth, but most
importantly, I saw that there was
scope to improve our offering to
residents and staff.
My regular visits to our villages
assure me we are bringing the best
of life to our residents. I see a lot of
joy and companionship in our
villages, with people taking up new
hobbies, sharing old ones with new
friends, and creating a unique and
vibrant community.
Over time, we have gradually refined
and enhanced the homes, facilities
and activities we offer our residents.
New Zealand has a growing
population of older people, and it
makes me proud to see the lifestyle
and comfort we provide those who
choose to live in our villages.
I leave the company knowing we
have fulfilled the potential I saw 10
years ago. I have loved my time at
Summerset, and I will greatly miss all
its people.
Julian

Introducing
Scott Scoullar

At Summerset we are fortunate
to play such an important part in
people’s lives.

I have had the pleasure
of being Summerset’s Chief
Financial Officer for almost seven
years now and the Deputy
Chief Executive for three years.
During this time, I have worked
alongside Julian and our Board
developing and implementing
Summerset’s strategy.

Our residents look to us to provide
a home and living environment
that is fulfilling, and they trust us
every day to look after them. The
way I think about it, every resident
living in our villages could be our
mum, dad, nana or poppa – and
therefore we will continue to make
their lives as special as we can.

It’s a great honour as well as
a great opportunity to lead
one of New Zealand’s largest
retirement providers into its
next phase of development.

I’m looking forward to starting
as Chief Executive and meeting
as many residents and staff as
possible. I’d like to thank Julian for
everything he has achieved over
the last 10 years.

The possibilities as we embark on
our growth strategy into Australia
are exciting, and many of our
new sites in New Zealand are
truly ground-breaking.

Thank you to all our residents who
have chosen to live with us, to
our staff and to our shareholders.
I look forward to working with you
all over the coming years.
Scott

OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

Our Summerset community is made
up of more than 6,200 residents in
over 4,400 units and over 900 care
beds. We employ over 1,800 staff
across 32 retirement villages.
COVID-19
Due to the global pandemic,
2020 was difficult and challenging.
However, New Zealand's effective
public health response, and the
plans and procedures we put in
place, resulted in zero COVID-19
cases among our residents and staff
to date.
We engaged our pandemic plan
as soon as news of the virus
emerged and pulled together our
Crisis Response Team.

Resident wellbeing
During 2020 we continued the
rollout of our signature fitness
programme for residents. Designed
specifically for over-70s by an
experienced personal training
company, the programme has been
accredited as a falls-prevention class
by the Ministry of Health and ACC.
The new programme includes
mental and physical exercises to
improve and maintain coordination,
balance and cognitive health. To
ensure the effective delivery of the
programme, each class is run by a
fitness instructor. The programme is
now available in seven villages and
we will roll it out to a similar number
in 2021.
Although we had to postpone our
popular Connect speaker series
during the COVID-19 lockdowns,
we organised virtual events for our
residents. These included a winetasting experience with Villa Maria
and a food-focused talk by chef and
author Peta Mathias.
We reintroduced face-to-face
events in July 2020, with Connect
talks from Olympic boardsailor
Barbara Kendall and comedians
Ginette McDonald and Pinky Agnew.

We also held a second series of
‘Understanding dementia’ talks in
conjunction with Dementia New
Zealand from September 2020. We
plan to continue hosting virtual
events alongside our village-based
events into the future.

Resident wellbeing is
at the centre of what
we do and Summerset
continues to plan for
a variety of virtual and
village based events
Dementia-friendly accreditation
In April 2020 we achieved
dementia-friendly accreditation
from Alzheimers New Zealand. This
means we are nationally recognised
as a safe, accepting and supportive
place for people with dementia.
Alzheimers New Zealand’s Chief
Executive, Catherine Hall, said, “the
Committee was impressed with the
work Summerset has initiated to
challenge stigma and create kinder,
more accepting communities for
people living with dementia,

and the wide range of
creative dementia friendly initiatives
observed during the audit.”
To achieve this, we carried
out intensive work across our
villages, from training each staff
member, to creatively meeting the
individual needs of residents living
with dementia.
More than 195 corporate staff
have also completed an online
training module to increase their
understanding of dementia.
Summerset has a three-year
partnership with Dementia New
Zealand and has been working
alongside the organisation to
provide public talks at our villages to
reduce stigma around the disease.

Summerset has been
recognised as a safe
and accepting place
for people living
with dementia

Online training enables a consistent
learning experience for all our staff,
wherever they work. Our first online
training programme was a sixmodule self-paced learning
programme for our sales team.

Online learning was invaluable
during the nationwide lockdown,
when we recruited more than 120
nurses and caregivers during the
first six weeks. It allowed us to induct
new staff into our processes,
procedures, and health and safety
protocols before they had even set
foot on Summerset premises.
Our recruitment campaign for extra
staff included contacting over 80
companies that were making
redundancies due to COVID-19.

Attracting and retaining staff
Staff retention and turnover
improved significantly over 2020,
with turnover now below the
industry average. This was partly due
to the border closures and greater
economic uncertainty brought
about by COVID-19. However, it
was also the result of ongoing
improvements in our employee
offering and culture.
During the year we changed our
survey provider for measuring
staff engagement. We now use
the Peakon survey, whose muchimproved technology assisted us in
achieving 86% staff participation.
Our overall staff engagement score
increased from 7.7 to 7.8 out of
10 in 2020, putting us at or above
the top quartile of companies using
Peakon globally.

Diversity and inclusion
During 2020 we also progressed our
diversity and inclusion strategy. The
specialist consultancy, Diversitas,
thoroughly examined our policies
and processes through a diversity
and inclusion lens, and interviewed
staff across the organisation. As
a result of the review, we have
now identified opportunities for
continued improvement and a
three-year plan has been developed
with work starting in early 2021.
Continuing improvement in health
and safety
We were pleased to be reaccredited
with tertiary status in ACC’s
Accredited Employers Programme
in 2020, which we have held since
June 2017. The annual renewal audit
provides an important snapshot of
safety and injury management in
our workplace. We are committed to
the core values of this programme,
creating safe work environments for
our people and ensuring that we
continue to be leaders in health
and safety.

Our
villages
Summerset continues to grow its portfolio of
high-quality retirement villages with amenities
and facilities designed for Kiwi and Australian retirees.

Summerset at Monterey Park, Hobsonville

OUR VILLAGES

Summerset has 32 villages in
operation or in development across
New Zealand, and a further eight
sites in New Zealand held for future
development. In 2020 we purchased
2.8 hectares of land in Auckland in
Half Moon Bay.
Our land bank for future
development is the largest in the
New Zealand retirement sector,
allowing us to double our current
resident population. We have
retirement villages in the main
urban centres, including Auckland,
New Zealand’s most populous
city, with five villages and four
more in the pipeline. We also
have villages in major provincial
cities, including Nelson and New
Plymouth, and popular retirement
destinations such as Tauranga and
the Kapiti Coast.
2020 successes
In 2020 we started earthworks at two
sites and our first residents moved
into three newly opened villages.

Village highlights
New residents
We were pleased to welcome our
first residents to our new villages at
Papamoa Beach (Tauranga),
Te Awa (Napier) and Bell Block
(New Plymouth). We now have two
villages in the Bay of Plenty, four in the
Hawke's Bay and two in Taranaki.

New earthworks
We started earthworks on two sites
in 2020, at St Johns and Whangarei.
Members of Ngāti Hau, a hapū
of Ngāpuhi in the area of the
new Whangarei village site, gathered
for a morning blessing, alongside
contractors, local kaumātua Mike
Kake and Dave Coyne, and Group
Construction Manager Jason Rahui.

We also completed construction on
two next-generation main buildings,
at Casebrook in March and Rototuna
in November.
Our main buildings form the heart
of our villages, providing a vibrant
community hub for residents, staff,
families and friends.
At 9,000m2, our new main buildings
are almost double the size of those in
our earlier villages.

New technology
We imported New Zealand’s first
Tovertafel — an interactive lightshow
providing stimulation for people
with cognitive impairments. The new
technology is from the Netherlands for
use in our newer memory care centres.

Memory care centres
Summerset is a New Zealand leader
in next-generation memory care.
Since the 2017 opening of our awardwinning memory care centre in
Levin, we have refined the design
and features for our newest centres
in Casebrook and Rototuna.
Our in-house design and operations
teams have used research from
international dementia design
specialists to create apartmentstyle living for residents with
dementia. The modern design
offers clear wayfinding, dementiafriendly signage, large communal
areas and a secure outdoor
courtyard for freedom of movement
and independence.

Priorities for 2021
In 2021 we will complete our
Ellerslie village by finishing the last
independent apartment building. In
addition, we will deliver our first
units as part of the Hobsonville
village extension.

Regional main buildings will be
delivered in both our Richmond and
Avonhead villages in 2021. These
will provide further well-appointed
amenities for our residents.

We expect to see good progress
in 2021 at our St Johns site. Bulk
earthworks will finish in March
2021, and construction will start on
the 8,500m2 basement which will
contain carparking for residents.

We also received final resource
consent from the Environment
Court for our Boulcott site in
Lower Hutt in November 2020.
Construction has started on the
village, which will ultimately be home
to more than 300 residents.

OUR VILLAGES

Expanding the model
into Australia
It is important that we have a strong
local base as we expand into
Australia. We are gradually
developing our Australian team and
appointed the heads of the design,
sales and operations teams for
Victoria in 2020.
Two of these roles were filled by
existing Summerset staff, who will
move to Melbourne early in 2021. We
are looking forward to providing the
Australian market with our
continuum of care offering and
the backing of a trusted brand
with 23 years’ experience in
retirement living.
Providing a home for life
in Australia
Summerset will offer a full
continuum of care in Australia.
This sets us apart from many
competitors in Australia, where it is
common for independent living and
care to operate separately and
across different locations.
We will be building Cranbourne
North in carefully planned stages.
We expect to deliver approximately
40 villas in the first stage of the
development, from late 2021/
early 2022.
Planning for our specialist care
centre and care services at
Cranbourne North is already well
under way. The care centre will
offer a unique household model,
with no more than 18 residents
in a household.
Each resident will have a private
room and access to shared lounge
and dining areas. This will provide
them with the comfort, intimacy and
closeness of a family unit, and will
allow our care staff to focus on each
individual resident.

Half Moon Bay
In October 2020 we announced the purchase of a 2.8-hectare site in
Half Moon Bay.
Once consented, it will be our ninth village in Auckland and our very
first in East Auckland.
It will include independent living and serviced apartments, care suites
and a memory care centre. It is near the Half Moon Bay Marina with ferry
services to the CBD and Waiheke Island.
Upper floors will have west-facing views across Half Moon Bay, towards
the city and out to the Waitakeres.
The number of people in the 75+ age group in East Auckland is forecast
to increase by over 50% in the next eight years.

Our commitment
to sustainability
Summerset was certified as New Zealand’s
first carbonzeroTM retirement village operator in 2018,
and we have continued to build on our commitment
to sustainability each year.

OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY

Summerset has a large construction
business, giving us scope to reduce
our carbon emissions and futureproof our villages against climaterelated risks. We can reduce
emissions by adopting new
technologies in our building designs,
using greener building materials and
creating landscapes that are more
water efficient.
As part of its goal of reaching net
zero carbon emissions by 2050, the
Government is expected to
introduce regulation on the Building
for Climate Change Programme in
2021. Summerset has made a
submission on this as part of the
consultation process.

In 2020, Summerset committed to
a science-aligned carbon reduction
target, that commits us to a 62%
reduction per square metre of
building area by 2032 (from 2017
levels). We are the only New Zealand
retirement village operator to have
done this. Summerset is also working
closely with its supply chains to
reduce carbon emissions. We have
also expanded our emissions
reduction programme into our
villages and started preparing for
innovation in future village builds.

Emissions reduction programme
Summerset is Toitū carbonzeroTM
certified. We have been measuring,
managing and reporting on our
carbon footprint since 2017. From
2018, our carbon emissions have
been independently audited by
Toitū Envirocare to the ISO14064-1
standard. We are on track to meet
our target of a 5% reduction in all
operational emissions intensity by
the end of 2022.
Our internal tracking shows we
have reduced our carbon emissions
intensity by 31% since 2017.

Given our significant property
development activities, we calculate
our total gross carbon emissions
per square metre of build. This has
decreased by 22% since 2017.
Decrease in absolute
carbon emissions
Summerset’s total emissions in 2020
were 6,414 tCO2e, which is 1% lower
than the previous year’s total of
6,466 tCO2e and 8% higher than
the base year total of 5,939 tCO2e.
Energy use accounts for 80% of our
carbon emissions.

Reducing electricity and
gas usage
We fine-tuned, maintained and
upgraded equipment throughout
2020 to ensure energy efficiency.
This included upgrading the gas
boiler at our Manukau village
and continuing our LED upgrade
programme. In addition, we joined
the New Zealand Green Building
Council to ensure optimal energy
performance for new builds.

OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY

WASTE

Governance

Minimising our waste to landfill
Reducing the amount of waste
we send to landfill is an ongoing
focus for our offices, operations and
construction activities. In operations
we achieved a 35% diversion
from landfill, and in construction
the figure was 30%.The Ellerslie
construction site achieved a 75%
avoidance. As a result of this focus
on recycling, our facilities now send
25% less waste to landfill per resident
compared to our 2017 base year.

Roles and responsibilities

TRAVEL
Being more efficient in the way
we travel
Travel emissions are calculated for
car hire and air travel. Compared to
2019 we achieved a 50% decrease
in emissions from domestic, shorthaul and international flights in 2020.
This was due to COVID-19 travel
restrictions and the increased use of
communications technology.
PAPER
Reducing our paper consumption
Our paper use went up due to the
increase in printed communications
during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
However, invoices are now sent via
email to 51% of residents, up from
17% at the beginning of 2020.
FERTILISERS
Selecting environmentally
friendly fertilisers
Fertilisers are a small but visible part
of our emissions profile. We continue
to reduce our fertiliser emissions by
working with our landscaping teams,
gardeners and suppliers to ensure
we use products that have a low
carbon footprint.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Financial performance overview
Underlying profit for the year
ended 31 December 2020
decreased by 7% on the prior
year to $98.3 million (2019:
$106.2 million), driven principally
by significant additional operational
costs associated with COVID-19
to ensure our residents remained
safe, increased investment in care,
employee wages and penal rates,
and cost drag from opening new
villages and main buildings.
Our sales of new and existing units
were strong, with increased volumes
for both. We also saw increased
sale prices on our resale units,
reflecting the strong residential
property market. The margin on new
units reduced due to changes in
the mix of units sold, with more
needs-based products and more
regional sales.
Revenue for the year grew 12% to
$172.4 million (2019: $153.9 million),
reflecting the opening of three new
villages and two main buildings,
and strong financial performance
across village operations. Our care
occupancy rates in established
villages remained high despite a
small reduction following the two
COVID-19 lockdowns.
Underlying profit is a non-GAAP
measure. A detailed explanation is
included in Note 2 to the Financial
Statements (see page 49). In
general terms, underlying profit
removes the fair value movement of
investment property and reinstates
the realised gains associated with
our resales and the development
margin associated with our new
sales. Underlying profit is used to
determine the dividend pay-out
to shareholders.
COVID-19 impact
COVID-19 had a significant impact
on 2020 underlying profit. Increased
operational costs of over $9 million
were predominantly from additional

staff resources, pandemic kits and
personal protective equipment.
This included additional care and
housekeeping staff, a $2 per hour
wage increase during level four
lockdown, security at our sites, and
extra sick leave as a precaution for
staff either because of their health or
that of their close contacts.
The costs outlined above are some
of the direct costs related to our
response, but we also incurred a
number of indirect costs. These
include the cost of paying the
construction staff during lockdown
while they were unable to be on
site and significant investment in
marketing and sales post lockdown
to support our sales teams to
ensure our sales were successful.
There were also no sales during the
national lockdown.
In May we received $0.7 million as
part of the Government’s support
to aged care providers for the
additional costs incurred. We note
that this is considerably less than our
actual costs to date. We qualified
for the COVID-19 wage subsidy as
revenue fell by more than 30% in
April, when retirement unit sales fell
to zero, and received $8.6 million.
However, we repaid this in full once
it became clear the business was in
a stable financial position and the
outlook was positive.
Sales were significantly better
than expected once the country
came out of lockdown, with the
third and fourth quarters bringing
record sales and the business
continuing to perform well. While
we have not yet experienced the
economic downturn predicted by
many economists, we are wary
that COVID-19 will be with us for
some time. We will continue to
plan and prepare to ensure we are
well positioned to deal with any
future outbreaks.

Underlying profit has
seen a compound
annual growth rate of
32% since the company
was listed on the NZX
in 2011
Long-term growth
A key component of underlying
profit is the realised development
margin on new sales which was
$48.2 million in 2020 (2019:
$61.0 million). The development
margin was 19.6%, down from
27.9% in the previous year. The
decrease was due to increased
construction costs across our main
centres, an increase in needsbased products and fewer Auckland
settlements. The long-term returns
remain strong on needs-based
products. Summerset’s mediumterm expectation of development
margins is in the 20–25% range.
This will continue to be an area
of significant focus for the Board
and management.
Good margins reflect the
advantage of having strong
in-house capabilities for each
stage of village development,
including land purchase,
planning, consenting, design and
construction management. We
can achieve cost advantages
through scale and standardisation
of development programmes, while
also being able to adapt each project
to local needs and preferences.
Summerset continues to maintain
the largest land bank for a retirement
village operator in New Zealand, and
acquired a new site at Half Moon Bay
in Auckland during 2020. This brings
our total land bank of units to 5,992.

35

Annual Report 2020

36

Summerset had a record sales year,
with 785 unit sales of occupation
rights (2019: 652), 404 of them new
unit sales and 381 resales. Average
gross proceeds per new sale
settlement of $607,000 were down
from $665,000 in 2019 due to the
change in mix of unit type and region
of sales. Realised resale gain
increased by 25% to $46.1 million in
2020. Average gross proceeds per
resale settlement were $464,000,
up 4% from 2019. This reflects the
growth in the residential property
market in some regions, as well as
the length of time taken between
sale of units.
Key development milestones
included the opening of three new
villages: Papamoa Beach (Tauranga),
Te Awa (Napier) and Bell Block (New
Plymouth). For developing villages
still under construction, new unit
sales were strong at Casebrook
(Christchurch), Rototuna (Hamilton)
and Avonhead (Christchurch).
In addition, our Australian sites
acquired to date illustrate
Summerset's commitment to
diversifying into an attractive
overseas growth market.

Summary of sales and
developments
New Zealand’s residential property
market is continuing to hold strong
despite early predictions from
market analysts that the global
pandemic could result in significant
decreases in house prices
nationwide. Prices continued to rise
across most regions, partly fuelled
by low interest rates and strong
buyer demand.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Net profit after tax
Summerset recorded a net profit
after tax of $230.8 million for the year
ended 31 December 2020, up from
$175.3 million in 2019.

Expense breakdown
Employee
expenses 57%

This increase is largely due to the
fair value movement on investment
property (2020: $221.1 million; 2019:
$165.3 million).
Fair value movement in 2020 of
$221.1 million reflects the delivery
of 356 units in the financial
year, the completion of two main
buildings, strong sales rates across
our villages reducing our vacant
stock levels and changes to the
key assumptions applied by the
valuer. Assumption changes in the
period were predominately to short
term growth rates and recycle
frequencies, reflecting the tailwinds
seen in the residential property
market across the second half
of 2020.

were $60.8 million in 2020
(2019: $52.5 million). The growth
reflects the increase in the
number, occupancy and value of
Summerset’s portfolio of units.

Occupancy in our mature
care centres

At 31 December 2020, Summerset’s
total unit portfolio reached 4,442
(2019: 4,086) and at year end there
were only 179 new sales units and 73
resale units available for sale.
The final apartment building in
Summerset’s Ellerslie village is due
for delivery in early 2021, and
comprises a further 74 apartments.
Strong progress has also been made
on two main buildings in Avonhead
and Richmond, both due to open
in 2021.
38

Occupancy in our mature care
centres was 96% which is above the
industry average of 90%.
Total expenses increased in 2020
by 22% to $158.3 million (2019:
$130.2 million), largely due to
COVID-19 costs and cost drag
of new care centres and villages
opening in line with Summerset's
ongoing business growth. We also
invested in our employee offering
and culture to ensure we remain
a top employer, we had increased
uncontrollable expenditure items
such as rates and power, and
spent more on additional sales and
marketing expenses.

Operating activities
Summerset’s net cash from
operating activities was
$266.8 million for the year, up 12%
from 2019 (2019: $237.9 million).
This was principally driven by
gross receipts from new occupation
right agreement sales, amounting
to $237.0 million, up from
$209.4 million in 2019.
Summerset is a growth company
and reinvests operating cash flows
back into the business to finance
future growth. In 2020 Summerset
invested $318.8 million, primarily
in new and existing retirement
villages and care centres (2019:
$327.4 million).
Investment activities are principally
the purchase of land and the
development and refurbishment of
new and existing retirement villages
and care centres.
Assets rose to $3.9 billion
Total assets rose 17% to $3.9 billion
at 31 December 2020 (2019:
$3.3 billion), mainly due to growth
in the size and value of Summerset’s
investment property, which reached
$3.6 billion (2019: $3.1 billion).
At balance date, Summerset also
had other property, plant and
equipment valued at $181.1 million
(2019: $154.0 million), most of
this being care centres (these
are operated to provide services
and are therefore not included as
investment property).
An increased embedded value of
$883.6 million (2019: $752.7 million)
demonstrates future cash that can
be generated when units are resold.

Interest-bearing debt of
$687.1 million was 18% of total assets
at year end (2019: $587.1 million).
Summerset raised $150.0 million
from a new retail bond in September
2020 which brings the year end debt
at face value to $297.6 million of
bank borrowings and $375.0 million
of retail bonds.
Summerset also has residents' loans
of $1.5 billion (2019: $1.3 billion).
This in the form of licences paid
by residents under occupation right
agreements, these are repayable
when residents vacate units and
the associated occupation rights
are resold.
Consistent strong
growth performance
Summerset continued to pay
dividends to shareholders during
COVID-19 despite unprecedented
circumstances. We will pay a final
dividend of 7.0 cents per share (cps)
on 22 March 2021, making a full payout for the 2020 year of 13.0 cps
(2019: 14.1 cps).
Board policy remains for shareholder
distributions in the range of 30–50%
of each year’s underlying profit. The
2020 distribution of $29.7 million
represents 30% of underlying profit
($98.3 million), which is consistent
with the last five years.
Summerset continues to
offer shareholders a dividend
reinvestment option, including a 2%
discount to market share price.

meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by other entities.
The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure in addition to IFRS profit to assist readers in determining the realised
and unrealised components of fair value movement of investment property, impairment and tax expense in the Group’s income
statement. The measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures to monitor performance and make investment
decisions. Underlying profit is a measure that the Group uses consistently across reporting periods. Underlying profit is used to
determine the dividend pay-out to shareholders.
This statement presented is for the Group, prepared in accordance with the Basis of preparation: underlying profit described below.

Basis of preparation: underlying profit
Underlying profit is determined by taking profit for the period determined under NZ IFRS, adjusted for the impact of the following:
a)

Less fair value movement of investment property: reversal of investment property valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS
profit for the period, which comprise both realised and non-realised valuation movements. This is reversed and replaced with
realised development margin and realised resale gains during the period, effectively removing the unrealised component of
the fair value movement of investment property.

b)

Add impairment of assets: remove the impact of non-cash care centre valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS profit for the
period. Care centres are valued at least every three years (last valued as at 31 December 2020), with fair value gains flowing
through to the revaluation reserve unless the gain offsets a previous impairment to fair value that was recorded in NZ IFRS profit
for the period. Where there is any impairment of a care centre, or reversal of a previous impairment that impacts NZ IFRS profit
for the period, this is eliminated for the purposes of determining underlying profit.

c)

Add realised gain on resales: add the realised gains across all resales of occupation rights during the period. The realised
gain for each resale is determined to be the difference between the licence price for the previous occupation right for a
retirement unit and the occupation right resold for that same retirement unit during the period. Realised resale gains are a
measure of the cash generated from increases in selling prices of occupation rights to incoming residents, less cash amounts
repaid to vacated residents for the repayment of the price of their refundable occupation right purchased in an earlier
period, with the recognition point being the cash settlement. Realised resale gains exclude deferred management fees and
refurbishment costs.

d)

Add realised development margin: add realised development margin across all new sales of occupation rights during the
period, with the recognition point being the cash settlement. Realised development margin is the margin earned on the first
time sale of an occupation right following the development of a retirement unit. The margin for each new sale is determined
to be the licence price for the occupation right, less the cost of developing that retirement unit.

49

Annual Report 2020

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Components of the cost of developing units include directly attributable construction costs and a proportionate share of the
following costs:
•

Infrastructure costs

•

Land cost on the basis of the purchase price of the land

•

Interest during the build period

•

Head office costs directly related to the construction of units

All costs above include non-recoverable GST.
Development margin excludes the costs of developing common areas within the retirement village (including a share of the
proportionate costs listed above). This is because these areas are assets that support the sale of occupation rights for not just
the new sale but for all subsequent resales. It also excludes the costs of developing care centres, which are treated as property,
plant and equipment for accounting purposes.
Where costs are apportioned across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the
nature of the cost.
e)

Add/(less) deferred tax expense/(credit): reversal of the impact of deferred taxation.
Underlying profit does not include any adjustments for abnormal items or fair value movements on financial instruments that
are included in NZ IFRS profit for the period.

3. Segment reporting
The Group operates in one industry, being the provision of integrated retirement villages. The services provided across all of the
Group’s villages are similar, as are the type of customer and the regulatory environment. The chief operating decision makers, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors, review the operating results of the Group as a whole on a regular basis. On
this basis, the Group has one reportable segment, and the Group results are the same as the results of the reportable segment. All
resource allocation decisions across the Group are made to optimise the consolidated Group’s result.

50

The Group continues to proceed with its expansion into Australia. Two Australian sites were purchased in 2019. It is intended that
these sites will be developed into retirement villages. To date the expenditure incurred and assets acquired in Australia have been
immaterial to the Group and so are not reported as a separate operating segment as at 31 December 2020.
The Ministry of Health is a significant customer of the Group, as the Group derives care fee revenue in respect of eligible government
subsidised aged care residents. Fees earned from the Ministry of Health for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to
$36.2 million (2019: $32.2 million). No other customers individually contribute a significant proportion of the Group revenue. All
revenue is earned in New Zealand.

4. Revenue
Care fees and village services income are recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Deferred management fees, which entitle residents to accommodation and the use of the community facilities within the village,
are recognised over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue.
The expected periods of tenure, being based on historical Group averages, are estimated to be seven to eight years for villas,
five years for apartments, three years for serviced apartments and memory care apartments and two years for care suites. Where
the deferred management fees over the contractual period exceed the amortisation of the deferred management fee based on
estimated tenure, the amount is recorded as a liability (revenue in advance). At balance date, the majority of the revenue in advance
balance is non-current. Deferred management fees are recognised on a gross basis in the receipts for residents’ loans section of the
statement of cash flows.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Employee expenses include post-employment benefits (KiwiSaver/Superannuation) of $2.3 million (2019: $2.0 million).
During the year the Group received a $8.6 million one-off Government wage subsidy in relation to COVID-19. The subsidy related
to a 12-week period between March and June 2020. Although the Group was entitled to receive the wage subsidy, the Directors
subsequently determined that it was appropriate to return the subsidy back to the Government and the full $8.6 million was repaid
on 23 December 2020. This resulted in a net nil impact to other operating expenses for the year ended 31 December 2020.
The Group also received an additional $0.7 million of funding as part of the Government's package to support residential aged care
providers to keep COVID-19 at bay. This funding has been recorded as a deduction to other operating expenses.
Included in the above operating expenses is $9.2 million of additional costs incurred as a result of COVID-19.

Annual Report 2020

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Borrowing costs are capitalised for property, plant and equipment (Note 9), and investment property (Note 11), if they are directly
attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities
to prepare the asset commence and expenditure and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Borrowing costs of $12.3 million (2019: $10.5 million) have been capitalised during the period of construction in the current year. The
weighted average capitalisation rate on funds borrowed representing the borrowing costs of the loans used to finance projects is
3.15% per annum (2019: 3.87% per annum).
Two of the Group's retail bonds are designated in a fair value hedging relationship. Details of fair value hedging are included in Note 14.

7. Income tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax, calculated using the tax rate enacted or substantively enacted at balance date and
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, except when it relates to
items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the tax expense is recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax expense is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable it will be utilised. Temporary differences for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit, unless they arise from business combination, are not provided for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
(f) Income tax legislation amendments during the period
During the period, the Income Tax Act 2007 in New Zealand was amended to restore tax depreciation deductions for non-residential
buildings. This amendment resulted in a $6.0 million credit to tax expense during the period and a corresponding reduction in the
deferred tax liability related to property, plant and equipment.

8. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Trade receivables are not significant on an individual
basis and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate, less
an allowance for impairment. The allowance for doubtful debts is made up of expected credit losses based on assessment of trade
receivables debt at the individual level for impairment, plus an additional allowance on the remaining balance for potential credit
losses not yet identified. The expected credit losses allowance requirement on the remaining balance has been set at 2%.

9. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes care centres, both complete and under development, and corporate assets held.
All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
of the asset. The cost of self-constructed care centres includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to
bring the care centres to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest
during the build period and head office costs directly related to the construction of the care centres. Where costs are apportioned
across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, completed care centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of the
revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on care centres and accumulated impairment losses, if any, since the
assets were last revalued. Other corporate assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses, if any. Where an item of plant and equipment is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the income statement is calculated
as the difference between the net sales price and the carrying amount of the asset.
Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence, which is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged
between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction as at the valuation date.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset
previously recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement unless it directly offsets
a previous surplus in the same asset in other comprehensive income. Any accumulated depreciation at revaluation date is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal,
any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings. Independent valuations are
performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the asset’s fair value at the
balance sheet date.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line (SL) basis over the estimated useful life of each item of property,
plant and equipment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values
are reassessed at each reporting date.
Major depreciation rates are as follows:
•
•

Buildings (2% to 13% SL)
Motor vehicles (10% SL)

•
•

Furniture and fittings (7% to 20% SL)
Plant and equipment (2% to 50% SL)

Also included in the buildings category is building fit-out.
Right of use assets are depreciated on a SL basis over the term of their lease. Refer to Note 16.

Buildings include $16.9 million of care centres under development carried at cost at 31 December 2020 (2019: $20.4 million). Right

Annual Report 2020

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Transfer
As at 31 December 2020, a number of care rooms have been decommissioned as they are to be converted to serviced apartments
and accordingly have been transferred from property, plant and equipment to investment property. The care rooms were transferred
to investment property at their fair value which totalled $2.5 million. An impairment loss of $0.2 million was recognised on transfer
via the revaluation reserve.

Revaluations
An independent valuation to determine the fair value of all completed care centres that are classified as land and buildings was
carried out as at 31 December 2020 by CBRE Limited ("CBRE NZ"), an independent registered valuer. Valuations are carried out every
three years unless there are indicators of a significant change in fair value. CBRE NZ determines the fair value of all care centre
assets using an earnings-based multiple approach and the amount apportioned to goodwill of $18.9 million is not recognised (2017:
$16.8 million). Significant assumptions used in the most recent valuation include market value per care bed of between $71,300 and
$231,600, and individual unit earning capitalisation rate of between 11.0% and 13.5%.
As the fair value of land and buildings is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised property, plant
and equipment as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolios of land and buildings are the capitalisation rates applied to individual unit earnings and the market value
per care bed. A significant decrease (increase) in the capitalisation rate would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value
measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the market value per care bed would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair
value measurement.

Cost model

10. Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a SL basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date
that they are available for use. The intangible assets are software and the amortisation rates at 31 December 2020 are between 10-20%
SL basis.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
11. Investment property
Investment property is held to earn current and future rental income (deferred management fees). It comprises land and buildings,
and associated equipment and furnishings, relating to retirement villages and common facilities in the retirement village. Investment
property includes buildings under development, excluding care centres under development, which are included in property, plant
and equipment. Initial recognition of investment property is at cost and it is subsequently measured at fair value, with any change
in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The cost of retirement villages includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to bring the retirement
villages to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest during the
build period and head office costs directly related to the construction of the retirement villages. Where costs are apportioned across
more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Land acquired with the intention of constructing investment property on it is classified as investment property from the date
of acquisition.
Rental income from investment property, being deferred management fees, is accounted for as described in Note 4.
Depreciation is not charged on investment property.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.

of land have been accounted for at cost, which has been determined to be fair value due to the proximity of the transaction to balance date. At 31 December 2020 the land
at cost was $9.9 million (2019: $74.9 million).

Manager's net interest

The Group is unable to reliably determine the fair value of non-land retirement villages under development at 31 December 2020 and
therefore these are carried at cost. This equates to $330.0 million of investment property (2019: $221.0 million).

The fair value of investment property as at 31 December 2020 was determined by independent registered valuers CBRE Limited
("CBRE NZ") and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited ("JLL") for villages including land in New Zealand and CBRE Valuations Pty Limited
("CBRE AU") for land in Australia. The fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on a semi-annual basis, based on
market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing
buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably,
prudently and without compulsion.
As required by NZ IAS 40 - Investment Property, the fair value as determined by the independent registered valuer is adjusted for
assets and liabilities already recognised on the balance sheet which are also reflected in the cash flow analysis.
To assess the fair value of the Group's interest in each New Zealand village, CBRE NZ and JLL have undertaken a cash flow analysis
to derive a net present value. The Group's development land has been valued by CBRE NZ using the direct comparison approach.
Each valuer continues to review market conditions in relation to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Since 30 June 2020 the level
of uncertainty and unknown impact has decreased with markets becoming more used to operating under COVID-19 conditions.
Because of this, the valuers have reversed their COVID-19 specific adjustments relating to near term growth rates and recycle
frequencies when determining value at 31 December 2020.
The valuers' view is that the longer-term economic impact as a result of COVID-19 on the New Zealand aged care sector still remains
largely unknown with comparable transactions and market evidence since the outbreak limited. Therefore they advise that a higher
degree of caution should be exercised when relying upon the valuation.
Significant assumptions used by CBRE NZ and JLL in relation to the New Zealand investment property include a discount rate of
between 13.5% and 16.5% (2019: 13.5% to 16.5%), and a long-term nominal house price inflation rate (growth rate) of between 0% and
3.5% (2019: 0% to 3.5%). Other assumptions used include the average entry age of residents of between 72 years and 90 years (2019:
72 years and 91 years), and the stabilised departing occupancy periods of units of between 3.7 years and 9.0 years (2019: 3.6 years
and 8.8 years).
Two sites under development in Australia have been valued separately by CBRE AU. The Cranbourne North land was valued under
the same methodology as development land in New Zealand. The Torquay land was valued under a modified direct comparison
approach which takes into account the gross realisation of the proposed units 'as if complete'.
As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised investment
property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
To assess the market value of the Group's interest in a retirement village, CBRE and JLL have undertaken a cash flow analysis to
derive a net present value. As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are significant and unobservable,
the Group has categorised investment property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 - Fair
Value Measurement.
The sensitivities of the significant assumptions are shown in the table below:

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Other key components in determining the fair value of investment property are the average entry age of residents and the average
occupancy of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the occupancy period of units would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair
value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents would result in a significantly higher
(lower) fair value measurement.

Operating expenses
Direct operating expenses arising from investment property during the period amounted to $41.1 million (2019: $34.3 million).

Security
At 31 December 2020, all investment property relating to registered retirement villages under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are
subject to a registered first mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor to secure the Group’s obligations to the occupation right
agreement holders.

14. Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swaps are initially
recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value on each reporting date.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined based on cash flows discounted to present value using current market
interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its floating rate debt. These interest
rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. When interest rate swaps meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective
portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to reserves are transferred out of reserves and included in the
measurement of the hedged transaction when the forecast transaction occurs. When interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria
for cash flow hedge accounting, all movements in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.

Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
variable rates and to pay interest at fixed rates. At 31 December 2020, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with a
total notional principal amount of $337.0 million (2019: $377.0 million). Of the swaps in place, at 31 December 2020 $312.0 million
(2019: $292.0 million) are being used to cover approximately 45% (2019: 49%) of the floating rate debt principal outstanding. These
agreements effectively change the Group’s interest exposure on the principal covered by the interest rate swaps from a floating rate
to fixed rates, which range between 1.22% and 3.87% (2019: 1.22% and 4.43%).
The fair value of these agreements at 31 December 2020 is a $28.2 million liability, comprised of $29.2 million of swap liabilities and
$1.0 million of swap assets (2019: liability of $21.1 million, comprised of $22.6 million of swap liabilities and $1.5 million of swap assets).
Of this, a liability of $274,000 is estimated to be current (2019: $515,000). The agreements cover notional amounts for terms of up
to eight years.
The notional principal amounts and the period of expiry of the cash flow hedge interest rate swap contracts are as follows:

Fair value hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its fixed rate debt arising from the retail
bonds. The hedge is for the future fair value movements in the retail bonds as a result of market interest rate movements. The Group
has designated $225.0 million of its retail bonds in fair value hedge relationships.
Both the hedging instrument (interest rate swap) and the hedged risk are recognised at fair value. The change in the fair value of both
items offset in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent the hedging relationship is effective. The increase in fair value
of the interest rate swaps of $5.8 million (2019: $8.0 million) has been recognised in finance costs and has been offset with a similar
fair value loss on the retail bonds to leave an ineffective amount in finance costs of $13,000 (2019: $92,000).
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
fixed rates and to pay interest at floating rates. At 31 December 2020, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with
a total notional principal amount of $225.0 million (2019: $225.0 million). Of the interest rate swaps in place, at 31 December 2020
$225.0 million (2019: $225.0 million) are being used to cover 60% (2019: 100%) of the fixed interest rate retail bonds outstanding.

15. Residents' loans
Residents’ loans are amounts payable under occupation right agreements. An occupation right agreement confers a right of
occupancy to a villa, apartment, serviced apartment, care suite or memory care apartment. The consideration received on the grant
of an occupation right agreement is allocated to the resident’s loan in full. These loans are non-interest-bearing and are payable when
both an occupation right agreement is terminated and there has been settlement of a new occupation right agreement for the same
retirement unit and the proceeds from the new settlement have been received by the Group. Residents’ loans are initially recognised
at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

62

The Group holds a contractual right to set-off the deferred management fee receivable on termination of an agreement against the
resident’s loan to be repaid. Residents’ loans are therefore recognised net of the deferred management fee receivable on the balance
sheet. Deferred management fees are payable by residents in consideration for the supply of accommodation and the right to share
in the use of community facilities. Deferred management fees are paid in arrears, with the amount payable calculated as a percentage
of the resident’s loan amount as per the resident’s occupation right agreement. Deferred management fee receivable is calculated
and recorded based on the current tenure of the resident and the contractual right to deferred management fee earned at balance
date. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on recognition of deferred management fee revenue.

16. Leases
The leases to which NZ IFRS 16 applies are the leases of office premises and car parks occupied by the Group in New Zealand and
Australia. In respect of these leases, a right of use asset is disclosed along with a corresponding lease liability. The right of use assets
are depreciated on a SL basis, while the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not yet paid,
discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.
The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of office spaces, car parks and
information technology equipment that have a lease term of 12 months or less, or as a transitional expedient, have less than 12 months
left on the lease term as at the date of application of NZ IFRS 16. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these
leases as incurred as a rental expense over the lease term.

Right of use assets are classified as property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities are disclosed as such in the Group's statement
of financial position.
The following practical expedients have been utilised in relation to the Group's operating leases as lessee:
•

A single discount rate has been applied to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics

•

Leases with a term ending within 12 months of the date of application have been treated as short term leases

•

Initial direct costs have been excluded from the measurement of the right of use asset at the date of initial application

•

Exclusion of leases for which the underlying asset is of low value

The weighted average incremental borrowing rates used to measure lease liabilities at the date of application are between 3.80%
and 4.67% (2019: 4.17% and 4.67%).
When the Group has the option to extend a lease, management uses its judgement to determine whether or not an option would be
reasonably certain to be exercised. Management considers all facts and circumstances, including their past practice and any cost
that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help determine the lease term. Other assumptions and
judgements used by management include calculating the appropriate discount rate.
As a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic the Group, as a lessee, received $60,000 in rent concessions over a three-month
period from April to June 2020. Management has applied the COVID-19 practical expedient, issued by the IASB in May 2020, and has
accounted for the rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications. The rent concessions have instead been accounted for
as a reduction to operating expenses.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
As a lessor
The Group acts as a lessor under occupation right agreements with village residents, along with a small amount of residential
rental properties. The assets leased by the group as a lessor are disclosed as investment property and lease income on occupation
right agreements is generated in the form of deferred management fees. The lease term is determined to be the greater of the
expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue. The Group uses the portfolio approach to account for leases of units
to village residents and allocates individual leases to different portfolios depending on the type of unit. The Group does not have
any sub-leases.

17. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings include secured bank loans and unsubordinated fixed-rate retail bonds.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent
to initial recognition, the borrowings are measured at amortised cost, with any difference between the initial recognised amount and
the redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest rate. The retail
bonds SUM010 and SUM020 are designated in fair value hedge relationships, which means that any change in market interest rates
result in a change in the fair value adjustment on that debt. Retail bond issue expenses, fees and other costs incurred in arranging
retail bond finance are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant debt instrument.

The weighted average interest rate for the year to 31 December 2020 was 3.15% (2019: 3.87%). This includes the impact of interest
rate swaps (see Note 14).
The secured bank loan facility at 31 December 2020 has a limit of approximately NZD$750.0 million (2019: $500.0 million). Lending of
NZ$315.0 million expires in March 2022, AU$120.0 million expires in November 2023 and NZ$310.0 million expires in November 2024.
The Group has issued three retail bonds. The first retail bond was issued for $100.0 million in July 2017 and has a maturity date of
11 July 2023. This retail bond is listed on the NZX Debt Market (NZDX) with the ID SUM010. The second retail bond was issued for
$125.0 million in September 2018 and has a maturity date of 24 September 2025. This retail bond is listed on the NZDX with the ID
SUM020. The third retail bond was issued for $150.0 million in September 2020 and has a maturity date of 21 September 2027. This
retail bond is listed on the NZDX with the ID SUM030.

Security
The banks loans and retail bonds rank equally with the Group’s other unsubordinated obligations and are secured by the following
securities held by a security trustee:
•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is not a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages
Act 2003;

•

a second-ranking registered mortgage over the land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages Act
2003 (behind a first-ranking registered mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor);

•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group member;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the New Zealand- incorporated guaranteeing Group members, but in respect
of which the Statutory Supervisor has first rights to the proceeds of security enforcement against all assets of the registered
retirement villages to which the security trustee is entitled;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group members; and

•

a Specific Security Deed in respect of each marketable security of Summerset Holdings (Australia) Pty Limited, held by
Summerset Holdings Limited.

18. Financial instruments
Exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board reviews and agrees on
policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
The Group has seen no material change in its exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it
will continue to monitor the situation. Further to this, given the Group's status as an 'essential service' during the COVID-19 pandemic,
operations have been allowed to continue largely uninterrupted.

Categories of financial instruments

Financial assets
All financial assets of the Group are classified at amortised cost except for interest rate swaps, which are classified as fair value
through profit and loss, and those assets that are designated in a hedge relationship.

Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities except interest rate swaps and retail bonds are classified as liabilities at amortised cost. Refer to Note 17 for detail
on the retail bonds.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a resident or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual
obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk relates to receivables from residents and bank balances. The Group manages
its exposure to credit risk. The Group’s cash is held with its principal banker; with the level of exposure to credit risk considered
minimal, with low levels of cash generally held. Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and funds are placed
with high-credit-quality financial institutions. The level of risk associated with sundry debtors is considered minimal due to the
recoverability of this balance being assessed as high. The Group does not require collateral from its debtors and the Directors
consider the Group’s exposure to any concentration of credit risk to be minimal.
There has been no instances of residents or counterparties failing to meet their contractual obligations as a direct result of COVID-19.
There has been no change to credit terms and aging of receivables remains consistent with the prior years.

In summary, trade receivables are determined to be impaired as follows:

Market risk
66

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by seeking to obtain the most competitive rate of interest at all times. The Group
has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to provide an effective cash flow hedge against the variability in floating
interest rates. The Group has also entered into other interest swap agreements to reduce interest rate repricing risk in relation to retail
bonds. See Note 14 for details of interest rate swap agreements.
To comply with the Group’s risk management policy, the hedge ratio is based on the interest rate swap notional amount to hedge
the same notional amount of bank loans or retail bonds. This results in a hedge ratio of 1:1. This is the same as used for actual risk
management purposes, and such a ratio is appropriate for the purposes of hedge accounting as it does not result in an imbalance
that would create hedge ineffectiveness.
In these hedge relationships the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
•

a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship;

•

where the hedge instrument has been transacted on a date different to the rate set date of the bank loan or retail bonds, interest
rates could differ; and

•

differences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.

Other than these sources, due to the alignment of the hedged risk in the hedged item and hedged instrument, hedge ineffectiveness
is not expected to arise.
At 31 December 2020 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’s
profit by approximately $2.8 million (2019: decrease by $3.5 million) and increase total comprehensive income by approximately
$8.7 million (2019: increase by $8.0 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity
by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk on residents’ loans and related
sundry debtors through the contractual requirements of occupation rights agreements, whereby a resident’s loan is repaid only on

Total

Residents’ loans are non-interest bearing and are not required to be repaid following termination of an occupation right agreement
until receipt of cash for the new resident loan from the incoming resident. The figures above have been calculated using best
estimates of resident loan repayments based on historical information. To date, cash for new residents’ loans received has always
exceeded cash to repay residents’ loans, net of deferred management fees.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of the Group's assets, liabilities and financial performance will fluctuate due to changes
in foreign currency rates.
67

The Group is primarily exposed to currency risk through its subsidiaries in Australia.
The risk to the Group is that the value of the overseas subsidiaries' financial position and financial performance will fluctuate in
economic terms and as recorded in the Group financial statements due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Due to limited activity
in the Australian subsidiaries in 2020, the Group did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange risk.

The fair value of residents’ loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Future cash flows are based on the assumption
that the average tenure periods are those disclosed above and have been discounted at 14% (2019: 14%). The fair value of residents’
loans is categorised as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of retail bonds is based on the price traded at on the NZX market as at 31 December 2020. The fair value of the retail
bonds is categorised as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using inputs from third parties that are observable, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Based on this, the Company and Group have categorised these financial instruments as Level 2
under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

21. Employee share plans
Senior employee share plan - share option scheme
Effective from 2018, the Group operates an employee share plan granting share options to selected senior employees ("Participants").
The exercise price of the granted share options is determined from the volume weighted average price on the NZX during the 10
trading day period determined by the Board prior to the grant.

1 The first tranche of the December 2018 grant had a vesting date of 31 December 2020.

The performance hurdles for the option grant made in 2020 are based on:

70

•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget)

•

20% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group)

•

10% clinical delivery

•

10% employee initiatives

•

10% customer initiatives

While there is a requirement to remain employed by Summerset up to vesting date, there are no performance hurdles for vesting
of share options to senior management team members, other than the members of the Executive Leadership Team, whose
performance hurdles are described above.
A total of 576,852 options vested at 31 December 2020 (2019: nil) and subsequently became exercisable.
The share option scheme is an equity-settled scheme and measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate
that the share options will vest. These options were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the option cost for the year
ending 31 December 2020 of $980,000 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the Group for that period
(2019: $422,000). The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the share options in cash.

Senior employee share plan - share and loan scheme
Up to and including 2017, the Group operated employee share plans for selected senior employees (“Participants”) to purchase
shares in the Company (the "2013 share plan"). The shares for the plans are held by a nominee as share options on behalf of
Participants, until such time after the vesting of shares that the nominee is directed by the Participant that they wish to exercise the
share option, or the shares are sold or cancelled by the nominee if vesting criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as
all other ordinary shares.
The Group provided Participants with interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the acquisition of the shares for these plans. These
loans are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited and eliminate on consolidation.
The issue price of shares under the 2013 share plan was determined from the volume weighted average price on the NZX during the
ten trading days prior to issue.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Shareholders of Summerset Group
Holdings Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Summerset Group Holdings Limited (“the company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the
Group”) on pages 41 to 74, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2020,
and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in
equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended of the Group, and the notes to the consolidated financial
statements including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 41 to 74 present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2020 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial
Reporting Standards.
This report is made solely to the company's shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company's shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of Ethics for Assurance
Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Ernst & Young provides other assurance related services to the Group. Partners and employees of our firm may deal with the Group
on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. We have no other relationship with, or
interest in, the Group.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of
the audit report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to
respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures,
including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Annual Report 2020

Valuation of investment property and freehold land and buildings
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

As disclosed in notes 9 and 11 to the consolidated
financial statements:

To address the key audit matter, we:

•

the Group’s investment property portfolio was valued
at $3,639 million at 31 December 2020 and included
completed investment property and investment
property under development

•

the Group’s freehold land and buildings were valued
at $155 million at 31 December 2020. This included
freehold land and buildings operated by the Group for
the provision of care services, and land and buildings
to be developed into care facilities in the future.

The Group’s accounting policy is to measure these assets
at fair value.

76

Independent valuations of all investment property and
freehold land and buildings were carried out by third
party valuers, CBRE Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle
Limited (the Valuers). The valuation of investment
property and freehold land and buildings is inherently
subjective given that there are alternative assumptions
and valuation methods that may result in a range of
values. As discussed in note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Valuers have advised that a
degree of caution should be exercised when relying
on the valuations. This caution reflects the ongoing
uncertainty compared to prior years as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Completed investment property and care suites are
recorded in the consolidated financial statements based
on the value determined by the Valuers.

External valuations
•

read the valuation reports and discussed them directly
with the Valuers. We assessed the valuation approach and
confirmed that this was in accordance with the relevant
accounting standards; and

•

tested on a sample basis, whether property specific
information supplied to the Valuers by the Group
reflected the underlying property records held by
the Group.

Assumptions and estimates
•

held discussions with the Valuers to gain an
understanding of the assumptions and estimates
used and the valuation methodology applied. This
included understanding the impact that ongoing market
uncertainty had on their assessment of significant inputs
and assumptions. We also sought to understand and
consider whether any restrictions had been imposed on
the valuation process;

•

considered whether the valuation sought to make
appropriate assumptions for a sample of individual
properties to reflect their characteristics, overall quality,
geographic location and desirability as a whole; and

•

engaged our in-house Real estate valuation experts to
challenge the work performed by the Valuers and assess
the reasonableness of the assumptions used based
on their knowledge gained from reviewing valuations
of similar properties, known transactions and available
market data.

Our work over the assumptions focused on the largest
properties within the portfolio and those properties where the
assumptions used and/or year-on-year fair value movement
suggested a possible outlier compared to the rest of the
portfolio and the market data for the sector.
Valuation estimates
As a result of the judgement involved in determining
valuations for individual properties and the existence of
alternative assumptions and valuation methods, there is a
range of values which can be considered reasonable when
evaluating the independent property valuations used by the
Group. If we identified an error in a property valuation or
determined that the valuation was outside of a reasonable
range, we evaluated the error or difference to determine
if there was a material misstatement in the consolidated
financial statements.
Disclosures
We considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in
notes 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
These notes explain the key judgements made in relation
to the valuation of investment property and freehold land
and buildings and the estimation uncertainty involved in the
valuation process.

Deferred Management Fee Revenue Recognition
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Deferred management fee (“DMF”) revenue is 35% of the
Group's total revenue. The Group recognises deferred
management fee revenue from residents over the longer
of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right
to revenue in accordance with the terms of the resident’s
occupational right agreement.

To address the key audit matter, we:

The amount of revenue recognised in each year is
subject to the Group’s judgement of each resident’s
expected tenure in the village as well as the terms of
the occupational right agreement and the type of unit
occupied. A change in the assumed tenure may have a
material impact on revenue recognised in the year.
Disclosures in relation to DMF revenue and the
associated DMF receivable and revenue in advance
balances are included in note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements.

•

for a sample of residents, assessed the accuracy of a
sample of the inputs to, and calculation of, the DMF
revenue recognised during 2020;

•

agreed the contractual terms used in the revenue
recognition calculation for a sample of residents to the
occupational right agreement;

•

assessed the movements year on year in revenue
recognised by each village based on an expectation
derived from underlying village data;

•

compared the Group’s assessment of assumed tenure
against actual observed tenure; and

•

assessed the adequacy of the related financial
statement disclosures.

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The directors of the company are responsible for the Annual Report, which includes information other than the consolidated financial
statements and auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge
obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based upon the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The directors are responsible, on behalf of the entity, for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial
Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing on behalf of the entity the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

77

Annual Report 2020

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the External Reporting
Board’s website: https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards-for-assurance-practitioners/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Grant Taylor.

Governance
Summerset is committed to following best-practice governance structures and principles and to having good

NZX and ASX.
Summerset has adopted the principles below as an appropriate way to demonstrate its commitment to these
fundamental principles and to illustrate the transparency of the Company’s approach to corporate governance for the
benefit of its Shareholders and other stakeholders. These principles are from the NZX Corporate Governance Code
issued in January 2019 ("NZX Code"). Each principle of the NZX Code is set out below with an explanation on how
Summerset meets each principle.
As at 31 December 2020, Summerset considers that it was in full compliance with NZX Listing Rules and the NZX Code.

arises. If a conflict of interest exists, the Director
concerned will have no involvement in the decisionmaking process relating to the matter.

Ethical standards
The Board maintains high standards of ethical conduct
and expects the Company’s employees to act legally and
with integrity in a manner consistent with the policies,
guiding principles and values that are in place. These
include the following:
•

•

Code of Ethics – This guide sets out the basic
principles of legal and ethical conduct expected of all
employees and Directors. The Company encourages
open and honest communication by staff about any
current or potential problem, complaint, suggestion,
concern or question.

Annual Report 2020

Principle 2: Board composition
and performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be
a balance of independence, skills, knowledge,
experience and perspectives.”
Role of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is elected by Shareholders, and
has responsibility for taking appropriate steps to protect
and enhance the value of the assets of the Company
in the best interests of its Shareholders. The Board has
adopted a formal Board Charter detailing its authority,
responsibilities, membership and operation.

80

The key responsibilities of the Board include setting
the overall direction and strategy of the Company,
establishing appropriate policies and monitoring
performance of management. The Board appoints the
Chief Executive Officer and delegates the day-to-day
operating of the business to the Chief Executive Officer.
The Chief Executive Officer implements policies and
strategies set by the Board and is accountable to it. The
Board also has responsibility for ensuring the Company’s
financial position is sound, financial statements comply
with generally accepted accounting practice, and that
the Company adheres to high standards of ethical and
corporate behaviour.
A summary of the Board mandate is as follows:
•

A majority of the Board should be Independent
Directors as defined in the NZX Listing Rules;

•

The Chair of the Board should be independent;

•

The Chair and the Chief Executive Officer should be
different people;

•

Directors should possess a broad range of skills,
qualifications and experience, and remain current on
how best to perform their duties as Directors;

•

Information of sufficient content, quality and
timeliness as the Board considers necessary shall
be provided by management to allow the Board to
discharge its duties effectively;

•

The effectiveness and performance of the Board and
its individual members should be re-evaluated on an
annual basis.

Directors receive an induction upon appointment to the
Board to ensure their full knowledge of the Company
and the industry in which it operates. The Directors are
expected to keep themselves abreast of changes and
trends in the business and to keep themselves up to date
to ensure they best perform their duties as Directors of
the Company.
All Directors have been issued letters setting out the
terms and conditions of their appointment.
Delegation of authority
The Board delegates to the Chief Executive Officer
responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy
and for managing the Company’s operations. The
Chief Executive Officer and management have Boardapproved levels of authority and, in turn, sub-delegate
authority in some cases to direct reports. This is
documented in the Delegated Authority Policy.
Before approving the Company and Group's financial
statements, a management representation letter is
obtained from the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
declaring that, in their opinion, the financial records of
the Company and Group have been properly maintained
and the financial statements comply with the appropriate
accounting standards and give a true and fair view of
the financial position and performance of the Company
and Group.
Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution and
the NZX Listing Rules, Directors are required to
retire three years after their appointment or at the third
Annual Shareholder Meeting following their appointment
(whichever is later). Directors who have been appointed
by the Board must also retire at the next Annual
Shareholder Meeting following their appointment.
Directors may offer themselves for re-election by
Shareholders each year at the Annual Shareholder
Meeting. Procedures for the appointment and removal
of Directors are also governed by the Constitution.
The People and Culture Committee identifies and
nominates candidates to fill Director vacancies for Board
approval. Information about candidates for election or
re-election is included in the Notice of Meeting to assist
Shareholders in deciding whether or not to elect or reelect the candidate.

Board composition
The Company’s Constitution prescribes that the Board
shall be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, with
at least two Directors ordinarily resident in New Zealand.
As at 31 December 2020, the Board was comprised
of seven non-executive Independent Directors. In
determining whether a Director is Independent, the
Board has regard to the NZX Listing Rules.
The Board considers all current Directors to be
Independent in that they are not executives of the
Company and do not have a direct or indirect interest or
relationship that could reasonably influence, in a material
way, their decisions in relation to the Company.

As at 31 December 2020, the non-executive Independent
Directors were Rob Campbell (Chair), Dr Andrew Wong,
Anne Urlwin, Gráinne Troute, James Ogden, Dr Marie
Bismark and Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley.
The Board is comprised of Directors who have a mix of
skills, knowledge, experience and diversity to adequately
meet and discharge its responsibilities and to add value to
the Company through efficient and effective governance
leadership. The current Directors have a varied and
balanced mix of skills relevant to the Group’s operations.
A summary of the key skills and experience held across
the Board as at 31 December 2020, is set out in the

Annual Report 2020

More information on the Directors, including their
interests, qualifications and security holdings, is provided
in the Board of Directors and Disclosures sections of
this report.
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings. The
Directors generally receive material for Board meetings
five working days in advance, except in the case of special
meetings, for which the time period may be shorter owing
to the urgency of the matter to be considered.
The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings, and
in this capacity is accountable directly to the Board,
through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper
functioning of the Board.
All Directors have access to the Executive Leadership
Team to discuss issues or obtain information on specific
areas in relation to items to be considered at Board
meetings or other areas as considered appropriate. Key
Executives and managers are invited to attend and
participate in appropriate sessions at Board meetings.
Directors have unrestricted access to Company records
and information.

82

Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional
advice relating to the affairs of the Company or other
responsibilities. Prior approval of the Chair is required
before seeking such advice and Directors are expected to
ensure that the cost of such advice is reasonable.
Diversity and inclusion
The Company and its Board are committed to a
workplace culture that promotes and values diversity
and inclusiveness. This is outlined in the Company’s
Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which is available on the
Company’s website.
Diversity is defined as the characteristics that make one
individual different from another. Diversity encompasses
gender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation,
physical capability, family responsibilities, education,
cultural background and more.

Inclusion is defined as a sense of belonging, respecting
and valuing all individuals, providing fair access to
opportunity, and removing discrimination and other
barriers to involvement. The Board recognises that
inclusion leads to a better experience of work for
Summerset’s employees, makes teams stronger, leads
to greater creativity and performance, contributes to
a more meaningful relationship with residents, their
families and stakeholders, and ultimately increases value
to Shareholders.
The Board believes that diversity across the workforce
makes Summerset stronger and better able to connect
with, and bring the best of life to, residents on a day-today basis. When there is a variety of thinking styles,
backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and abilities,
employees are more able to understand residents’ needs
and to respond effectively to them.
The Diversity and Inclusion Policy establishes the
following objectives for achieving diversity:
•

Facilitate and promote equal employment
opportunities at all levels, and identify and remove
any barriers to equal opportunity;

•

Facilitate and promote a merit-based environment in
which all employees have the opportunity to develop
and perform to their full potential; and

•

Reward excellence and ensure all employees are
treated fairly, evaluated objectively, and have
equitable access to opportunities for progression and
promotion on the basis of performance.

achieving diversity have been met.
As at 31 December 2020 (and 31 December 2019 for the
prior comparative period), the mix of gender of those
employed by the Company is set out in the table above.
Senior Managers of the Company are the Chief Executive
Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer. The Executive Leadership Team
comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
and all General Managers who report to the Chief
Executive Officer.
These figures include permanent full-time, permanent
part-time, fixed-term and casual employees, but not
independent contractors.

Board performance
The Board is committed to evaluating its performance on
a regular basis, generally with a formal, external review
bi-annually with an internal self-review each intervening
year. In 2020 the Board completed an externallyfacilitated review which provided the opportunity
for directors to independently evaluate board and
committee performance and processes as well as to give
individual feedback on and to each director. The process,
including evaluation criteria, is considered by the People
and Culture Committee and approved by the Board.
Executive Leadership Team performance
The Board evaluates annually the performance of the
Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer
reviews the performance of direct reports and reports
to the Board on those reviews. The evaluation is
based on criteria that include the performance of
the business and the accomplishment of longer-term
strategic objectives. It may include quantitative and
qualitative measures. During the most recent financial
year, performance evaluations were conducted in
accordance with this process.

83

Annual Report 2020

Principle 4: Reporting and disclosure Principle 6: Risk management
“The board should demand integrity in financial and
non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and
balance of corporate disclosures.”
Making timely and balanced disclosures
The Company is committed to promoting Shareholder
confidence through open, timely and accurate market
communication. The Company has in place procedures
designed to ensure compliance with its disclosure
obligations under the NZX and ASX Listing Rules. The
Company’s Market Disclosure and Communications
Policy sets out the responsibilities of the Board and
management in disclosure and communication, and
procedures for managing this obligation.
Copies of key governance documents, including
the Code of Ethics, Securities Trading Policy
and Guidelines, Board and Committee Charters,
Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Board and Executive
Remuneration Policy, and Market Disclosure and
Communications Policy are all available on the
Company’s website at https://www.summerset.co.nz/
investor-centre/governance-documents/.
86

Non-financial disclosures, such as the Company’s
approach to health and safety, our people, the
community and the environment are included within
this Annual Report. The Company recognises it is in the
early stages of reporting on non-financial information,
and intends to continue to enhance future disclosure in
this area.

“Directors should have a sound understanding of the
material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage
them. The Board should regularly verify that the issuer
has appropriate processes that identify and manage
potential and material risks.”
Summerset has robust risk management and reporting
frameworks in place whereby material business risks are
regularly identified, monitored and managed. The Board
reviews this risk management framework on an annual
basis to ensure it remains fit for purpose. A review was
undertaken by the Board during the 2020 financial year.
The members of Summerset’s Executive Leadership
Team are required to regularly identify the major
risks affecting the business, record them in the risk
register (which identifies the likelihood and consequence
of each risk to Summerset’s business), and develop
structures, practices and processes to manage and
monitor these risks.
Summerset has introduced a co-sourced model for
internal audit with an in-house Internal Audit Manager
appointed. As part of the co-sourced model, Summerset
has engaged KPMG as its partner to assist with carrying
out internal audit work on various parts of the Group’s
operations and all major risk and internal control issues
are reported on at each Board meeting.

“The remuneration of directors and executives should
be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Health and safety (including in relation to risks,
performance and management) is discussed regularly
at Board meetings and specific reviews are sought as
required. Monthly reporting is prepared and used to assist
in risk management, covering areas such as health and
safety incidents, injury and near miss frequency rates, and
actions undertaken. Further information is covered in the
health and safety section of this Annual Report.

Remuneration of Directors and the Executive Leadership
Team is reviewed by the Board’s People and Culture
Committee. Its membership and role are set out under
Principle 3. The Committee makes recommendations
to the Board on remuneration packages, keeping in
mind the requirements of the Board and Executive
Remuneration Policy. The level of remuneration paid to
the Directors and the Executive Leadership Team will
be determined by the Board. However, Directors’ fees
must be within the limits approved by the Shareholders of
the Company.

Summerset has a Tax Governance Policy in place which
sets out its tax risk management objectives, tax reporting
requirements to the Audit Committee and policies and
processes to manage tax risk. This Tax Governance
Policy is reviewed by the Board every two years. It
is next due for review in December 2022. The Board
is satisfied that Summerset has effective policies and
processes in place to ensure the Company is meeting
its obligations. Summerset adopts a risk averse stance in
relation to tax issues and, where possible, seeks certainty
on tax positions through proactive engagement with
tax authorities.

Summerset has considered whether it has any

Corporate Governance Principles) and has determined
the following:
•

Climate change risk: Over the longer term,
Summerset expects to operate in a climate that will
progressively depart from the weather conditions
and events currently experienced, to more acute
challenges and risks arising from increasing climate
variability. This is likely to have various impacts on
the longer-term plans and operation of the Group
– specifically in relation to the design, build and
construction of villages, as well as in the provision of
care services to frail residents and the overall lifestyle
satisfaction enjoyed in Summerset’s villages.
Summerset responds to these risks in the
following way:
•

Summerset is a certified carbonzero organisation.
This requires us to measure our greenhouse
gas emissions, understand our carbon liabilities,
and put in place management plans to reduce
emissions within the organisation and more widely
through our supply chain.

•

The Company is structured internally with two
key working groups in place. One which focuses

on future proofing our designs, understanding
emerging risks and improving our resilience, with
the other responsible for implementing specific
actions and initiatives identified in our emissions
reduction plan. Both of these working groups
report into the Sustainability Forum who report
through to the Board on sustainability strategy and
targets, including our key climate-related targets
and risks.
•

Climate change considerations are integrated
into the due diligence process for potential
acquisitions to assess the climate change risks
inherent at each site.

•

Climate related risks are included within our
corporate risk matrix.

•

The Board has oversight of climate-related issues
and responsibility for sustainability.

These measures and our approach to sustainability
are discussed in more detail on page 31 of this report.

Annual Report 2020

•

Property market risk: Property market factors could
adversely affect sales, occupancy levels or revenue
streams. This may have a flow on impact to the value
of Summerset’s property assets and the associated
investment property valuation, which would in turn
impact Summerset’s financial performance.

•

Staff retention and capability risk: In a tight
and highly competitive labour market, Summerset
is at risk of staff shortages. Key areas within
our construction and nursing teams will continue
to be monitored closely. Given COVID-19, this is
currently not considered an extreme risk, but one
for consideration in the medium to long term.

•

Corporate governance and compliance: Changes
in regulation could have a material impact on
Summerset’s business operations. Summerset's
governance procedures are continually monitored.
Failure to comply with regulatory, societal and
investor expectations in relation to corporate
and environmental sustainability could impact
Summerset’s reputation and financial performance
over the longer term.

•

88

Strategy and innovation: There is a moderate risk
with regard to Summerset’s strategic direction and
ability to continue to innovate. Summerset’s intention
is to stay at the forefront in all areas of its business
including technology, design, development and care.
However, there is a risk that a competitor may bring
something new to market.

•

Diversity and inclusion: Developments in our
diversity and inclusion strategy mean there is some
level of risk in terms of fulfilling all our obligations
in this area, especially in a tight labour market. This
needs to be monitored closely and the staff survey will
bring out useful research and information in this area.

•

COVID-19: The unknown factors surrounding the
COVID-19 pandemic mean this remains a high-risk
area at the time of writing this report. However,
global research and work on various vaccines, better
management of care overall and New Zealand’s
positive response to date all mean we are in a good
position. The risk of community transmission and
moving alert levels remains.

•

Construction and development risk: Summerset
faces construction and property development risks
when developing new villages. These risks include
project delays, default risk, governance and design
risk and potential labour and materials shortages.

•

Care: This is a high-risk area for Summerset,
which requires constant monitoring, management
and policy review. Good training and professional
development, retention of staff and investment into
health and safety all help mitigate risk in this area.

•

Resident and customer experience: Providing top
level resident and customer experience at all times

is a challenge due to the nature of the organisation.
Summerset has various methods in which it manages
and monitors these issues closely, including move-in
surveys, on-going resident feedback surveys, close
one-on-one feedback sessions and close contact with
residents, families, next of kin and prospects.
•

Occupational health and safety risk: This remains a
material risk. Its importance has increased further this
year for staff given the mental health risks associated
with the uncertainty of COVID-19. The physical and
mental wellbeing of all Summerset staff is one of our
top priorities.

•

Australia market entry: Entering a new market
requires a measured and well researched approach.
Summerset is mitigating many new market entry
risks by setting up a new local team, entering a
well-researched market and developing product and
service offerings, procedures and processes tailored
for the new market. Progress in Australia will be
closely managed.

•

Data privacy and confidentiality: Summerset
actively monitors and manages these risks through
the risk management and reporting frameworks.

•

Asset maintenance and upgrades: Summerset has
a co-ordinated approach to asset management and
upgrades in all areas of the business. This is constantly
up for review and progress is managed accordingly.

•

Sector penetration rates: Summerset is fortunate to
operate in the high growth New Zealand retirement
sector. The risk is a declining penetration (or
participation) in the market. Current forecasts show
this is unlikely to be the case in New Zealand but is a
risk to be monitored. Competitors making significant
changes to their revenue models or pricing strategy
could impact on the revenue earned by Summerset.

•

Reputational risk: Summerset operates in a sensitive
market involving care of vulnerable members of
society. Summerset’s performance and reputation
could be adversely impacted should it suffer adverse
publicity, particularly in respect of care or health and
safety issues.

Principle 7: Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and
independence of the external audit process.”
The Board’s relationship with its auditors, both external
and internal, is governed by the Audit Committee Charter,
External Audit Independence Policy and the Internal
Audit Charter. These charters and policies set out the
types of engagements that can be performed by the
external and internal auditors.
The external auditor (Ernst & Young) attends the
Company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting, and is available
to answer questions from Shareholders in relation to the
external audit.
External audit work for the Group was tendered during
2017, with Ernst & Young remaining in this role.

Principle 8: Shareholder rights
and relations
“The board should respect the rights of
shareholders and foster constructive relationships
with shareholders that encourage them to engage
with the issuer.”
Respecting the rights of Shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that its Shareholders
understand its activities by communicating effectively
with them and giving them ready access to clear and
balanced information about the Company.
To assist with this, the Company’s website is
maintained with relevant information, including copies of
presentations and reports. The Company’s key corporate
governance policies are also included on the website.

KPMG was appointed in the role of internal auditor of the
Company in December 2016 and with the establishment
of a co-source model approach to internal audit in 2020,
they currently remain the Company's co-source partner.
Their internal audit role is governed by the Internal
Audit Charter.

The Company’s major communications with
Shareholders during the financial year include its annual
and half-year reports and the Annual Shareholder
Meeting. The annual and half-year reports are available in
electronic and hard-copy format.

The primary objective of internal audit is to increase the
strength of the Company’s control environment. This is
guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the
operations of the Company. It assists the Company in
accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic
and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving
the effectiveness of its governance, risk management
and internal controls.

Communicating with Shareholders
The Company welcomes communication and feedback
from Shareholders. The Company’s investor centre (on
its website) provides a Company phone number and
email address for communications from Shareholders
and investor relations enquiries. All Shareholder
communications are responded to within a reasonable
time frame.

The scope of the internal audit programme is set by the
Audit Committee.

The Company provides options for Shareholders to
receive and send communications electronically, to and
from both the Company and its share and bond registrar.
The Company’s investor centre includes contact details
for Link Market Services, through which all Company
shares and bonds are managed.
Shareholder voting rights
Shareholders have the right to vote on major decisions as
required by the NZX Listing Rules. Further information
on Shareholder voting rights is set out in the
Company’s Constitution.
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings
are sent to Shareholders and published on the
Company’s website at least 20 working days prior to
the relevant meeting.

1 Fees for being on additional sub-committees of the Board throughout the period, including a Due Diligence Committee in relation to the issue of retail bonds in September
2020 and a sub-committee formed in relation to group strategy.
2 Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley was appointed as a Director on 1 February 2020.

The above amounts reflect the 20% pay reduction that Directors took for a period of 10 weeks in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Directors’ fees were reviewed during 2020 and an increase to the Directors' fees pool was approved by Shareholders,
in order to provide a surplus for payment of non-standard fees to Directors for assuming additional responsibilties
above and beyond the normal duties of the Board or any standard committee. Standard Directors' fees remained
unchanged. However, the appointment of a seventh Director in February 2020 increased the total amount of Directors'
fees payable.
As at 31 December 2020, the maximum aggregate amount of remuneration payable by Summerset to Directors (in
their capacity as Directors) was $840,000 per annum (2019: $750,000) and annualised standard Directors’ fees were
$768,000, inclusive of additional remuneration for committee Chairs (2019: $678,000).

As at 31 December 2020, the standard Director fees per annum are as follows:

No additional fees are paid to committee members.
Directors’ fees exclude GST, where appropriate. Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for costs directly associated
with carrying out their duties, including travel costs.
Directors and Officers also have the benefit of Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. Cover is for damages,
judgements, fines, penalties, legal costs awarded and defence costs arising from wrongful acts committed while
acting for Summerset. There are some exclusions within the policy. The insurance cover is supplemented by the
provision of Director and Officer indemnities from the Company, but this does not extend to criminal acts.

Executive remuneration
The remuneration of members of the Executive Leadership Team (Chief Executive Officer and direct reports) is
designed to promote a high-performance culture and to align Executive reward to the development and achievement
of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders.
The Board is assisted in delivering its responsibilities and objectives for Executive remuneration by the People and
Culture Committee. The role and membership of this Committee is set out in the Statement of Corporate Governance.
Summerset’s remuneration policy for members of the Executive Leadership Team provides the opportunity for
them to receive, where performance merits, a total remuneration package in the upper quartile for equivalent
market-matched roles. The People and Culture Committee reviews the annual performance appraisal outcomes for
all Executive Leadership Team members, including the Chief Executive Officer. The review takes into account external
benchmarking to ensure competitiveness with comparable market peers, along with consideration of an individual’s
performance, skills, expertise and experience.
Total remuneration is made up of three components: fixed remuneration, short-term performance-based cash
remuneration and long-term performance-based equity remuneration.
Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of base salary and benefits. Summerset’s policy is to pay fixed remuneration with
reference to the fixed pay market median.
Short-term incentives
Short-term incentives (STIs) are at-risk payments designed to motivate and reward for performance, typically in that
financial year. The target value of an STI payment is set annually, as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team
member’s fixed remuneration. For 2020, the relevant percentages were 25% to 50%.

95

Annual Report 2020

A proportion (80% for the Chief Executive Officer, 30% to 40% for other Executive Leadership Team members) of
the STI is related to achievement of annual performance metrics which aim to align executives to a shared set of key
performance indicators (KPIs) based on business priorities for the next 12 months. Target areas for the shared KPIs for
2020 are outlined below:
Target

Weighting

Underlying EBITDA

40%

Retirement unit delivery

20%

New sales development margin

10%

Resales net cash

10%

Customer satisfaction

5%

Customer clinical quality of care

5%

Health and safety

5%

Staff - HR

5%

There are three performance levels within each target area - gate-opener, on-target and maximum performance - with
100% of the amount allocated to that target area being payable when the on-target level is achieved. The maximum
performance levels allow employees to be rewarded for performance above target levels. The maximum amount of
an STI payment for an Executive Leadership Team member is 112% of the STI on-target amount for that Executive
Leadership Team member.
The balance of the STI is related to individual performance measures.
96

In the event that gate-opener underlying EBITDA performance against budget is not achieved, no STI payment will
be made.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives (LTIs) are at-risk payments through a share option plan, designed to align the reward of Executive
Leadership Team members with the enhancement of shareholder value over a multi-year period.
LTI Plan
The Executive Leadership Team members are participants of an LTI option plan. Under this plan, Executive Leadership
Team members are granted share options. These share options are exercisable in relation to shares in Summerset
Group Holdings Limited.
Option grants are made annually, with the value of each grant being set at the date of each grant and determined
as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team member’s fixed remuneration. There have now been three option
grants under this plan. For 2020, the relevant percentages were 20% to 40% (2019: 20% to 40%). Vesting of the share
options is subject to achievement of performance hurdles, which are assessed over two and three-year periods.
The performance hurdles for the option grant made in 2020 are based on:
•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget);

•

20% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group);

•

10% clinical delivery;

•

5% staff engagement;

•

5% staff turnover;

•

5% customer satisfaction - village residents;

•

5% customer satisfaction - care centre residents

The performance hurdles above were consistent with those for 2019.
Performance hurdles are set by the Board with the objective of aligning Executive reward to the development and
achievement of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders. The Board considers
that the performance hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for Shareholders.

In addition to the LTI share option plan in place for Executive Leadership Team members, Summerset also operates
an unhurdled LTI share option plan for other senior managers.
A total of 262,324 share options were granted to Executive Leadership Team members in December 2020. A total
of 1,618,274 share options have been granted to Executive Leadership Team members in the 2018, 2019 and 2020
grants. 386,528 of these share options vested as at 31 December 2020, (out of a total of 386,528 eligible to vest),
and subsequently became exercisable. The Executive Leadership Team includes the Chief Executive Officer. The
Chief Executive Officer section provides further details of share option movements under the LTI Plan for the Chief
Executive Officer.
LTI Plan prior to 2018
Prior to 2018, Executive Leadership Team members were able to purchase shares in Summerset Group Holdings
Limited under an LTI share purchase plan. The shares under this plan are held by a nominee on behalf of the Executive
Leadership Team members until such time after the vesting of shares that the nominee is directed by the Executive
Leadership Team member to transfer or sell the shares, or the shares are sold or cancelled by the nominee if vesting
criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as all other ordinary shares.
The Group has provided Executive Leadership Team members participating in the LTI share purchase plans with
interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the acquisition of the shares for these plans. These loans must be repaid
in full before shares are transferred to Executives from the nominee.
Grants under this plan were made annually, with performance measured over two and three-year periods. The value
of each grant was set at the date of the grant and determined as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team
member’s fixed remuneration, ranging from 15% to 40%. Vesting of shares is subject to achievement of performance
hurdles, which were assessed over two and three-year periods.
The performance hurdles for each grant under the LTI plan made between 2013 and 2015 are based on Summerset’s
total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the performance of relevant peers and the NZX 50.
The performance hurdles for the grants made in 2016 and 2017 were based on:
•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget);

•

25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group);

•

10% employee initiatives;

•

10% customer initiatives;

•

5% clinical strategy initiatives.

Performance hurdles were set by the Board with the objective of aligning Executive reward to the development and
achievement of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders. The Board considers
that the performance hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for Shareholders.
In addition to the LTI share purchase plan in place for Executive Leadership Team members, Summerset also operated
an unhurdled LTI share purchase plan for other senior managers.
A total of 1,169,450 shares are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited under the LTI share purchase plan on behalf
of the Executive Leadership Team as at 31 December 2020. As at 31 December 2020, 335,170 shares vested to
the Executive Leadership Team (out of a total 335,170 available to vest at this date). These shares have a first
exercise date of 25 February 2021. This is the final tranche of shares to vest under the LTI share purchase plan. The
Executive Leadership Team includes the Chief Executive Officer. The following section provides further details of
share movements under the LTI Plan for the Chief Executive Officer.
