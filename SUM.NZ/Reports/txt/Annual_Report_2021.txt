Annual Report 2021

Chair and CEO’s
report
Welcome to our annual report for the
12 months ended 31 December 2021.
This has been a year of significant
achievements for Summerset,
albeit one where the COVID–19
pandemic has continued to impact
the business.

Mark Verbiest
Chair

Scott Scoullar
Chief Executive Officer

Protecting our residents and staff
from COVID-19 has been a key
feature of the year. Despite this,
the appeal of retirement village
life, a strong housing market and
ongoing enhancements to our
product offering have continued
to see high numbers of new
residents moving into Summerset
communities, resulting in a strong
underlying profit.
Resident satisfaction rates remained
high at 96% for village residents
and 98% for care residents.
Summerset topped off the year
with an award for best provider
nationwide in the Aged Advisor
People’s Choice Awards, based on
over 2,000 in-depth reviews.
Our development pipeline has
continued to grow this year, allowing
us to offer the Summerset way
of life to more people in more places
in the future. Of particular note
is progress on our expansion into
Australia, with three new pieces
of land purchased and construction
started on our first Melbourne
retirement village.

This year’s report incorporates the
fuller picture of Summerset’s entire
business, which we began last
year, with financial and sustainability
elements once again included.
Business performance
Underlying profit for the full year is
$141.1 million, an increase of 44% on
2020. Our IFRS net profit after tax
is $543.7 million, a new record, up
136% on 2020. Operating cash flows
of $383.4 million have increased
44% from last year. The value of
our investment property is now
$4.6 billion, up 26% on 2020.
We are pleased with the overall
performance of the business for
2021. Increases in both our IFRS net
profit after tax and our underlying
profit reflect healthy growth and
sustained demand for homes in our
villages. At the same time, our low
gearing ratio shows sound control of
debt and a strong balance sheet that
highlights the advantages of
our measured approach to growth.

The Board is pleased
to declare a final
dividend of 8.6 cents
per share, payable on
23 March 2022.
Combined with our interim dividend
of 9.9 cents per share, shareholders
have received 18.5 cents per
share this year — a 30% pay-out of
underlying profit.

CHAIR AND CEO’S REPORT

Bringing Daffodil Day to residents at Avonhead during lockdown

Our COVID-19 response
We continued our proactive
response to the threat of COVID-19
this year, with $4.7 million spent
on COVID-19 related costs. This
included strict entry conditions at
our villages, no new admissions
to our care facilities or within our
villages during lockdown, separated
care staff rosters, enhanced
personal protective equipment (PPE)
for our people and no sales or
construction activities at alert level 4.
Inevitably, there have been
COVID-19 related impacts beyond
our control. Border closures
and limited availability in managed
isolation and quarantine have
affected our ability to source vital
workers such as nursing and
construction staff. The construction
industry has experienced
significant delays and supply chain
pressures, but we have managed
these risks well. It is testimony
to our teams and to our relationships
that we have been able to keep
our residents safe and deliver a
record 619 new homes on schedule.

More positively, the ongoing
COVID-19 situation has proven
a catalyst for those considering
retirement living thanks to the safety,
security, companionship and
care that come with living in one
of our villages.

We welcomed many
new residents into
our communities this
year, have high
presales for new
villages, and record
waitlist numbers.
As COVID-19 itself evolves, so does
our response. We welcomed the
government-mandated compulsory
vaccination for all village-based
roles that came into effect in
November. We followed this with
compulsory vaccination
for all Summerset roles, including
our construction teams, and
the introduction of full vaccination

requirements for all new
independent-living residents that
same month. This means we will
be selling new homes to vaccinated
people only, helping to protect our
existing residents and staff.
In late 2021, we became the first
retirement village and aged care
operator to introduce rapid antigen
testing for COVID-19. We will use
these tests, which provide a result
in 15 minutes, to assist in determining
the status of visitors and staff to help
protect residents in our care centres.
Villages and care
We continue to evolve the
Summerset way of life for our
residents. We made design changes
in our villages and care centres
to ensure that residents coming
to Summerset enjoy attractive and
modern village designs as well as
amenities that meet their needs.
This year, we continued our
investment in the care side of our
business, creating new roles. We will
invest $4.5 million into additional
frontline staff and introduce digital

innovations next year, not just to
keep our residents safer but also to
improve their experiences every day.
We continue to be concerned about
underfunding in the wider aged
care sector. Overall public funding
for care services, including daily
care rates, is insufficient to provide
the exacting standards of service
that are rightly expected. In terms
of our own services, we will not
compromise on standards.
Furthermore, we have seen the
public sector increase wages for
their nurses, with no equivalent
increase in aged care funding for the
private sector to do the same. This
year, we’ve again invested heavily
in care wages — and continue to
pay nursing rates that are equal to
the best in the sector in order to
attract and retain the qualified and
dedicated nursing staff we need.
However, given the heavily not-forprofit nature of aged care in New
Zealand, we hold fears about the
sustainability of the sector as a
whole. There are approximately
40,000 rest-home or hospital-level
care beds available to New Zealand’s

elderly, of which half are provided by
not-for-profit organisations. On top
of funding shortages, aged care has
had two years of additional cost to
keep residents safe from COVID-19.
In addition, finding nursing staff has
been an ongoing issue for the sector
this year. The increased public
sector pay rates alongside COVID-19
induced immigration delays have
created a perfect storm for nursing
shortages in aged care.
According to the New Zealand
Aged Care Association’s surveybased estimates, there are around
700 vacant positions for registered
nurses (RNs) across the aged care
industry, plus a further 50 vacant
Clinical Nurse Manager positions for
a total of around 750. The annual
turnover rate for RNs in the sector is
now 48%, up from 33% in December
2019. In the same timeframe, the
sector vacancy rate for RNs is now
13.1%, up from 7.5%.
While Summerset and some other
listed providers are able to use their
relative financial strength to invest
in care services, wage increases
and additional COVID-19 protection,

smaller and less well resourced
care providers may struggle to
keep operating.
The sector has seen numerous
instances of care centres around
New Zealand closing, pausing
admission or reducing numbers
recently as a shortage of registered
nurses has impacted their ability to
continue to deliver nursing care.

Care will continue to
be an important part
of our continuum of
care model; offering
residents access to the
various levels of service
they need at different
stages of life.

CHAIR AND CEO’S REPORT

$141.1m

Underlying profit

This year we started upgrading our
care offering to make it feel more
like home, with new decor and the
introduction of small cooking areas.
This is a commitment that we are
making to residents and that our
business will fund.
Our people provide an excellent
service — recording a remarkable
96% satisfaction rating among our
village residents and 98% among
care residents — but a review of
aged care funding is required. The
intended health reforms should be a
cue for this to happen.
Growth and development
Our design and consenting
programme is well positioned in
both New Zealand and Australia.
There have been inevitable delays
in Australia, due to lockdowns
in Melbourne, but overall we are
pleased with progress.
Five Australian sites give us the
capacity to build approximately
1,300 units, with our first
retirement village consented and
construction underway.
Consenting is also underway for
other sites as we move to create
scale and deliver growth. We have
done a great deal of research
in the market and have tailored
our offering to ensure it meets
the specific needs of Australians.
An experienced team on the
ground in Australia, with industry
knowledge and relationships will
help us take advantage of the many
opportunities the country offers.

This year, we delivered
619 units under
Occupation Right
Agreement (ORA)
and 52 care beds in
New Zealand.
This is the first time we have
reached this level of construction:
a record level of build achieved
in a year of record demand, and
a development margin within our
medium-term target range of 20%–
25%. While we anticipate continuing
challenges in the sector associated
with COVID-19 related impacts,
scarcity of product supply and
labour shortages due to the inability
to recruit some workers from
overseas, our mature procurement
practices and relationships will
lessen the impact.
We continue to hold the largest land
bank in the New Zealand retirement
village sector, allowing us to double
our current village population. In
2021 we received resource consent
for seven new villages in New
Zealand, although one (Parnell)
was subsequently appealed and is
due to be heard in 2022. In the
meantime, we also lodged a fasttrack application for the Half Moon
Bay village.
We have land for another 5,313
units in New Zealand, of which
81% is already consented. In the
medium term every unit scheduled
for development over the next four
years has resource consent, so
we are well positioned for further
growth in the New Zealand market.
We also benefit from a
geographically diverse portfolio
and a relatively high proportion
of broadacre single storey village
developments. These give us
the flexibility to adapt our
build rate depending on local
market conditions.

We have been the top listed
retirement village builder in New
Zealand for several years. This
year, our record build rate means
we are one of the top residential
builders in the country. As New
Zealand continues to grapple with
an ongoing residential housing
shortage, we are providing highquality warm homes at reasonable
prices for retirees, and we have the
capacity, the consents, and the team
to continue to do so.
Our people
This year, we continued our
investment in the care side of our
business, creating new frontline
roles. Ultimately, we can deliver as
many high-quality villages as we
do because of the diverse talents
of those who design and build
them, and the individuals and teams
who run them. We’ve continued to
extend reimbursement to our staff
for the commitment and care they
bring to work every day.
Market-leading pay is part of that,
alongside new staff initiatives such
as a diversity and inclusion strategy.
The strategy acknowledges the
value we place on the multicultural
make-up of our working population.

We’ve also invested
in core care roles
and introduced
mobile technology to
help free up our busy
frontline staff.

09

Annual Report 2021

Our work in leadership development
this year, and refreshing our health
and safety practices, are further
examples of building a culture where
people feel well directed, safe, and
valued for who they are.
Acknowledging that alert level 4
places extra stress on our frontline
staff, we paid our village and care
staff a sector-leading $3 extra per
hour during that period, reflecting
the high value we place on the work
of our employees. Our full-page ad in
the major daily newspapers was our
way of publicly recognising those
who work so selflessly to meet the
needs of our residents.

10

We are pleased to
report that over
1,300 permanent
staff received free
Summerset shares
this year as part
of our annual staff
share scheme.
We increased the value of shares
issued to each participating staff
member from $800 to $1,000
in recognition of their hard work
and dedication.
Sustainability
Last year we also committed to our
sustainability goals with a long-term
science-aligned carbon reduction
target that commits Summerset to a
62% reduction in carbon emissions
per square metre of building area by
2032 (from 2017 levels).
This year, we added a
NZ$700 million sustainability
linked loan, with financial incentives
based on meeting climate and social
targets. This loan was the first in
our sector and the largest of its
type in New Zealand at the time. To
retain a discount, we must continue

to invest in dementia care (through
our memory care apartments), lower
the carbon intensity of our villages
and improve our construction waste
diversion from landfill.
The Board retains oversight of
our climate-related risks and
opportunities, with the loan being
used to support growth in
operations and development over
the next five years. This practical
example of looking after the
environment and the community
is a signal to investors that
we will continue to explore
ways to pursue our commercial
objectives responsibly.
Looking forward
Despite the persistence of
COVID-19, the optimism we
expressed for growth in 2021 has
proven well founded. We achieved
our target build rate in New Zealand
and have started building our first
retirement village in Victoria. We
continue to add to our significant
land bank, giving us the pipeline and
the flexibility to grow in Australia
and meet ongoing demand in
New Zealand. At the same time,
strong cash recycling is keeping
our debt and our gearing at
conservative levels.

We will continue to
invest in the welfare of
our residents, through
new technology and
quality of care, and
in our staff through
competitive pay and
a culture that values
diversity and inclusion.

Subject to economic conditions, and
uncertainties around how COVID-19
will track, we look forward to
continued growth in the year ahead.
Finally, a sincere thank you, on behalf
of the Board and management,
to our investors, residents and
partners for your commitment to,
and belief in, Summerset’s goals.
And a special thank you to our
Summerset team, their families and
their support networks for another
very successful year.

Our people and
community
Our 29 retirement villages are vibrant
and diverse communities. Summerset is proud
to be home to over 6,900 residents and to
employ over 2,100 staff.
This year was a challenging
year for our residents as the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic saw
many locked down for extended
periods of time. We focused
on vaccination in 2021, with many
of our communities welcoming
on-site vaccination clinics, and with
a major focus on ensuring our staff
were protected.
Protecting our villages
The protracted presence of
COVID-19 saw many activities
shift online. There was plenty to
keep residents entertained, with
guest speakers on Zoom and livestreaming of music and quizzes
for those in our villages and the
wider community as well. We
appreciated the Student Volunteer
Army stepping in to help with
grocery and shopping support, just
as they did last year.
COVID-19 also generated a lot of
interest from those keen to find out
more about everything Summerset
offers. For families looking at
care options, we introduced our
webinars: the ‘Navigating Care’
series, explaining how we can
help; and our ‘Moving Made Easy’
series, explaining how we can

make the transition to a Summerset
village easier.
Naturally, infection prevention
and control remained a priority.
We continued with many of
the hygiene and safety measures
introduced last year, including good
physical distancing practices, use
of extensive personal protective
equipment (PPE) and cohorting of
our teams to minimise any chance
of cross-contamination.
We again made good use of iPads in
our care centres, allowing residents
to maintain connection with their
families without exposing them to
undue risk.
We also postponed sales
appointments and delayed moveins at our villages to retain a
‘bubble’ status.
By year end, over 96% of our village
population and 95% of our care
residents had received two doses
of the Pfizer vaccine. All of our staff
have received at least two doses of
the vaccine.
Our frontline staff were inspiring,
caring for people in these
challenging times, keeping them
informed and helping them stay
positive. The deep appreciation that

our residents have for our teams was
once again reflected in our annual
satisfaction survey results, with 96%
of those living independently and
98% of our care centre residents
recording how satisfied they were
with Summerset. Throughout the
year we put a huge emphasis on
encouraging our frontline staff to
be vaccinated, putting us in a
good position in October when the
government mandated vaccination
for healthcare workers.
Enhancing our services and
our care
Despite COVID-19, we continued to
introduce and roll out new measures
and initiatives to improve the lives
of our residents and to ensure that
those who are more vulnerable
receive excellent care.
In Kenepuru (Wellington), we have
been trialling a digital services
platform for our independent-living
residents. Households have
been supplied a dedicated
17-inch screen or iPad to try out the
online entertainment
and information channel.

Our memory care centres are a
specialist feature of our villages and
are tailored for those needing secure
dementia care. This year we were
delighted to be finalists for a national
award for the design of our memory
care centres at the NZ Aged Care
Association Awards.
We appointed a specialist nurse
practitioner based in Christchurch
to support our memory care
teams nationally and to offer them
knowledge and expertise in the
growing field of dementia care.
In our care centres, we will be
introducing a new ‘household’
model in 2023, with upgraded
care rooms and changes to the
layout to encourage small groups
of residents to enjoy more of one
another's company. The upgrades
will be accompanied by a change in
staffing, with small teams dedicated
to each household of no more than
18 residents.
Seeing the same familiar staff each
day will help to form the bonds
between residents and staff that
enrich both their lives.

That said, finding nursing staff has
been an ongoing issue for the sector
this year. Increases to public sector
nursing wages and immigration
delays induced by COVID-19 have
created a perfect storm for nursing
shortages in aged care.
The New Zealand Aged
Care Association’s survey-based
estimates indicate there are around
700 vacant positions for registered
nurses (RNs) across the aged care
industry. The RN turnover rate in the
sector has also increased, now at
48%, up from 33% in December 2019.
Summerset increased nurses' pay
rates to keep up with the public
sector again in 2021 in order to
attract and retain the vital nursing
staff we need to care for our
elderly residents.
We also continue to be concerned
about underfunding in the aged care
sector. Overall public funding for
care services, including daily care
rates, is insufficient to provide the
exacting standards of service that
are rightly expected, and we will not
compromise on those standards.

In November we started a
modernisation programme for our
older care centres, beginning with
the 20-year-old care centre in
Havelock North. The multi-million
dollar upgrade will include new ‘care
suites’ with individual ensuites and
more open-plan communal resident
lounges and dining rooms.
We also rolled out our
accredited falls-prevention exercise
programme to more villages
this year and brought the
classes online for residents under
COVID-19 restrictions.
Elevating our clinical care
Important improvements are also
taking place in our clinical care
with the introduction of medication
optimisation in our Auckland
villages. Many of our residents
have been prescribed a range
of medications for multiple health
conditions. Sometimes, though,
people are on medications they
no longer need or that are no
longer the best option for them.
To address that, we’ve introduced
a new advanced pharmacist role
to work with other experts and

OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

Summerset is delighted to be playing its part
in supporting the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra

our prescriber network to optimise
medications for better quality of
life. By removing and/or changing
the medication residents take, we
can do our best to ensure better
outcomes for them.
Benchmarking is another key aspect
of best practice clinical care, and
we continue to lead the sector in
this regard. Reducing the likelihood
and effects of adverse events —
such as falls and medication errors
— depends on sharing generalised
information. It is pleasing to see
most of the major participants in the
sector now sharing their data so that
we can all learn and improve.
Technology is an increasingly
important part of the way our
teams work. This year, we’ve been
looking at shifting away from manual
processes to using technology more
effectively in everyday care. In
Nelson, we’ve been trialling staff
access to our resident management
system, VCare, via a mobile app
to allow them to do their jobs
more effectively. We’ve also begun
piloting PainChek, a new app to
help recognise pain in residents who

struggle to verbalise it. The app uses
facial recognition technology and is
assisting our staff to respond more
quickly to residents.
Over the last 12 months we have
been progressively moving our
food services in-house. We expect
this to be completed at all of
our retirement villages in New
Zealand by March 2022. Our goal
is to increase our consistency
of service and to develop clear
service standards. No job losses
are expected, as current staff will
become Summerset employees
and receive our market-leading
staff benefits.
Lifting our profile
A noticeable increase in
competitiveness this year reflects
the strong growth mode that
the whole sector is experiencing.
In August we kicked off a new
marketing campaign to highlight
Summerset’s brand of active, vibrant
life across a range of media. The
campaign celebrates our belief
that age is just a number. It’s
been pleasing to see our brand
go from strength to strength

in such an environment, with
research indicating Summerset is
now the market leader nationally for
consideration and a close second for
awareness in the market.
Our marketing activities are
designed to reach older
New Zealanders in their
communities and to reinforce
the support we offer locally.
In early 2022 we signed a new
agreement to support the
New Zealand Symphony Orchestra
as a principal sponsor. We are
delighted to be partnering with
one of New Zealand’s cultural
icons, whose music gives so
much joy to communities around
the country. We continue to
support Dementia New Zealand
and this year we renewed our
sponsorship of Bowls New Zealand
for another three years. We were
pleased to support Wellington Free
Ambulance’s campaign for a new
ambulance with a $40,000 donation
after their annual street appeal was
disrupted by lockdown.

We also supported community

Our villages are
currently working with
150 local community
clubs, including bowls,
golf, croquet, bridge
and tennis groups. We
also work with Rotary,
Age Concern, the RSA,
Working Men’s Clubs
and Lions.
Engaging our people
Our people are an integral part of
everything that Summerset offers
and we are immensely proud of
them and the work they do. The
extended challenges of COVID-19
during 2021, particularly in Auckland,
saw our overall staff engagement
score decrease in the second half of
the year from 7.9 to 7.7 out of 10.
The drop in our engagement score
of 0.2 was the same as the drop in
both the New Zealand and global
health sector benchmarks advised
by our survey provider. These
decreases resulted from increases
in workload and decreases in career
path growth and reward drivers
during this period.
The move in early 2021 from
the traditional annual survey to
a continuous listening approach
involving smaller groups, more
regular feedback, and deeper
engagement has been a positive
one. We are very aware of the
stresses that COVID-19 has placed
on our teams, particularly with the
long, hard alert levels 3 and 4 in
some regions during the year, and

OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

the new survey approach provides
regular interactions with staff and
the ability to better monitor and
support mental health and wellbeing
within our organisation.
In 2020 we started a leadership
development programme for clinical
leaders. We continued to roll out that
programme this year, broadening it
to include operational management
in our villages. We’ve also introduced
similar tailored programmes for our
construction and corporate leaders.
Attracting those with the
right skills
Border closures and immigration
restrictions have generated new
ways of undertaking recruitment
and induction. We’ve significantly
upgraded our employee onboarding
programmes and rolled these out
successfully to new employees.
That’s meant more of our staff,
including nurses and caregivers,
are able to be onboarded remotely
during periods of lockdown,
and can attend training that is
delivered digitally.
Our recruitment activities show
no signs of slowing down. We
are now thinking two years ahead
when it comes to recruiting nurses
and construction leaders for our
construction programme
and operations.

Recruitment will
continue to be a priority
going forward as
we build capacity
and grow.
In such a competitive recruitment
environment, remuneration is a key
issue. To ensure we retained marketleading pay rates, we reviewed our
nurses’ pay rates based on

the Ministry of Health’s initial
settlement offer with the district
health boards (DHBs). We added
50¢ an hour to the DHB’s proposed
rates and continue to pay our nurses
rates that are equal to the best in
the sector.
Building safety into
everything we do
We remain committed to creating
safe work environments for our
people and ensuring that we are
leaders in health and safety. We have
a three-year strategy underway that,
this year, has focused on the areas of
greatest risk within our construction
and operations teams.
Within Construction, we have
extensive leadership safety training,
covering project management and
trade-specific competencies.
It is paramount our sites are safe,
and to this end we continue to use
SiteWise pre-qualification as well as
quarterly external Site Safe audits
to check our performance against
best practice. Both Operations and
Construction have robust site-based
processes and internal audits. All
these measures are in addition to the
extensive processes and practices
we use to manage the health and
safety of our residents and staff at
our villages because of COVID-19.
Expanding our commitment to
diversity and inclusion
Diversity and inclusion is something
our staff are passionate about.
This year we launched a three-year
plan to progress this important
aspect of our culture. Research
with our staff has provided
important insights on how we
can best accommodate the needs
and expectations of our diverse
multicultural workforce. Over the
medium term, we will look to build
our capabilities through a series of
programmes and initiatives.

2021 Applause Awards
Every year, our staff
nominate colleagues across 23
categories for our Applause
Awards. This year, we
received a record 1,200-plus
nominations. We brought
together all our finalists and
winners and their managers
at a gala event in Wellington
in July. The event was livestreamed on Facebook around
the world to the families of our
many international staff.

OUR VILLAGES

COVID-19 has had a significant
and accelerating effect on sales
in our villages over the last
year. Lockdowns and heightened
alert levels have highlighted the
positives of being part of a safe
and welcoming village community,
where residents can benefit from
our continuum of care model and
the opportunities to build new
friendships and pursue a range
of activities.
This impetus in interest and sales
drove a record level of trading that
has carried through to our
full-year result.
Record levels of interest
We had record levels of interest
in our developing villages.
The initial stage of villas at our
first Northland retirement village in
Whangārei sold within three months
of going to market. Our Avonhead
main building, which opened in
September, is also selling well, with
our Sales team seeing ongoing
strong interest.

To further encourage
those who are looking
to downsize to
consider one of our
villages, we recently
introduced a moving
consultancy to help
with shifting into
a village.
We now have four moving
consultants across our three busiest
markets — Hamilton, Auckland and
Christchurch — available to help
those interested in moving into one
of our villages. We are the only
retirement village provider offering
this service. It’s another example of
how we continue to innovate our
customer service to help people
make what can be challenging
choices about their retirement years.

Families are
increasingly involved in
these decisions, with
more and more of
our enquiries coming
from extended family
looking to secure a
home for their
loved ones.

A significant milestone in our
building programme
We have invested around
$320 million into our build
programme this year. Year-on-year
increases mean we remain the
largest constructor in the New
Zealand retirement village sector.
To this end, we successfully
completed our annual New Zealand
building target of 550-600 units
under Occupation Right Agreement.
That impetus and consistency
ensures we are well positioned
to meet ongoing increases in
sector demand.

Building on this interest, our Sales
team made thousands of calls
during the Auckland lockdown to
those who have expressed an
interest in moving into a Summerset
village. These calls, which are part
of our ongoing relationship building,
have been very well received
and confirm a significant wave
of interest.

Our teams were simultaneously
building on 16 sites this year,
including completing main buildings
at our Richmond and Avonhead
villages. These new buildings
incorporate our newest generation
of care suites, with individual small
kitchen spaces and more homely,
welcoming decor. The buildings also

feature memory care centres on the
ground floor, offering secure care for
those living with dementia.
Our show homes in Whangārei
opened this year and the first
residents will move in early in 2022.
Work on our St Johns village
in Auckland has progressed
well, with bulk earthworks and
civil infrastructure done and the
basement structure 70% completed.
Work on the first three apartment
buildings will start early in 2022 and
we are on track for first deliveries
in 2024.

Although the
construction industry
has reported that more
than half of major
construction projects
have been delayed, we
have been able to meet
our delivery targets.
All our villages under construction
met their year-end delivery targets,
and several new sites were
mobilised. There are a number
of reasons for this, including
robust procurement, planning
and consenting processes, and
designing most of the villages inhouse. We also have long-standing
and reliable supply agreements that
have enabled us to secure materials
well in advance.

Annual Report 2021

Construction highlights
Lightweight construction
This year we approved a lightweight
construction methodology for our
Whangārei main building. This is
particularly exciting as the building
will be more environmentally friendly,
with a reduction in embodied
carbon within the building materials.
Construction starts in 2022.

National design team

30

At Avonhead this year, we delivered
our largest main building to date
through in-house full procurement
sourcing and management of
furniture, fittings and equipment.
This reduced costs and enabled us
to make the most of opportunities to
update the design.
The largest land bank in the sector
This year has seen much of our
large forward development pipeline
enabled through the receipt of
resource consents for villages at
Prebbleton, Rangiora, Blenheim,
Cambridge, Waikanae and Milldale.
This deliberate readiness gives
us flexibility.

Product quality remains a priority for
us. This year, we combined our two
in-house design teams into one national
team responsible for the design of
all New Zealand projects. Recently
we completed a contemporary design
refresh of village architecture and look
forward to this new aesthetic being
rolled out for the first time at Milldale
in Auckland.

At Waikanae, we were able to
consent the project using the
COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track
Consenting) Act 2020, which is
targeted at shovel-ready projects
and intended to accelerate
employment. The new Act has strict
statutory consenting periods and
limited appeal rights, and so gives
greater certainty around the timing
for decisions. We have also applied
to use the fast-track process for our
Half Moon Bay retirement village in
east Auckland.

We reach new heights

The existing depth of our New
Zealand land bank enables a
measured, considered acquisition
programme. This year we acquired
a new site in the suburb of Kelvin
Grove in Palmerston North, just 6km
from the city centre.

This year we purchased a self-erecting
crawler crane, the first of its kind in
New Zealand. The new crane is from
Switzerland and is ideally suited to
metropolitan builds. We plan to use the
new crane at our Boulcott site in Lower
Hutt and we expect to see a noticeable
productivity gain. From there, we will
deploy it to work on our new lightweight
construction projects.

We will be starting construction
of two new villages next
year: Milldale (Auckland), and
Blenheim (Marlborough).

OUR VILLAGES

Our plans in Australia are
well advanced
Our Australian business continues
to progress with a team on the
ground. We are excited to introduce
older Australians to our high-quality
integrated model of village living,
which includes a full range of
retirement units, from independentliving villas, townhouses and
apartments to serviced apartments,
care and memory care beds.

Australia’s rapidly
growing elderly
population is forecast
to see those aged
75-plus increase by
140% to 4.1 million in
the next 30 years.
This year we acquired three
additional sites, meaning we now
have land at Cranbourne North,
Chirnside Park, Torquay, Craigieburn
and Oakleigh South, all in Victoria.

We secured the planning permit
for Cranbourne North in August for
the construction of 145 villas and
townhouses, 72 aged care units,
50 serviced apartments and
a one hectare public reserve.
Construction has now commenced.
Acquiring five sites in just over
two years, with planning permits
in place or being prepared, speaks
to our commitment to Australia
and the strong momentum we
have achieved in a short time. The
Australian team has grown from two
to 12 this year, as we gear up to
tailor the essence of the Summerset
offering for the Australian market.
While the New Zealand and
Australian markets have many
similarities, there are also important
differences. As our Victorian sites are
climatically different, the footprint of
our villas in Australia is larger and
there is more emphasis on outdoor
living. Our integrated offering of
independent living and care is also
relatively new in the market, with
aged care often being a standalone offering.

We have confidence that there is
enormous potential here to roll out
an offering that brings to life the spirit
of Summerset living.
Each village will be tailored to
its location, with our Torquay
site adopting a coastal feel and
Chirnside Park taking its lifestyle
cues from the nearby Yarra Valley.
We will continue to acquire more
sites as part of our expansion plans.

Our commitment
to sustainability
Summerset was the first New Zealand
retirement village operator to set
a science-aligned carbon reduction target.
It’s a commitment that sits well with
our business and with our residents.
We have been measuring,
managing, and reporting on our
carbon footprint since 2017
(our base year). In fact, we were the
first carbonzero™ retirement village
operator in New Zealand. Toitū
Envirocare began independently
auditing our emissions to the
ISO14064-1 standard in 2018,
and we have been increasing
our commitment to sustainability
ever since.
This year, our decisions around
sustainability have largely been
driven by the size and scope of
our construction business. We saw
opportunities to reduce our carbon
emissions and future-proof our
villages against climate-related risks
by adopting modern technologies,
using more responsible building
materials where feasible, and
creating landscapes that are more
water efficient.
Today, we have three sustainability
targets, all of which are linked.
Together, our short, medium
and long-term targets provide
a systematic way for us to
approach sustainability.

Good gains against our
short-term targets
Our short-term target has been
in place since 2018 and will run
through to 2022. This Toitū-verified
carbonzero target aims to reduce
our emissions intensity by 5% from
our 2017 base year. This target
is intensity-based and focuses on
the key areas of energy, waste
to landfill, paper use, fertiliser and
travel. Our use of intensity-based
targets reflects the challenge of
looking to lower our emissions as we
continue to grow.
To measure this, we use two
key measures of efficiency: total
emissions per $million of revenue,
and total emissions per square
metre. So far, our emissions intensity
overall continues to drop and we
are making good progress against
both measures.
Our internal tracking, including
mandatory and voluntary emissions
from residents, shows we have
reduced our carbon emissions
intensity per $million of revenue
by 35% and our total gross carbon
emissions per square metre of build
by 22% since 2017.

22%

Reduction in carbon
emissions per square
metre since 2017
Alongside actively working to
reduce our emissions, we offset the
emissions we can’t avoid through
purchasing carbon credits. This
year we chose to invest in Spray
Point Station, a native forest in the
Marlborough high country in New
Zealand, as well as in international
climate-related projects.
Choosing to invest in a New
Zealand native forest has allowed
us to contribute to a project
with broad environmental and
conservation benefits. The project
offers long-term carbon storage
in permanent forests. Landowners
agree to permanently retire the land
and allow it to regenerate to native
forest. In return, they are able to
sell carbon credits from the verified
carbon sink.
At our villages, our residents are very
much behind what we are looking to
do environmentally.

We introduced a powerful
medium-term target
This year we set medium-term
(2026) performance targets based
on a Sustainability Linked Lending
facility. We were the first retirement
village operator in New Zealand
to link sustainability to our
funding arrangements.

60

The goals for these targets
cover significant parts of our
business. Linking deliverables
around dementia care with
emissions intensity requires us to
take a whole-of-business approach
to achieving these targets.
The reward for doing so is ongoing
access to reduced lending rates.
Our construction waste
commitment requires us to think
about the whole building process,
from procurement through to onsite, and for us to be more efficient

requires greater collaboration with
our supply chain.

2021 key focus areas

We are pleased with our progress
to date. The amount of construction
waste being diverted from landfill
continues to increase as we
implement site waste management
plans and look to minimise the
amount of waste being generated.

Energy 80%
Travel 8%

Our long-term goals
In late 2020, we introduced a
long-term science-aligned target
that supports our involvement
in the Climate Leaders Coalition,
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP),
Toitū and now our Sustainability
Linked Lending arrangements. This
target means we have committed
to reducing our emissions intensity
by 62% per square metre by 2032,
from our 2017 base year level. This
requires a year-on-year reduction in
our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.
Energy use currently accounts for
80% of our carbon emissions, so
to achieve this target we recognise
that we will need to move to more
renewable energy sources. We have
made our first steps in this regard,
with the approval of a biomass boiler
using wood pellets as a fuel source.
This will be the alternative to gas for
water heating, cooking and laundry
at our new St Johns retirement
village in Auckland. The pellet boiler
provides a 93% emissions reduction
when compared to a gas boiler
and uses a by-product from the
timber industry that would otherwise
become waste.
We are introducing solar energy for
the first time to power our club
house buildings at our Nelson village.
This is our first step in understanding

can integrate solar into both existing

new villages. We are also looking
at how we can introduce solar for
individual villas in our villages.

Other initiatives this year
Our sustainability governance
structure has created a culture
of sustainability across the
organisation. Our long-term goals
offer a broader context within which
to further develop our governance,
report results and implement our
plans. We have also met expected
supply chain standards nationally
and internationally and compared
our efforts with what others are
doing globally.
As previously mentioned, we have
introduced a new lightweight
construction approach which
dramatically reduces the embodied
carbon within our buildings. This
approach sees a shift from
concrete to panelised mass timber
floors and structures. These are
manufactured off-site and then
brought to site ready to install.
This approach produces less
waste, is cost effective, is more
accurate, is safer to install, and will
increase on-site productivity. The
transition to lightweight structures
will ensure we are positioned for the
anticipated regulatory and building
code updates.

We have been a member of the
Climate Leaders Coalition since
its inception. Early in 2021, we
increased our commitment by
signing up to the 2019 Statement;
one of only 31 members to do so.
Signatories to the 2019 Statement
agree to reduce emissions in their
value chains through initiatives
ranging from energy efficiency
and energy procurement to waste,
partnerships and target setting.
After conducting a high-level
assessment of our key supply chains
across a number of risk areas,
we introduced anti-modern slavery
measures this year.
We also issued a new supplier
code of conduct that sets out the
standards we require for companies
we engage with.
Increasingly, investors are looking
for Summerset to disclose more
about what we are doing in
relation to environmental, social
and governance (ESG) activities. In
recent years, we have done well with
our third party ESG ratings, reflecting
the investment we have made in
this area.

The Carbon Disclosure Project
(CDP) is an international nonprofit organisation that helps
companies and cities disclose their
environmental impact. Last year,
we submitted a non-scored survey
for the first time. This year, we
chose to take part in the scored
survey. We were very pleased to
achieve a B scoring. Health care
organisations around the world
scored a C on average. Our CDP
Supplier Engagement Rating also
scored high with an A-.

First Homestar main building
at St Johns
Our St Johns village in Auckland’s
eastern suburbs is one of our largest
builds to date. It will feature a 6-star
Homestar rated main building, one of
the first large retirement villages to
be rated to this level. The village will
include an on-site vegetable garden
and irrigation across a 3-hectare site.
The main building includes apartments,
care and memory care units, and a
two-level carpark. An environmentally
friendly wood pellet boiler will be used
to heat the building when it opens
in 2026.

Donating a house to
the community
A house on our Prebbleton site in
Canterbury was scheduled to be
demolished. Instead, we organised
for the structure to be uplifted and
transferred to a church group.
This resulting in no demolition
costs, no waste sent to landfill and a
wonderful opportunity to forge links
within the surrounding community.

Across our short-term target key focus areas

Summerset is proud to be

we achieved the following:

ENERGY
Electricity and gas use has reduced by 17% per square metre

DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION

since our 2017 base year — we continued to fine-tune, maintain
and upgrade our equipment to ensure energy efficiencies.
Key initiatives included the use of building management
systems, improvements to insulation and LED lighting upgrades.
WASTE
Total waste volumes decreased overall when compared to the
previous year. However, a change in the carbon factor applied
to waste to landfill (per tonne) has resulted in an increase in
waste emissions this year. Our construction waste volumes to
landfill dropped by 21%, offset by a 18% increase in village waste
volumes. A highlight was the St Johns construction site,
which achieved a landfill avoidance rate of over 75%.
Operating facilities now also produce 53% less emissions from
waste to landfill per resident than we did in our 2017 base year.
42

TRAVEL
Travel stayed down — COVID-19 continued to affect the amount
of travel we undertake and we have made much use of Zoom for
remote meetings. Domestic, short-haul and international flights
were down 2% in 2021 compared with 2020. Overall, travel
emissions have decreased by 22% since our 2017 base year.
PAPER
Paper consumption reduced — we continued to encourage
people to do more things online. We now send invoices
by email to 58% of residents, up from 51% at the end of 2020,
and we also introduced a low-carbon paper during the year
for use across the company.
FERTILISERS
More responsible landscaping — we continue to reduce
our fertiliser emissions by choosing products that have a
low-carbon footprint. We’re also increasing our plantings

OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY

At our villages, our residents are very much
behind what we do environmentally.
Many of them are keen recyclers, cyclists and
gardeners, with an inspiring commitment to doing
their bit for the planet.

Our
performance
Summerset has maintained strong profitability
and balance sheet resilience throughout
2021 and is well positioned for future
sustained growth.
Financial performance overview
Underlying profit for the year
ended 31 December 2021 increased
by 44% on the prior year to
$141.1 million (2020: $98.3 million),
driven principally by increased sales
of new and existing units.
This reflects the growing demand
for the Summerset lifestyle, and in
response we increased our delivery
of units for sale to 619 (2020: 356).
Sale volumes of new units have
increased by 34% and the robust
residential property market is also
contributing to strong
sale prices. Realised gains
on investment property are
$138.4 million (2020: $94.3 million).
Revenue for the year grew 19% to
$205.3 million (2020: $172.4 million),
reflecting the opening of two
main buildings, village revenue
growth from deliveries within our
developing villages and continued
high rates of care occupancy in
existing villages.
Profits from operations have
reduced due to wages and costs
increasing at a rate higher than
the increases to DHB funding, in
particular nurses’ wages, council
rates, insurance, and power. We
have also had ongoing costs relating

to COVID-19, and the additional
costs associated with opening two
new care centres.
Underlying profit is a non-GAAP
measure. A detailed explanation is
included in Note 2 to the Financial
Statements (see page 59). In
general terms, underlying profit
removes the fair value movement of
investment property and reinstates
the realised gains associated with
our resales and the development
margin associated with our new
sales. Underlying profit is used to
determine the dividend pay-out
to shareholders.
COVID-19 impact
Sales significantly reduced during
the two-week national level 4
lockdown in August/September, but
returned to pre-lockdown numbers
by mid-September. We continued
to sell and settle units in levels 3
and 2, with safeguards in place to
ensure we protect our residents.
As we have only two villages with
new units delivering in Auckland, the
longer lockdown in levels 4 and 3 in
this area did not have a significant
impact on overall sales.
We incurred $4.7 million of one-off
operational costs due to COVID-19 in

2021. This was predominantly from
additional staff wages, pandemic kits
and personal protective equipment.
Village and care staff were paid
an additional $3 per hour during
level 4 lockdown, stand-down leave
was given as a precaution for staff
either because of their health or
that of their close contacts, and
we introduced security at our sites
during level 4. These costs are some
of the direct costs related to our
response, but we also incurred a
number of indirect costs. These
include the cost of paying the
construction staff during lockdown
while they were unable to be onsite, and investment in marketing
and sales post-lockdown to support
our sales teams to ensure our sales
were successful. We will continue
to plan and prepare to ensure we
are well positioned to deal with any
future outbreaks and adapt to living
with COVID-19.
Long-term growth
A key component of underlying
profit is the realised development
margin on new sales, which
was $78.5 million in 2021
(2020: $48.2 million). The increase
was due to the net effect of an

45

Annual Report 2021

overall increase in the number of
new settlements and improvements
in apartment margins following price
growth in the Auckland market,
offset against construction cost
inflation and programme delays
caused by COVID-19 supply
chain disruption and the
lockdowns imposed by the
New Zealand government.

will continue to be an area of focus
for the Board and management.

Good margins reflect the
advantage of having strong
in-house capabilities for each
stage of village development
including land acquisition, planning,
consenting, design, procurement
and construction management.
We continue to work to manage
cost inflation across our build
pipeline through leveraging from
scale, standardisation and mature
procurement planning. This is
particularly important given the
construction industry is at a critical
point of supply and demand,
with supply constrained by the
ongoing impacts of COVID-19, and
strong demand with residential
and commercial consenting at
record levels.

Summerset continues
to maintain the
largest land bank for
a retirement village
operator in New
Zealand and acquired
four new sites in
New Zealand and
Australia in 2021.

OUR PERFORMANCE

These are Kelvin Grove (Palmerston
North), Chirnside Park (Melbourne),
Oakleigh South (Melbourne) and
Craigieburn (Melbourne). This brings
our total land bank to 6,614 units.
Summary of sales
and developments
Summerset had a record sales year,
with 978 unit sales of Occupation
Rights (2020: 785), 540 of them
new unit sales and 438 resales.
Average gross proceeds per new
sale settlement of $630,000 were
up from $607,000 in 2020 due
to the price increases from the
strong housing market partially
offset by a different mix of unit types
and regions. Realised resale gain
increased by 30% to $59.9 million
in 2021. Average gross proceeds per
resale settlement were $528,000, up
14% from 2020.
Key development milestones
included the beginning of
construction of three new villages,
Prebbleton (Canterbury), Waikanae
(Kāpiti) and Cambridge (Waikato),
and completion of two new
village centres, Richmond (Tasman)
and Avonhead (Christchurch). For
developing villages still under
construction, new unit sales were
particularly strong at Rototuna
(Hamilton), Ellerslie (Auckland),
Richmond (Tasman), Te Awa
(Napier), Kenepuru (Wellington),
and Casebrook and Avonhead
(Christchurch). We had our
strongest year of presales ever
in 2021, with 72% of all villa
deliveries pre-sold.
In Australia we have continued
to acquire land and work on the
consenting of sites, and have begun
earthworks for our first village,
at Cranbourne North (Melbourne).
We expect the first deliveries in
early 2023.

Net profit after tax
Summerset recorded a net profit
after tax of $543.7 million for the
year ended 31 December 2021, up
from $230.8 million in 2020. This
increase is largely due to the price
increases from the strong housing
market partially offset by a different
mix of unit types and regions.
Fair value movement in 2021 of
$537.5 million reflects the delivery of
545 retirement units in the financial
year, the completion of two main
buildings and an uplift in land bank
values and unit pricing reflecting the
residential house price increases in
the last twelve months.
Business growth and expenses
Summerset derives its revenue from
selling units (deferred management
fees) and providing village and
care services. The company’s
revenue increased as a result
of higher volumes, reflective
of the continuing growth and
scale of our operations. Deferred
management fees on Summerset’s
units sold under Occupation Right
Agreement were $75.2 million in
2021 (2020: $60.8 million). The
growth reflects the increase in the
number, occupancy and value of
Summerset’s portfolio of units.
At 31 December 2021, Summerset’s
total unit portfolio reached 6,028
(2020: 5,357) and at year end
there were only 262 new units
and 80 resale units available for
sale. Occupancy in our mature
care centres was 97% (2020: 96%),
which is above the industry average
of 90%.
Total expenses increased in 2021
by 20% to $190.6 million (2020:
$158.3 million), largely due to the
initial costs of new care centres
opening in line with Summerset's
ongoing business growth, and
increased care wage costs at a
rate above the level of funding
increases from DHBs. We have
also had increased uncontrollable
expenditure items such as rates

and power, and spent more on
additional sales and marketing for
future developments.
Net cash from operating activities
Summerset’s net cash from
operating activities was
$383.4 million for the year, up 44%
from 2020 (2020: $266.8 million).
This was principally driven by gross
receipts from new Occupation
Right Agreement sales, amounting
to $337.6 million, up from
$237.0 million in 2020.
Summerset is a growth company
and reinvests operating cash flows
back into the business to finance
future growth. In 2021 Summerset
invested $425.0 million, primarily
in new and existing retirement
villages and care centres (2020:
$318.8 million).
Investment activities are principally
the purchase of land and the
development and refurbishment of
new and existing retirement villages
and care centres.
Assets rose to $4.9 billion
Total assets rose 26% to $4.9 billion
at 31 December 2021 (2020:
$3.9 billion), mainly due to growth
in the size and value of Summerset’s
investment property, which reached
$4.6 billion (2020: $3.6 billion).
At balance date, Summerset also
had property, plant and equipment
valued at $277.7 million (2020:
$181.1 million), most of this
being care centres (these are
operated to provide services and
are therefore not included as
investment property). An increased
embedded value of $1.4 billion
(2020: $883.6 million) demonstrates
future cash that can be generated
when units are resold.
Interest-bearing debt of
$747.0 million was 15% of
total assets at year end
(2020: $687.1 million). Summerset
refinanced approximately
$700.0 million of syndicated bank

47

Annual Report 2021

debt in August 2021, which included
$315.0 million of existing debt due to
mature on 31 March 2022. This has
a mix of four and five-year tenures
and brings total lending facilities to
approximately $1.5 billion. Most of
the growth in bank debt facilities is
in Australia to fund the development
of our land bank in Victoria.

The year-end debt at face value
is made up of $374.9 million of
bank borrowings and $375.0 million
of retail bonds. Summerset also
has residents' loans of $1.8 billion
(2020: $1.5 billion). This is in
the form of licences paid by
residents under Occupation Right
Agreements. These are repayable
when residents vacate units and
the associated Occupation Rights
are resold.

2021 dividends
Summerset will pay a final dividend
of 8.6 cents per share (cps) on
23 March 2022, making a full
pay-out for the 2021 year of
18.5 cps (2020: 13.0 cps). Board
policy remains for shareholder
distributions in the range of 30–50%
of each year’s underlying profit. The
2021 distribution of $42.5 million
represents 30% of underlying profit
($141.1 million), which is consistent
with the last six years. Summerset
continues to offer shareholders
a dividend reinvestment option,
including a 2% discount to market
share price.

Accounting policies
Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and that are relevant to the understanding of the financial
statements are provided throughout the accompanying notes.
The accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the periods presented in these financial statements.
The Group adopted all mandatory new and amended NZ IFRS Standards and Interpretations and there has been no material impact
on the Group's financial statements.

Implementation of the April 2021 IFRIC agenda decision in relation to software-as-a-service arrangements
During the period, the Group reviewed its accounting policy in relation to upfront configuration and customisation costs incurred
in implementing software-as-a-service arrangements in response to the IFRIC agenda decision clarifying its interpretation of how
current accounting standards apply to these types of arrangements. The Group has completed its evaluation of the impact of this
interpretation on its financial statements and determined this to not be material.

There are no other new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and are not yet effective, that are expected
to have a significant impact on the Group.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The principal areas of judgement in preparing these
financial statements are described in the following notes:
•

Deferred management fees – Note 4

•

Deferred taxation – Note 7

•

Interest rate swaps – Note 14

•

Leases – Note 16

•

Revenue in advance – Note 4

•

Valuation of investment property – Note 11

•

Valuation of property, plant and equipment – Note 9

•

Valuation of retail bonds – Note 17

Underlying profit

Underlying profit is a non-GAAP measure and differs from NZ IFRS profit for the period. Underlying profit does not have a standardised
meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by other entities.
The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure in addition to IFRS profit to assist readers in determining the realised
and unrealised components of fair value movement of investment property, impairment and tax expense in the Group’s income
statement. The measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures to monitor performance and make investment
decisions. Underlying profit is a measure that the Group uses consistently across reporting periods. Underlying profit is used to
determine the dividend pay-out to shareholders.
This statement presented is for the Group, prepared in accordance with the Basis of preparation: underlying profit described below.

Basis of preparation: underlying profit
Underlying profit is determined by taking profit for the period determined under NZ IFRS, adjusted for the impact of the following:
•

Less fair value movement of investment property: reversal of investment property valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS profit
for the period, which comprise both realised and non-realised valuation movements. This is reversed and replaced with realised
development margin and realised resale gains during the period, effectively removing the unrealised component of the fair value
movement of investment property.

•

Less reversal of impairment of assets / add impairment of assets: remove the impact of non-cash care centre valuation changes
recorded in NZ IFRS profit for the period. Care centres are valued annually, with fair value gains flowing through to the revaluation
reserve unless the gain offsets a previous impairment to fair value that was recorded in NZ IFRS profit. Where there is any

59

Annual Report 2021

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
impairment of a care centre, or reversal of a previous impairment that impacts NZ IFRS profit for the period, this is eliminated for
the purposes of determining underlying profit.
•

Add realised gain on resales: add the realised gains across all resales of occupation rights during the period. The realised gain
for each resale is determined to be the difference between the licence price for the previous occupation right for a unit and the
occupation right resold for that same unit during the period. Realised resale gains are a measure of the cash generated from
increases in selling prices of occupation rights to incoming residents, less cash amounts repaid to vacated residents for the
repayment of the price of their refundable occupation right purchased in an earlier period, with the recognition point being the
cash settlement. Realised resale gains exclude deferred management fees and refurbishment costs.

•

Add realised development margin: add realised development margin across all new sales of occupation rights during the period,
with the recognition point being the cash settlement. Realised development margin is the margin earned on the first time sale
of an occupation right following the development of a unit. The margin for each new sale is determined to be the licence price
for the occupation right, less the cost of developing that unit.
Components of the cost of developing units include directly attributable construction costs and a proportionate share of the
following costs:
•

Infrastructure costs

•

Land cost on the basis of the purchase price of the land

•

Interest during the build period

•

Head office costs directly related to the construction of units

All costs above include non-recoverable GST.
Development margin excludes the costs of developing common areas within the retirement village (including a share of the
proportionate costs listed above). This is because these areas are assets that support the sale of occupation rights for not just
the new sale but for all subsequent resales. It also excludes the care centre development costs which relate to assets which are
not subject to the sale of occupation rights.
Where costs are apportioned across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the
nature of the cost.
Where a unit not previously sold under occupation right agreement is converted to a unit sold under occupation right agreement,
realised development margin recognised on the new sale of these units includes the following costs:

60

•

•

Conversion costs

•

A fair value apportionment reflecting the value of the property immediately prior to conversion

Add/(less) deferred tax expense/(credit): reversal of the impact of deferred taxation.
Underlying profit does not include any adjustments for abnormal items or fair value movements on financial instruments that are
included in NZ IFRS profit for the period.

3. Segment reporting
The Group operates in one industry, being the provision of integrated retirement villages. The services provided across all of the
Group’s villages are similar, as are the type of customer and the regulatory environment. The chief operating decision makers, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors, review the operating results of the Group as a whole on a regular basis. On
this basis, the Group has one reportable segment, and the Group results are the same as the results of the reportable segment. All
resource allocation decisions across the Group are made to optimise the consolidated Group’s result.
The Group continues to proceed with its expansion into Australia with five sites purchased to date. These sites are either currently
being, or will be, developed into retirement villages. To date the expenditure incurred and assets acquired in Australia have been
immaterial to the Group and so are not reported as a separate operating segment as at 31 December 2021.
The Ministry of Health is a significant customer of the Group, as the Group derives care fee revenue in respect of eligible government
subsidised aged care residents. Fees earned from the Ministry of Health for the year ended 31 December 2021 amounted to
$34.6 million (2020: $31.5 million). No other customers individually contribute a significant proportion of the Group revenue. All
revenue is earned in New Zealand.

4. Revenue
Care fees and village services income are recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Deferred management fees, which entitle residents to accommodation and the use of the community facilities within the village,
are recognised over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue.
The expected periods of tenure, being based on historical Group averages, are estimated to be seven to eight years for villas,
five years for apartments, three years for serviced apartments and memory care apartments and two years for care suites. Where
the deferred management fees over the contractual period exceed the amortisation of the deferred management fee based on
estimated tenure, the amount is recorded as a liability (revenue in advance). At balance date, the majority of the revenue in advance
balance is non-current. Deferred management fees are recognised on a gross basis in the receipts for residents’ loans section of the
statement of cash flows.

Finance costs

Interest expense comprises interest payable on borrowings and is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are capitalised for property, plant and equipment (Note 9), and investment property (Note 11), if they are directly
attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities
to prepare the asset commence and expenditure and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.

62

Borrowing costs of $16.8 million (2020: $12.3 million) have been capitalised during the period of construction in the current year. The
weighted average capitalisation rate on funds borrowed representing the borrowing costs of the loans used to finance projects is
3.00% per annum (2020: 3.15% per annum).
Two of the Group's retail bonds are designated in a fair value hedging relationship. Details of fair value hedging are included in Note 14.

7. Income tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax, calculated using the tax rate enacted or substantively enacted at balance date and
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, except when it relates to
items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the tax expense is recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax expense is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable it will be utilised. Temporary differences for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit, unless they arise from business combination, are not provided for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

8. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Trade receivables are not significant on an individual
basis and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate, less an
allowance for doubtful debts. The allowance for doubtful debts is made up of expected credit losses based on assessment of trade
receivables debt at the individual level for impairment, plus an additional allowance on the remaining balance for potential credit
losses not yet identified. The expected credit losses allowance requirement on the remaining balance has been set at 2%.

9. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes care centres (including memory care apartments and care suites), both complete and under
development, and corporate assets held.
All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
of the asset. The cost of self-constructed care centres includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to
bring the care centres to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest
during the build period and head office costs directly related to the construction of the care centres. Where costs are apportioned
across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, completed care centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of
the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, since the assets were
last revalued. Other corporate assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if
any. Where an item of plant and equipment is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the income statement is calculated as the
difference between the net sales price and the carrying amount of the asset.
Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence, which is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged
between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction as at the valuation date.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset
previously recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement unless it directly offsets
a previous surplus in the same asset in other comprehensive income. Any accumulated depreciation at revaluation date is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal,
any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings. Independent valuations are
performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the asset’s fair value at the
balance sheet date.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line (SL) basis over the estimated useful life of each item of property,
plant and equipment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values
are reassessed at each reporting date.
Major depreciation rates are as follows:
•
•

Buildings (2% to 14% SL)
Motor vehicles (8% to 10% SL)

•
•

Furniture and fittings (7% to 20% SL)
Plant and equipment (7% to 50% SL)

Also included in the buildings category is building fit-out.
Right of use assets are depreciated on a SL basis over the term of their lease. Refer to Note 16.

Carrying amounts

Buildings include $23.9 million of care centres under development carried at cost at 31 December 2021 (2020: $16.9 million).
Right of use assets relate to the Group's leased office premises and car park spaces; refer to Note 16 for further information.

Transfer
Each period, the Group assesses the significance of ancillary services provided in its units sold under occupation right agreement.
As a result, memory care apartments and care suites have been reclassified from investment property to property, plant and
equipment effective 1 January 2021. The Group's memory care apartments and care suites were transferred to property, plant and
equipment at fair value as at transfer date which totalled $24.0 million.
During the period, the Group amalgamated land titles for five villages which were previously split between land relating to care
facilities and land relating to investment property. As the land relating to care facilities forms an insignificant portion of the total
village land, and consenting for future refurbishment requires one title, it has been transferred from property, plant and equipment to
investment property. This aligns the classification of this land to the rest of the Group's land which is all held as investment property.
The land has been transferred at its fair value at transfer date which totalled $5.3 million.

Revaluations
An independent valuation to determine the fair value of all building assets related to completed care centres was carried out as at
31 December 2021 by CBRE Limited ("CBRE NZ"), an independent registered valuer. Valuations are carried out annually.
CBRE NZ determines the fair value of care centres (excluding units under occupation right agreement) using an earnings-based
multiple approach and the amount apportioned to goodwill of $16.0 million is not recognised (2020: $18.9 million). Significant
assumptions used in the most recent valuation include market value per care bed of between $68,200 and $227,600, and individual
unit earning capitalisation rate of between 11.50% and 14.75%.

Revaluation of units under occupation right agreement held as property, plant and equipment
To assess the market value of the Group's interest in the units under occupation right agreement held as property, plant and
equipment, CBRE NZ have undertaken a cash flow analysis to derive a net present value. Significant assumptions used by CBRE NZ
include a discount rate of between 14.75% and 15.50%, and a growth rate of between 0.5% and 3.0%. Other assumptions used include
the average entry age of residents of between 81 and 90 years, and the stabilised departing occupancy periods of units of between
2.9 and 3.1 years.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
As the fair value of land and buildings is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised property, plant
and equipment as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolio of care centres (excluding units under occupation right agreement) are the capitalisation rates applied to
individual unit earnings and the market value per care bed. A significant decrease (increase) in the capitalisation rate would result in
a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the market value per care bed would
result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
of the entity’s portfolio of units under occupation right agreement, held as property, plant and equipment, are the discount
rates and growth rates. A significant decrease (increase) in the discount rate would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair
value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the growth would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value
measurement. Other key components in determining the fair value of units under occupation right held as property, plant and
equipment are the average entry age of residents and the average occupancy of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the
occupancy period of units would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease)
in the average entry age of residents would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
No comparatives have been provided in relation to units under occupation right agreement. As at 31 December 2020 there were no
such units held as property, plant and equipment.

10. Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a SL basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date
that they are available for use. The intangible assets are software and the amortisation rates at 31 December 2021 are between 10-20%
SL basis.

11. Investment property
Investment property is held to earn current and future rental income (deferred management fees). It comprises land and buildings,
and associated equipment and furnishings, relating to retirement units and common facilities in the retirement village. Investment
property includes buildings under development, excluding care centres under development which are included in property, plant
and equipment. Initial recognition of investment property is at cost and it is subsequently measured at fair value, with any change
in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The cost of retirement units includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to bring the retirement units
to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest during the build period
and head office costs directly related to the construction of the retirement units. Where costs are apportioned across more than one
asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Land acquired with the intention of constructing investment property on it is classified as investment property from the date
of acquisition.
Rental income from investment property, being deferred management fees, is accounted for as described in Note 4.
Depreciation is not charged on investment property.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.

Manager's net interest

The Group is unable to reliably determine the fair value of the non-land portion of retirement villages under development
at 31 December 2021 and therefore these are carried at cost. This equates to $322.4 million of investment property
(2020: $330.0 million).

The fair value of investment property as at 31 December 2021 was determined by independent registered valuers CBRE Limited
("CBRE NZ") and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited ("JLL") for villages including land in New Zealand and CBRE Valuations Pty Limited
("CBRE AU") for land in Australia. The fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on a semi-annual basis, based on
market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing
buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably,
prudently and without compulsion.
As required by NZ IAS 40 - Investment Property, the fair value as determined by the independent registered valuer is adjusted for
assets and liabilities already recognised on the balance sheet which are also reflected in the cash flow analysis.
To assess the fair value of the Group's interest in each New Zealand village, CBRE NZ and JLL have undertaken a cash flow analysis
to derive a net present value. The Group's development land has been valued by CBRE NZ using the direct comparison approach.
Each valuer continues to review market conditions in relation to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The valuers' view is that the longer
term economic impacts as a result of COVID-19 on the New Zealand aged care sector still remain largely unknown, however, more
recently there has been sufficient depth of transactions in most markets to provide considered valuation advice. That said, given the
remaining uncertainty and unknown impact COVID-19 may have in the future, they still advise a higher degree of caution should be
exercised when relying upon the valuation.
Significant assumptions used by CBRE NZ and JLL in relation to the New Zealand investment property include a discount rate of
between 13.5% and 16.5% (2020: 13.5% to 16.5%), and a long-term nominal house price inflation rate (growth rate) of between 0%
and 3.5% (2020: 0% to 3.5%). Other assumptions used include the average entry age of residents of between 73 and 89 years (2020:
72 years and 90 years), and the stabilised departing occupancy periods of units of between 3.5 and 8.8 years (2020: 3.7 years and
9.0 years).
Sites under development in Australia have been valued separately by CBRE AU. Land is valued under the same methodology as
development land in New Zealand with the exception of Torquay which is valued under a modified direct comparison approach
which takes into account the gross realisation of the proposed units 'as if complete'.
As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised investment
property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
To assess the market value of the Group's interest in a retirement village, CBRE and JLL have undertaken a cash flow analysis to
derive a net present value. As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are significant and unobservable,
the Group has categorised investment property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 - Fair
Value Measurement.
The sensitivities of the significant assumptions are shown in the table below:

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Other key components in determining the fair value of investment property are the average entry age of residents and the average
occupancy of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the occupancy period of units would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair
value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents would result in a significantly higher
(lower) fair value measurement.

Operating expenses
Direct operating expenses arising from investment property during the period amounted to $46.6 million (2020: $41.1 million).

Security
At 31 December 2021, all investment property relating to registered retirement villages under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are
subject to a registered first mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor to secure the Group’s obligations to the occupation right
agreement holders.

14. Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swaps are initially
recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value on each reporting date.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined based on cash flows discounted to present value using current market
interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its floating rate debt. These interest
rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. When interest rate swaps meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective
portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to reserves are transferred out of reserves and included in the
measurement of the hedged transaction when the forecast transaction occurs. When interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria
for cash flow hedge accounting, all movements in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.

Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
variable rates and to pay interest at fixed rates. At 31 December 2021, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with a
total notional principal amount of approximately $444.7 million, made up of $312.0 million denominated in NZD and $100.0 million
in AUD (2020: $337.0 million denominated in NZD). Of the swaps in place, at 31 December 2021 $339.8 million (2020: $312.0 million)
are being used to cover approximately 45% (2020: 45%) of the floating rate debt principal outstanding. These agreements effectively
change the Group’s interest exposure on the principal covered by the interest rate swaps from a floating rate to fixed rates, which
range between 0.56% and 3.87% (2020: 1.22% and 3.87%).
The fair value of these agreements at 31 December 2021 is a $3.7 million liability, comprised of $7.2 million of swap liabilities and
$3.5 million of swap assets (2020: liability of $28.2 million, comprised of $29.2 million of swap liabilities and $1.0 million of swap
assets). Of this, a liability of $881,000 is estimated to be current (2020: $274,000). The agreements cover notional amounts for terms
of up to seven years.

Fair value hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its fixed rate debt arising from the retail
bonds. The hedge is for the future fair value movements in the retail bonds as a result of market interest rate movements. The Group
has designated $225.0 million of its retail bonds in fair value hedge relationships.
Both the hedging instrument (interest rate swap) and the hedged risk are recognised at fair value. The change in the fair value of both
items offset in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent the hedging relationship is effective. The reduction in fair value
of the interest rate swaps of $16.2 million (2020: increase of $5.8 million) has been recognised in finance costs and has been offset
with a similar fair value gain on the retail bonds to leave an ineffective amount in finance costs of $3,000 (2020: $13,000).
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
fixed rates and to pay interest at floating rates. At 31 December 2021, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with
a total notional principal amount of $225.0 million (2020: $225.0 million). Of the interest rate swaps in place, at 31 December 2021
$225.0 million (2020: $225.0 million) are being used to cover 60% (2020: 60%) of the fixed interest rate retail bonds outstanding.

15. Residents’ loans

74

Residents’ loans are amounts payable under occupation right agreements. An occupation right agreement confers a right of
occupancy to a villa, apartment, serviced apartment, care suite or memory care apartment. The consideration received on the grant
of an occupation right agreement is allocated to the resident’s loan in full. These loans are non-interest bearing and are payable when
both an occupation right agreement is terminated and there has been settlement of a new occupation right agreement for the same
unit and the proceeds from the new settlement have been received by the Group. Residents’ loans are initially recognised at fair value
and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group holds a contractual right to set-off the deferred management fee receivable on termination of an agreement against the
resident’s loan to be repaid. Residents’ loans are therefore recognised net of the deferred management fee receivable on the balance
sheet. Deferred management fees are payable by residents in consideration for the supply of accommodation and the right to share
in the use of community facilities. Deferred management fees are paid in arrears, with the amount payable calculated as a percentage
of the resident’s loan amount as per the resident’s occupation right agreement. Deferred management fee receivable is calculated
and recorded based on the current tenure of the resident and the contractual right to deferred management fee earned at balance
date. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on recognition of deferred management fee revenue.

16. Leases
The leases to which NZ IFRS 16 applies are the leases of office premises and car parks occupied by the Group in New Zealand and
Australia. In respect of these leases, a right of use asset is disclosed along with a corresponding lease liability. The right of use assets
are depreciated on a SL basis, while the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not yet paid,
discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.
The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months
or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as incurred as a rental
expense over the lease term.
Right of use assets are classified as property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities are disclosed as such in the Group's statement
of financial position.
The weighted average incremental borrowing rates used to measure lease liabilities at the date of application are between 3.19% and
4.67% (2020: 3.80% and 4.67%).
When the Group has the option to extend a lease, management uses its judgement to determine whether or not an option would be
reasonably certain to be exercised. Management considers all facts and circumstances, including their past practice and any cost
that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help determine the lease term. Other assumptions and
judgements used by management include calculating the appropriate discount rate.
During the period, as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic the Group, as a lessee, received $8,000 in rent concessions (2020:
$60,000). Management has applied the COVID-19 practical expedient, issued by the IASB in May 2020, and has accounted for the
rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications. The rent concessions have instead been accounted for as a reduction to
operating expenses.

As a lessor
The Group acts as a lessor under occupation right agreements with village residents, along with a small number of residential
rental properties. The assets leased by the group as a lessor are disclosed as investment property and lease income on occupation
right agreements is generated in the form of deferred management fees. The lease term is determined to be the greater of the
expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue. The Group uses the portfolio approach to account for leases of units
to village residents and allocates individual leases to different portfolios depending on the type of unit. The Group does not have
any sub-leases.
76

17. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings include secured bank loans and unsubordinated fixed-rate retail bonds.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to
initial recognition, the borrowings are measured at amortised cost, with any difference between the initial recognised amount and the
redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest rate. Two of the three
retail bonds, SUM010 and SUM020, are designated in fair value hedge relationships, which means that any change in market interest
rates results in a change in the fair value adjustment of that debt. SUM030 is not hedged. Transaction costs incurred in arranging
financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant debt instrument.

The weighted average interest rate for the year to 31 December 2021 was 3.00% (2020: 3.15%). This includes the impact of interest
rate swaps (see Note 14).
Effective 1 October 2021, the Group refinanced two tranches of the syndicated facility that were due to expire and obtained new
NZD and AUD bank loan facilities. The secured bank loan facility at 31 December 2021 has a limit of approximately $1,110 million
(2020: $750 million). Lending of AU$120 million expires in November 2023, lending of NZ$310 million expires in November 2024,
lending of NZ$50 million and AU$130 million expires in September 2025 and lending of NZ$315 million and AU$185 million expires
in September 2026.

Annual Report 2021

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
The Group has issued three retail bonds. The first retail bond was issued for $100 million in July 2017 and has a maturity date of 11 July
2023. This retail bond is listed on the NZX Debt Market (NZDX) with the ID SUM010. The second retail bond was issued for $125 million
in September 2018 and has a maturity date of 24 September 2025. This retail bond is listed on the NZDX with the ID SUM020. The
third retail bond was issued for $150 million in September 2020 and has a maturity date of 21 September 2027. This retail bond is listed
on the NZDX with the ID SUM030.

Security
The bank loans and retail bonds rank equally with the Group’s other unsubordinated obligations and are secured by the following
securities held by a security trustee:
•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is not a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages
Act 2003;

•

a second-ranking registered mortgage over the land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages Act
2003 (behind a first-ranking registered mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor);

•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group member;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the New Zealand- incorporated guaranteeing Group members, but in respect
of which the Statutory Supervisor has first rights to the proceeds of security enforcement against all assets of the registered
retirement villages to which the security trustee is entitled;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group members; and

•

a Specific Security Deed in respect of each marketable security of Summerset Holdings (Australia) Pty Limited, held by
Summerset Holdings Limited.

18. Financial instruments
78

Exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board adopts policies for
managing each of these risks as summarised below.
The Group has seen no material change in its exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but
it will continue to monitor the situation.

Categories of financial instruments

Financial assets
All financial assets of the Group are classified at amortised cost except for interest rate swaps, which are classified as fair value
through profit and loss, and those assets that are designated in a hedge relationship.

Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities except interest rate swaps and retail bonds are classified as liabilities at amortised cost. Refer to Note 17 for detail
on the retail bonds.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a resident or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual
obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk relates to receivables from residents and bank balances. The Group manages
its exposure to credit risk. The Group’s cash is held with its principal banker; with the level of exposure to credit risk considered
minimal, with low levels of cash generally held. Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and funds are placed
with high-credit-quality financial institutions. The level of risk associated with sundry debtors is considered minimal due to the
recoverability of this balance being assessed as high. The Group does not require collateral from its debtors and the Directors
consider the Group’s exposure to any concentration of credit risk to be minimal.
There has been no instances of residents or counterparties failing to meet their contractual obligations as a direct result of COVID-19.
There has been no change to credit terms and aging of receivables remains consistent with the prior years.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The status of trade receivables is

In summary, trade receivables are determined to be impaired as follows:

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by seeking to obtain the most competitive rate of interest at all times. The Group
has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to provide an effective cash flow hedge against the variability in floating
interest rates. The Group has also entered into other interest swap agreements to reduce interest rate repricing risk in relation to retail
bonds. See Note 14 for details of interest rate swap agreements.
To comply with the Group’s risk management policy, the hedge ratio is based on the interest rate swap notional amount to hedge
the same notional amount of bank loans or retail bonds. This results in a hedge ratio of 1:1. This is the same as used for actual risk
management purposes, and such a ratio is appropriate for the purposes of hedge accounting as it does not result in an imbalance
that would create hedge ineffectiveness.
In these hedge relationships the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
•

a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship;

•

where the hedge instrument has been transacted on a date different to the rate set date of the bank loan or retail bonds, interest
rates could differ; and

•

differences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.

Other than these sources, due to the alignment of the hedged risk in the hedged item and hedged instrument, hedge ineffectiveness
is not expected to arise.
At 31 December 2021 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’s
profit by approximately $3.7 million (2020: decrease by $2.8 million) and decrease total comprehensive income by approximately
$1.8 million (2020: increase by $8.7 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity
by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk on residents’ loans and related
sundry debtors through the contractual requirements of occupation right agreements, whereby a resident’s loan is repaid only on
receipt of the loan monies from the incoming resident.

Residents’ loans are non-interest bearing and are not required to be repaid following termination of an occupation right agreement
until receipt of cash for the new resident loan from the incoming resident. The figures above have been calculated using best
estimates of resident loan repayments based on historical information. To date, cash for new residents’ loans received has always
exceeded cash to repay residents’ loans, net of deferred management fees.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of the Group's assets, liabilities and financial performance will fluctuate due to changes
in foreign currency rates.
80

The Group is primarily exposed to currency risk through its subsidiaries in Australia.
The risk to the Group is that the value of the overseas subsidiaries' financial position and financial performance will fluctuate in
economic terms and as recorded in the Group financial statements due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Due to limited activity
in the Australian subsidiaries in 2021, the Group did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange risk.

The fair value of residents’ loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Future cash flows are based on the assumption
that the average tenure periods are those disclosed in Note 4 and have been discounted at 14% (2020: 14%). The fair value of residents’
loans is categorised as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of retail bonds is based on the price traded at on the NZX market as at 31 December 2021. The fair value of the retail
bonds is categorised as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using inputs from third parties that are observable, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Based on this, the Company and Group have categorised these financial instruments as Level 2
under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Capital management
The Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings. The objective of the Group’s capital management is
to ensure a strong credit position to support business growth and maximise shareholder value. The Group is subject to capital
requirements imposed by the bank lenders (through covenants in the Syndicated Facility Agreement) and bondholders (through
covenants in the Master Trust Deed). The Group has met all of these externally imposed capital requirements for the year ended
31 December 2021 (2020: all requirements met). The Group capital structure is managed, and adjustments are made, with Board
approval. There were no changes to objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2021 (2020: none).

19. Share capital and reserves
At 31 December 2021, there were 230,215,366 ordinary shares on issue (2020: 228,785,314). All ordinary shares are fully paid and have
no par value. All shares carry one vote per share and carry the right to dividends.

to shares held in 100% owned subsidiary, Summerset LTI Trustee Limited. As at 31 December 2021, 788,621 shares are held by
Summerset LTI Trustee Limited for employee share plans, which are eliminated on consolidation. Refer to Note 21 for further details
on employee share plans.

Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve is used to record the revaluation of care centre buildings.

Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record gains or losses on instruments used as cash flow hedges. The amounts are recognised in profit
and loss when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.

Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record the gain on translation of foreign currency subsidiaries to the Group's
reporting currency.

Dividends
On 22 March 2021 a dividend of 7.0 cents per ordinary share was paid to shareholders and on 20 September 2021 a dividend of 9.9
cents per ordinary share was paid to shareholders (2020: on 23 March 2020 a dividend of 7.7 cents per ordinary share was paid to
shareholders and on 11 September 2020 a dividend of 6.0 cents per ordinary share was paid to shareholders).
A dividend reinvestment plan applied to the dividends paid. 493,015 ordinary shares were issued in relation to the plan for the March
2021 dividend and 608,493 ordinary shares were issued in relation to the plan for the September 2021 dividend. (2020: 1,155,370
ordinary shares were issued in March 2020 and 665,095 ordinary shares were issued in September 2020).

21. Employee share plans
Senior employee share plan - share option scheme
Effective from 2018, the Group operates an employee share plan granting share options to selected senior employees ("Participants").
Where applicable, the exercise price of the granted share options is determined from the volume weighted average price on the NZX
during the 10 trading day period determined by the Board prior to the grant. Effective from the 2021 annual option grant, the option
exercise price is set at nil and therefore no option valuation is required.

2 The first tranche of the December 2019 grant had a vesting date of 31 December 2021.

For the 2021 annual option grant, 50% of the vesting criteria is time-based only (non-hurdled) for all Participants, for the remaining
50% of the vesting criteria, the following performance hurdles apply to all Participants:
•

50% underlying net profit after tax

•

20% relative earnings growth

•

20% customer initiatives

•

10% employee initiatives

For annual option grants made between 2018 and 2020, while there is a requirement to remain employed by Summerset up to vesting
date, there are no performance hurdles for vesting of share options to senior management team members, other than the members
of the Executive Leadership Team.
For certain one-off option grants outside of the annual option grant process, performance hurdles are set relating to specific
performance milestones for the relevant Participant.
A total of 903,317 options have vested and are currently exercisable at 31 December 2021 (2020: 576,852). The maximum terms for
options granted range between three and six years.
The share option scheme is an equity-settled scheme and measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at
the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate that
the share options will vest. Where applicable, these options were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the option cost
for the year ending 31 December 2021 of $995,000 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the Group
for that period (2020: $980,000). The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the share options in cash.

Senior employee share plan - share and loan scheme
Up to and including 2017, the Group operated employee share plans for selected senior employees (“Participants”) to purchase
shares in the Company (the "2013 share plan"). The shares for the plans are held by a nominee as share options on behalf of
Participants, until such time after the vesting of shares that the nominee is directed by the Participant that they wish to exercise the
share option, or the shares are sold or cancelled by the nominee if vesting criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as
all other ordinary shares.
The Group provided Participants with interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the acquisition of the shares for these plans. These
loans are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited and eliminate on consolidation.
The issue price of shares under the 2013 share plan was determined from the volume weighted average price on the NZX during the
10 trading days prior to issue.

•

25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group)

•

10% employee initiatives

•

10% customer initiatives

•

While there is a requirement to remain employed by Summerset up to vesting date, there are no performance hurdles for grants
of shares to senior management team members, other than the members of the Executive Leadership Team, whose performance
hurdles are described above.
A total of 313,251 shares were vested and eligible for exercise at 31 December 2021 (2020: 888,346). The exercise prices range from
$5.19 to $5.24 (2020: $4.76 to $5.24).
The share and loan scheme is an equity-settled scheme and is measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate that the shares will vest. These options were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and nil option cost for the year
ending 31 December 2021 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the Group for that period as the shares
under this scheme had fully vested as at 31 December 2020 (2020: $128,000 option cost recognised).

Annual Report 2021

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Shareholders of Summerset Group
Holdings Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Summerset Group Holdings Limited (“the company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the
Group”) on pages 51 to 87, which comprise the statement of financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and the income
statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended
of the Group, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 51 to 87 present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2021 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial
Reporting Standards.

88

This report is made solely to the Company's shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company's shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's
shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of Ethics for Assurance
Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Ernst & Young provides other assurance related and remuneration advisory services to the Group. Partners and employees of our
firm may deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. We have
no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of
the audit report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to
respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures,
including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Valuation and classification of investment property and freehold land and buildings
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

As disclosed in notes 9 and 11 of the consolidated
financial statements:

To address the key audit matter, we:

•

the Group’s investment property portfolio was valued
at $4,580 million at 31 December 2021 and included
completed investment property and investment
property under development

•

the Group’s freehold land buildings were valued at
$247 million at 31 December 2021. This included
freehold land and buildings operated by the Group
for the provision of care services, and buildings to be
developed into care facilities in the future.

The Group’s accounting policy is to measure these assets
at fair value.
Independent valuations of all investment property and
freehold land and buildings were carried out by third
party valuers, CBRE Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle
Limited (the Valuers). The valuation of investment
property and freehold land and buildings is inherently
subjective given that there are alternative assumptions
and valuation methods that may result in a range of
values. As discussed in note 11 of the consolidated
financial statements, the Valuers have advised that a
degree of caution should be exercised when relying
on the valuations. This caution reflects the ongoing
uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Investment property and freehold land and buildings are
recorded in the consolidated financial statements based
on the value determined by the Valuers.
Summerset derives revenue from properties it holds from
both deferred management fees and the provision of
services to residents. NZ IAS 40 requires properties to be
classified as an investment property where the revenue
from the supply of ancillary services is insignificant to the
arrangement as a whole. Judgement is required to assess
the significance of ancillary services in this context.

External valuations
•

read the valuation reports and discussed them with
the Valuers. We assessed the valuation approach and
confirmed that this was in accordance with the relevant
accounting standards; and

•

tested on a sample basis, whether property specific
information supplied to the Valuers by the Group
reflected the underlying property records held by
the Group.

Assumptions and estimates
•

held discussions with the Valuers to gain an
understanding of the assumptions and estimates
used and the valuation methodology applied. This
included understanding the impact that ongoing market
uncertainty had on their assessment of significant inputs
and assumptions. We also sought to understand and
consider whether any restrictions had been imposed on
the valuation process;

•

considered whether the valuation sought to make
appropriate assumptions for a sample of individual
properties to reflect their characteristics, overall quality,
geographic location and desirability as a whole; and

•

engaged our in-house Real estate valuation experts to
challenge the work performed by the Valuers and assess
the reasonableness of the assumptions used based
on their knowledge gained from reviewing valuations
of similar properties, known transactions and available
market data.

Our work over the assumptions focused on the largest
properties within the portfolio and those properties where the
assumptions used and/or year-on-year fair value movement
suggested a possible outlier compared to the rest of the
portfolio and the market data for the sector.
Estimated valuation range
As a result of the judgement involved in determining
valuations for individual properties and the existence of
alternative assumptions and valuation methods, there is a
range of values which can be considered reasonable when
evaluating the independent property valuations used by the
Group. If we identified an error in a property valuation or
determined that the valuation was outside of a reasonable
range, we evaluated the error or difference to determine
if there was a material misstatement in the consolidated
financial statements.
Classification
We considered management’s assessment of the
classification of each type of property as either
investment property or freehold land and buildings,
including assessment against the requirements of the
accounting standards.
Disclosures
We considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in
notes 9 and 11 to the financial statements. These notes explain
the key judgements made in relation to the classification
and valuation of investment property and freehold land
and buildings and the estimation uncertainty involved in
the process.

Annual Report 2021

Deferred Management Fee Revenue Recognition
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Deferred management fee (“DMF”) revenue is 37%
of the Group’s total revenue. The Group recognises
deferred management fee revenue from residents over
the expected period of tenure.

To address the key audit matter, we:

The amount of revenue recognised in each year is
subject to the Group’s judgement of each resident’s
expected tenure in the village as well as the terms of
the occupational right agreement and the type of unit
occupied. A change in the assumed tenure may have a
material impact on revenue recognised in the year.
Disclosures in relation to DMF revenue and the
associated DMF receivable and revenue in advance
balances are included in note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements.

•

for a sample of residents, assessed the accuracy of a
sample of the inputs to, and calculation of, the DMF
revenue recognised during 2021 with reference to the
occupancy right agreements;

•

assessed the movements year on year in revenue
recognised by each village based on an expectation
derived from underlying village data;

•

compared the Group’s assessment of assumed tenure
against actual observed tenure; and

•

assessed the adequacy of the related financial
statement disclosures.

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The Directors of the company are responsible for the Annual Report, which includes information other than the consolidated financial
statements and auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

90

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge
obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based upon the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the entity, for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial
Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing on behalf of the entity the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the External Reporting
Board’s website: https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards-for-assurance-practitioners/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Governance
Summerset has adopted the principles below as an appropriate way to demonstrate its commitment to best practice
governance and to provide transparency in the Company’s approach to corporate governance for the benefit of
its shareholders and other stakeholders. These principles are from the NZX Corporate Governance Code issued in
December 2020 ('NZX Code'). Each principle of the NZX Code is set out below with an explanation on how Summerset
meets it.
As at 31 December 2021, Summerset considers that it was in full compliance with NZX Listing Rules and the NZX Code.
The Code of Ethics Policy, Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Whistle Blowing
Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy, and Modern Slavery Policy can be found on the
Company’s website and internal intranet.

Principle 1: Code of ethical behaviour
'Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management
accountable for these standards being followed throughout the organisation.'
Ethical standards
The Board maintains high standards of ethical conduct and expects the Company’s employees to act legally and with
integrity in a manner consistent with the policies, guiding principles and values that are in place. These include
the following:
92

•

Code of Ethics This guide sets out the basic principles of legal and ethical conduct expected of all employees
and Directors. The Company encourages open and honest communication by staff about any current or potential
problem, complaint, suggestion, concern or question.

•

Securities Trading Policy In accordance with the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, the NZX Listing Rules and
the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, Directors and employees of the Company are subject to limitations on
their ability to buy or sell Company shares.

•

Diversity and Inclusion Policy This policy outlines the Company’s guiding principles for diversity and inclusion.
Refer to Principle 2 for further details.

•

Code of Conduct This policy sets out the expected behaviours while in employment with the Company. Company
employees are expected to act honestly, conscientiously, reasonably and in good faith, while at all times having
regard to their responsibilities, the interests of Summerset, and the welfare of our residents and staff.

•

Whistle Blowing Policy This policy encourages employees to come forward if they have concerns regarding
serious wrongdoing, and ensures that employees have access to a confidential process in which they can report
any issues in relation to serious wrongdoing without fear of reprisal or victimisation.

•

Conflicts of interest Summerset's Code of Ethics outlines the standards of integrity, professionalism and
confidentiality to which all employees and Directors of the Company must adhere with respect to their work and
behaviour. To maintain integrity in decision-making, each Director must advise the Board of any potential conflict
of interest if such arises. If a conflict of interest exists, the Director concerned will have no involvement in the
decision-making process relating to the matter.

•

Gift Policy This policy governs the acceptance and reporting of benefits given to staff by third parties.

•

Interests Register In accordance with the Companies Act 1993 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, the
Company maintains an Interests Register in which all relevant transactions and matters involving the Directors
are recorded.

Supplier Code of Conduct and Modern Slavery Policy These documents set out the minimum standards
expected of Summerset’s suppliers and support Summerset’s commitment to sustainable, ethical and
inclusive procurement.

•

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy This policy sets out Summerset’s zero-tolerance approach to bribery and
corruption. It also makes it clear that donations to political parties are not permitted.

Principle 2: Board composition and performance
'To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience
and perspectives.'
Role of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is elected by Shareholders, and has responsibility for taking appropriate steps to protect and
enhance the value of the assets of the Company in the best interests of its Shareholders. The Board has adopted a
formal Board Charter detailing its authority, responsibilities, membership and operation.
The key responsibilities of the Board include setting the overall direction and strategy of the Company, establishing
appropriate policies and monitoring performance of management. The Board appoints the Chief Executive Officer
and delegates the day-to-day operating of the business to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer
implements policies and strategies set by the Board and is accountable to it. The Board also has responsibility
for ensuring the Company’s financial position is sound, and financial statements comply with generally accepted
accounting practice, and that the Company adheres to high standards of ethical and corporate behaviour.
A summary of the Board mandate is as follows:
•

A majority of the Board should be Independent Directors as defined in the NZX Listing Rules;

•

The Chair of the Board should be independent;

•

The Chair and the Chief Executive Officer should be different people;

•

Directors should possess a broad range of skills, qualifications and experience, and remain current on how best to
perform their duties as Directors;

•

Information of sufficient content, quality and timeliness as the Board considers necessary shall be provided by
management to allow the Board to discharge its duties effectively and;

•

The effectiveness and performance of the Board and its individual members should be re-evaluated on
an annual basis.

Directors receive an induction upon appointment to the Board to ensure their full knowledge of the Company and the
industry in which it operates. The Directors are expected to keep themselves abreast of changes and trends in the
business and to keep themselves up to date to ensure they best perform their duties as Directors of the Company.
All Directors have been issued letters setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment.
Delegation of authority
The Board delegates to the Chief Executive Officer responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy and for
managing the Company’s operations. The Chief Executive Officer and management have Board-approved levels of
authority and, in turn, sub-delegate authority in some cases to direct reports. This is documented in the Delegated
Authority Policy.

Annual Report 2021

Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution and the NZX Listing Rules, Directors are required to retire three years
after their appointment or at the third Annual Shareholder Meeting following their appointment (whichever is later).
Directors who have been appointed by the Board must also retire at the next Annual Shareholder Meeting following
their appointment.
The Board Charter states that it is not generally expected that a non-executive Director would hold office for more
than 10 years or be nominated for more than three consecutive terms. The Board Charter also provides that Directors
may accept other board appointments only where that does not detrimentally affect their performance as a Director of
Summerset. In making this assessment, the number and nature of a Director’s other governance roles may be relevant.
Directors may offer themselves for re-election by Shareholders each year at the Annual Shareholder Meeting.
Procedures for the appointment and removal of Directors are also governed by the Constitution.
The People and Culture Committee identifies and nominates candidates to fill Director vacancies for Board approval.
Information about candidates for election or re-election is included in the Notice of Meeting to assist Shareholders in
deciding whether or not to elect or re-elect the candidate.
Board composition
The Company’s Constitution prescribes that the Board shall be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, with at
least two Directors ordinarily resident in New Zealand. As at 31 December 2021, the Board was comprised of seven
non-executive Independent Directors. In determining whether a Director is Independent, the Board has regard to the
NZX Listing Rules.
The Board considers all current Directors to be Independent in that they are not executives of the Company and do
not have a direct or indirect interest or relationship that could reasonably influence, in a material way, their decisions
in relation to the Company.

94

As at 31 December 2021, the non-executive Independent Directors were Mark Verbiest (Chair), Dr Andrew Wong,
Anne Urlwin, Gráinne Troute, James Ogden, Dr Marie Bismark and Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley.
The Board is comprised of Directors who have a mix of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity to adequately
meet and discharge its responsibilities and to add value to the Company through efficient and effective governance
leadership. The current Directors have a varied and balanced mix of skills relevant to the Group’s operations.
A summary of the key skills and experience held across the Board as at 31 December 2021, is set out in the
table opposite.

More information on the Directors, including their interests, qualifications and security holdings, is provided in the
Board of Directors and Disclosures sections of this report. As a term of their appointment, Directors are required to
acquire and hold shares in the Company to the value of one year’s worth of director fees. They have two years in which
to acquire the shares. Once this requirement has been achieved at a point in time, it is deemed satisfied and is not
affected by future fluctuations in share price. This shareholding requirement may be satisfied by a Director holding
shares through an associated person or entity.
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings. The Directors generally receive material for Board meetings five working
days in advance, except in the case of special meetings, for which the time period may be shorter owing to the urgency
of the matter to be considered.

95

Annual Report 2021

The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings, and in this capacity is accountable directly to the Board, through
the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board.
All Directors have access to the Executive Leadership Team to discuss issues or obtain information on specific areas
in relation to items to be considered at Board meetings or other areas as considered appropriate. Key executives and
managers are invited to attend and participate in appropriate sessions at Board meetings. Directors have unrestricted
access to Company records and information.
Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice relating to the affairs of the Company or other
responsibilities. Prior approval of the Chair is required before seeking such advice and Directors are expected to
ensure that the cost of such advice is reasonable.
Diversity and inclusion
The Company and its Board are committed to a workplace culture that promotes and values diversity and
inclusiveness. This is outlined in the Company’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which is available on
the Company’s website.
Diversity is defined as the characteristics that make one individual different from another. Diversity encompasses
gender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, physical capability, family responsibilities, education, cultural
background and more.
Inclusion is defined as a sense of belonging, respecting and valuing all individuals, providing fair access to opportunity,
and removing discrimination and other barriers to involvement. The Board recognises that inclusion leads to a better
experience of work for Summerset’s employees, makes teams stronger, leads to greater creativity and performance,
contributes to a more meaningful relationship with residents, their families and stakeholders, and ultimately increases
value to Shareholders.

96

The Board believes that diversity across the workforce makes Summerset stronger and better able to connect with,
and bring the best of life to, residents on a day-to-day basis. When there is a variety of thinking styles, backgrounds,
experiences, perspectives and abilities, employees are more able to understand residents’ needs and to respond
effectively to them.
The Diversity and Inclusion Policy states that the objective for achieving diversity is to: 'Actively engage, communicate
and develop our people leaders and our employees to enhance the awareness and understanding of diversity
and inclusion that enhances our organisational culture and positively contributes to delivering the “best of life” for
our customer.'
During 2021 we updated our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and its three-year plan following significant quantitative
and qualitative feedback from our staff through two diversity and inclusion surveys and a series of employee focus
groups and leader interviews. The surveys achieved an average 66% response rate and we received over 6,500
survey comments.
Our Diversity and Inclusion Policy was enhanced during the year with the development of bicultural commitments,
and we started collecting broader diversity data from our employees to better understand the breadth of our staff
demographic. We also designed and developed a cultural awareness programme, which will roll out to all staff and
leaders during 2022.
Each year the Board reviews and assesses performance against this objective. The Board considers that for the year
ended 31 December 2021, the objective for achieving diversity has been met.
As at 31 December 2021 (and 31 December 2020 for the prior comparative period), the mix of gender of those
employed by the Company is set out in the table on the opposite page.
The Executive Leadership Team comprises the Chief Executive Officer and all general managers who report to the
Chief Executive Officer.
These figures include permanent full-time, permanent part-time, fixed-term and casual employees, but not
independent contractors.

Board performance
The Board is committed to evaluating its performance on a regular basis, generally with a formal, external review
bi-annually and an internal self-review each intervening year. The process, including evaluation criteria, is considered
by the People and Culture Committee and approved by the Board.
Executive Leadership Team performance
The Board evaluates annually the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer reviews
the performance of direct reports, and reports to the Board on those reviews. The evaluation is based on criteria
that include the performance of the business and the accomplishment of longer-term strategic objectives. It may
include quantitative and qualitative measures. During the most recent financial year, performance evaluations were
conducted in accordance with this process.

Principle 3: Board committees
'The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining
board responsibility.'
Board committees
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the People and Culture Committee, the Clinical
Governance Committee, and the Development and Construction Committee. Each committee operates under a
charter approved by the Board, and any recommendations they make are recommendations to the Board. The charter
for each committee is reviewed annually. All Directors are entitled to attend committee meetings.
Audit Committee
While the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting rests with the Board,
the Company has in place processes to ensure the accurate presentation of its financial position. These include:
•

An appropriately resourced Audit Committee operating under a written charter, with specific responsibilities for
financial reporting and risk management;

•

Review and consideration by the Audit Committee of the financial information and preliminary releases of results
to the market, which then makes recommendations to the Board;

•

A process to ensure the independence and competence of the Company’s external auditors and a process to
ensure their compliance with the Company’s External Audit Independence Policy;

•

Responsibility for appointment of the external auditors residing with the Audit Committee; and

•

Monitoring by the Audit Committee of the strength of the internal control environment by considering the
effectiveness and adequacy of Summerset’s internal controls, reviewing the findings of the external auditor's
review of internal control over financial reporting, and being involved in setting the scope for the internal
audit programme.

97

Annual Report 2021

One of the main purposes of the Audit Committee is to ensure the quality and independence of the external audit
process. The Audit Committee make enquiries of management and the external auditors so that it is satisfied as to the
validity and accuracy of all aspects of the Company’s financial reporting. All aspects of the external audit are reported
back to the Audit Committee and the external auditors are given the opportunity at Audit Committee meetings to meet
with Directors.
The Audit Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors, the majority of whom must be Independent. The
Audit Committee is chaired by an Independent Director who is not the Chair of the Board. The Committee currently
comprises James Ogden (Chair), Anne Urlwin, Mark Verbiest and Gráinne Troute.
The Audit Committee generally invites the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Manager
Corporate Services, Head of Finance, internal auditors and external auditors to attend meetings. The Committee also
meets and receives regular reports from the external auditors without management present, concerning any matters
that arise in connection with the performance of their role.
People and Culture Committee
The role of the People and Culture Committee is to assist the Board in establishing and reviewing remuneration
policies and practices, culture, leadership and capability, succession, employee development, inclusion, diversity and
engagement for the Company and in reviewing Board composition. Specific objectives include:

98

•

Supporting the Board in ensuring the Company's vision and commitment to its people strategy is aligned with, and
an enabler of, the Company's business strategy;

•

Assisting the Board in planning the Board’s composition;

•

Evaluating the competencies required of prospective Directors (both non-executive and executive);

•

Identifying those prospective Directors and establishing their degree of independence;

•

Developing the succession plans for the Board, and making recommendations to the Board accordingly;

•

Overseeing the process of the Board’s annual performance self-assessment and the performance of the Directors;

•

Establishing remuneration policies and practices, and setting and reviewing the remuneration of the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer, Executive Leadership Team and Directors; and

•

substantive changes.

The People and Culture Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors, the majority of whom must be
Independent. The Committee currently comprises Gráinne Troute (Chair), Dr Marie Bismark, James Ogden,
Anne Urlwin and Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley.
The Board’s policy is that the Board needs to have an appropriate mix of skills, experience and diversity to ensure that
it is well equipped. The Board reviews and evaluates on a regular basis the skill mix required, and identifies
any existing gaps.
Clinical Governance Committee
The role of the Clinical Governance Committee is to assist the Board in ensuring a systematic approach to maintaining
and improving the quality of care provided by the Company. Specific objectives include:
•

Providing oversight that appropriate clinical governance mechanisms are in place and are effective throughout
the organisation;

•

Supporting the leadership role of the Chief Executive Officer in relation to issues of quality, safety and clinical risk;

•

Working with management to identify priorities for improvement;

•

Ensuring that the principles and standards of clinical governance are applied to the health improvement and health
protection activities of the Board; and

•

Ensuring that appropriate mechanisms are in place for the effective engagement of representatives of residents
and clinical staff.

The Clinical Governance Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors. The Committee currently
comprises Dr Marie Bismark (Chair), Anne Urlwin, Gráinne Troute and Dr Andrew Wong.

Development and Construction Committee
The role of the Development and Construction Committee is to assist the Board in:
•

Supporting management to establish and achieve development and construction objectives within the
Company’s long-term plan;

•

Supporting management to develop and implement strategies to achieve the Company’s development and
construction objectives in line with best practice;

•

Helping the Company maintain appropriate risk management strategies to identify, mitigate and manage
development and construction risks;

•

Principle 4: Reporting and disclosure
'The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance
of corporate disclosures.'
Making timely and balanced disclosures
The Company is committed to promoting Shareholder confidence through open, timely and accurate market
communication. The Company has in place procedures designed to ensure compliance with its disclosure obligations
under the NZX and ASX Listing Rules. The Company’s Market Disclosure and Communications Policy sets out the
responsibilities of the Board and management in disclosure and communication, and procedures for managing
this obligation.
Copies of key governance documents, including the Code of Ethics, Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines, Board
and Committee Charters, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Board and Executive Remuneration Policy, and Market
Disclosure and Communications Policy are all available on the Company’s website at https://www.summerset.co.nz/
investor-centre/governance-documents.
Non-financial disclosures, such as the Company’s approach to health and safety, our people, the community and the
environment are included within this Annual Report.

Principle 5: Remuneration
'The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.'

100

Remuneration of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team is reviewed by the Board’s People and Culture
Committee. Its membership and role are set out under Principle 3. The committee makes recommendations to the
Board on remuneration packages, keeping in mind the requirements of the Board and Executive Remuneration Policy.
The level of remuneration paid to the Directors and the Executive Leadership Team will be determined by the Board.
However, Directors’ fees must be within the limits approved by the Shareholders of the Company.
Further details on remuneration are provided in the Remuneration section of this Annual Report.

Principle 6: Risk management
'Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them.
The Board should regularly verify that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential
and material risks.'

101

The Board is responsible for overseeing the management of risks across Summerset’s business. Summerset has
robust risk management and reporting frameworks in place, whereby material business risks are regularly identified,
monitored and managed. Summerset does not currently have a separate risk committee. However, key risks
are regularly reported to the Board, together with Summerset’s approach to risk management. Summerset's risk
management framework was reviewed by the Board in the 2021 financial year and a move to an enterprise risk
management policy in 2022 was endorsed by the Board.
The members of Summerset’s Executive Leadership Team are required to regularly identify the major risks affecting
the business, record them in the Risk Register (which identifies the likelihood and consequence of each risk to
Summerset’s business), and develop structures, practices and processes to manage and monitor these risks.
Summerset has a co-sourced model for internal audit and an in-house Internal Audit Manager. As part of the
co-sourced model, Summerset has engaged KPMG as its partner to assist with carrying out internal audit work
on various parts of the Group’s operations, and all major risk and internal control issues are reported on at each
Board meeting.

Annual Report 2021

Health and safety (including in relation to risks, performance and management) is discussed regularly at Board
meetings and specific reviews are sought as required. Monthly reporting is prepared and used to assist in risk
management, covering areas such as health and safety incidents, injury and near-miss frequency rates, and actions
undertaken. Further information is covered in the health and safety section of this Annual Report on page 25.
Summerset has a Tax Governance Policy in place, which sets out its tax risk management objectives, tax reporting
requirements to the Audit Committee, and policies and processes to manage tax risk. This Tax Governance Policy
is reviewed by the Board every two years. It is next due for review in December 2022. The Board is satisfied
that Summerset has effective policies and processes in place to ensure the Company is meeting its obligations.
Summerset adopts a risk-averse stance in relation to tax issues and, where possible, seeks certainty on tax positions
through proactive engagement with tax authorities.
Summerset has considered whether it has any material exposure to economic, environmental and social sustainability
risks (as defined in the ASX Corporate Governance Principles) and has determined the following:
•

Climate change risk Over the longer term, Summerset expects to operate in a climate that will progressively
depart from the weather conditions and events currently experienced, to more acute challenges and risks arising
from increasing climate variability. This is likely to have various impacts on the longer-term plans and operation of
the Group – specifically in relation to the design, build and construction of villages, as well as in the provision of
care services to frail residents and the overall lifestyle satisfaction enjoyed in Summerset’s villages.
These measures and our approach to sustainability are discussed in more detail on page 37 of this report.

•

Property market risk Property market factors could adversely affect sales volumes, occupancy levels or prices.
This may have a flow-on impact to the value of Summerset’s property assets and the associated property
valuations, which would in turn impact Summerset’s financial performance.

•

Staff retention and capability risk In a tight and highly competitive labour market, Summerset is at risk of staff
shortages. Key areas within our construction and nursing teams will continue to be monitored closely.

•

Corporate governance and compliance risk Failure to comply with regulatory, societal and investor
expectations in relation to corporate governance and environmental sustainability could impact Summerset’s
reputation and financial performance over the longer term. Summerset's governance procedures are
continually monitored.

•

Strategy and innovation risk There is a moderate risk with regard to Summerset’s strategic direction and ability
to continue to innovate. Summerset’s intention is to stay at the forefront in all areas of its business, including
technology, design, development and care. In 2021 we established an innovation programme, which is already
showing benefits to the business.

•

Diversity and inclusion risk While our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and annual plans fulfil all our obligations
in this area and we continue to improve our culture, there is always some level of risk, particularly in a tight labour
market. This will continue to be monitored regularly through staff surveys and employees being actively engaged
in this area. Page 96 provides more information on the Company's Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.

•

COVID-19 risk As New Zealand transitions to living with COVID-19, the risk of an outbreak at a village (and the
associated negative publicity) will increase. However, global research and work on vaccines and treatments, and
the high vaccination rates among Summerset staff and residents, mean we are in a good position. There remains
a risk of materials shortages and/or cost escalations due to the impacts of the pandemic on global supply chains.

•

Construction and development risk Summerset faces construction and property development risks when
developing new villages. These risks include project delays, default risk, governance and design risk, and potential
labour and materials shortages. There is also a risk of supply chain cost inflation due to COVID-19 related shortages
and delays.

•

Clinical care risk This is a high-risk area for Summerset, which requires constant monitoring, management
and policy review. Good training and professional development, retention of staff, and investment in health and
safety all help mitigate risk in this area. The increasing level of investment required in this area is likely to affect
care profitability.

•

Resident and customer experience risk Providing top-level resident and customer experience at all times is a
challenge due to the nature of the organisation. Summerset has various methods in which it manages and monitors
these issues closely, including move-in surveys, on-going resident feedback surveys, close one-on-one feedback
sessions, and close contact with residents, families, next of kin and prospective residents.

102

•

Occupational health and safety risk This remains a material risk. Its importance has increased further this year for
staff given the mental health risks associated with the uncertainty of COVID-19. The physical and mental wellbeing
of all Summerset staff is one of our top priorities.

•

Australia market entry risk Entering a new market requires a measured and well-researched approach.
Summerset is mitigating many new market entry risks by setting up a new local team, entering a well-researched
market, and developing product and service offerings, procedures and processes tailored for the new market.
Progress in Australia will be closely managed, and has tracked well to date.

•

Data privacy and confidentiality risk Summerset actively monitors and manages these risks through its risk
management and reporting frameworks.

•

Asset maintenance and upgrades risk Summerset has a coordinated approach to asset management and
upgrades in all areas of the business. This is constantly up for review and progress is managed accordingly.

•

Sector penetration rates risk Summerset is fortunate to operate in the high-growth New Zealand
retirement sector. The risk is a declining penetration (or participation) in the market. Current forecasts show this
is unlikely to be the case in New Zealand, but it is a risk to be monitored. Competitors making significant changes
to their revenue models or pricing strategy could impact on the revenue earned by Summerset.

•

Reputational risk Summerset operates in a sensitive market involving care of vulnerable members of society.
Summerset’s performance and reputation could be adversely impacted should it suffer adverse publicity,
particularly in respect of care or health and safety issues.

•

Regulatory change risk Changes in regulation could have a material impact on Summerset’s business operations.
There is a possibility of amendments to the existing retirement villages regulatory regime, as well as changes to
the aged care regime in Australia following the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Summerset
has already adopted many of the recommended changes in advance of any legislative change.

Principle 7: Auditors
103

'The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.'
The Board’s relationship with its auditors, both external and internal, is governed by the Audit Committee Charter,
External Audit Independence Policy and the Internal Audit Charter. These charters and policies set out the types of
engagements that can be performed by the external and internal auditors. The Audit Committee actively monitors the
amount of any non-audit work completed by the external auditor to ensure that independence is maintained.
The external auditor (Ernst & Young) attends the Company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting and is available to answer
questions from Shareholders in relation to the external audit.
Ernst & Young was first appointed as external auditor of Summerset in 2004. In 2017, a full tender for the external audit
services was completed and Ernst & Young was reappointed through this process. The lead audit partner was last
changed in 2018, with the appointment of Grant Taylor.
KPMG was appointed in the role of internal auditor of the Company in December 2016. With the establishment of
a co-source model approach to internal audit in 2020, it currently remains the Company's co-source partner. The
internal audit role is governed by the Internal Audit Charter, which states the objectives and scope of internal audit
activities. The primary objective of internal audit is to increase the strength of the Company’s control environment.
This is guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Company. The internal audit assists
the Company in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and
improving the effectiveness of its governance, risk management and internal controls. The Internal Audit Programme
is set annually by the Audit Committee.

Annual Report 2021

The Internal Audit Charter sets out the scope of internal audit activities and this encompasses, but is not limited
to, objective examinations of evidence to provide independent assessments on the adequacy and effectiveness of
operations, governance, risk management and control processes for Summerset. This includes evaluating whether:
•

The actions of Summerset’s officers, directors, staff, and contractors comply with Summerset’s policies,
procedures and applicable laws, regulations and governance standards;

•

The results of operations or programmes are consistent with established goals and objectives;

•

Operations or programs are being carried out effectively and efficiently, with adequate internal controls;

•

Established processes and systems enable compliance with the policies, procedures, laws and regulations that
could significantly impact Summerset;

•

Information and the means used to identify, measure, analyse, classify and report such information is reliable and
has integrity; and

•

Resources and assets are acquired economically, used efficiently and protected adequately.

Principle 8: Shareholder rights and relations
'The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders
that encourage them to engage with the issuer.'
Respecting the rights of Shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that its Shareholders understand its activities by communicating effectively with them
and giving them ready access to clear and balanced information about the Company.
To assist with this, the Company’s website is maintained with relevant information, including copies of presentations
and reports. The Company’s key corporate governance policies are also included on the website.
104

The Company’s major communications with Shareholders during the financial year include its annual and half-year
reports and the Annual Shareholder Meeting. The annual and half-year reports are available in electronic and
hard-copy format.
Communicating with Shareholders
The Company welcomes communication and feedback from Shareholders. The Company’s investor centre (on its
website) provides a Company phone number and email address for communications from Shareholders and investor
relations enquiries. All Shareholder communications are responded to within a reasonable timeframe.
The Company provides options for Shareholders to receive and send communications electronically, to and from both
the Company and its share and bond registrar. The Company’s investor centre includes contact details for Link Market
Services, through which all Company shares and bonds are managed.
Shareholder voting rights
Shareholders have the right to vote on major decisions as required by the NZX Listing Rules. Further information on
Shareholder voting rights is set out in the Company’s Constitution.
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings are sent to Shareholders and published on the Company’s website
at least 20 working days prior to the relevant meeting.

Remuneration
Remuneration overview
Remuneration philosophy
Summerset’s purpose is to 'Bring the Best of Life' to our residents. Achieving this is dependent on motivated
employees performing at a consistently high level. A competitive and affordable remuneration structure that
is equitable and attractive is an important contributory factor for this high level of employee engagement.
Remuneration encompasses wages, salaries, incentives, non-reimbursing allowances, and a range of employee
benefits including KiwiSaver.
Executive remuneration is set by the People and Culture Committee in accordance with the principles laid out in the
People and Culture Committee Charter.
Market position
Summerset benchmarks pay rates to a market median position. This allows for a balance of competitiveness (i.e. at
mid-market, some employers will pay more and others will pay less) and affordability (i.e. paying at the level necessary
to attract good people while controlling costs). A review of market relativity is conducted annually to ensure that
Summerset remains competitive and has cost-effective pay practices. The market review draws on a number of data
sources, for example:

110

•

Remuneration survey data from the New Zealand Aged Care Association;

•

Competitive remuneration information available by subscription to remuneration specialist databases;

•

Wage and employment information produced by Statistics New Zealand.

The market review determines whether pay ranges that are linked to market benchmarks have remained competitive
or should be adjusted as part of the annual remuneration review process.
Benefits
Summerset offers an attractive benefits package to permanent employees, including:
•

Southern Cross Health Essentials health insurance;

•

Employee Share Scheme – currently $1,000 worth of Summerset shares each year subject to Trust Deed
and Scheme Rules;

•

Birthday leave;

•

10 days of sick leave available from day one of employment;

•

Long service leave and additional surgical health insurance after five years;

•

Employee Assistance Programme;

•

Recruitment referral payments;

•

Quarterly draw to win vouchers worth $3,000;

•

Contributions to fundraising and sports teams;

•

Interest-free loans during times of hardship;

•

Weekend allowance, uniforms and overtime for care centre roles;

•

Professional Development and Recognition Programme (PDRP) payments and indemnity insurance for nurses;

•

Meals for night shift staff; and

•

Short-term incentives and long-term incentive share option plan for specific roles.

judgements, fines, penalties, legal costs awarded and defence costs arising from wrongful acts committed while
acting for Summerset. There are some exclusions within the policy. The insurance cover is supplemented by the
provision of Director and Officer indemnities from the Company, but this does not extend to criminal acts.

Annual Report 2021

Executive remuneration
The remuneration of members of the Executive Leadership Team (Chief Executive Officer and direct reports) is
designed to promote a high-performance culture and to align Executive reward to the development and achievement
of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders.
The Board is assisted in delivering its responsibilities and objectives for Executive remuneration by the People and
Culture Committee. The role and membership of this committee is set out in the Governance section of this report.
Summerset’s remuneration policy for members of the Executive Leadership Team provides the opportunity for
them to receive, where performance merits, a total remuneration package in the upper quartile for equivalent
market-matched roles. The People and Culture Committee reviews the annual performance outcomes for all
Executive Leadership Team members, including the Chief Executive Officer. The review takes into account external
benchmarking to ensure competitiveness with comparable market peers, along with consideration of an individual’s
performance, skills, expertise and experience.
Total remuneration is made up of three components: fixed remuneration, short-term incentive (STI) and long-term
incentive (LTI).
Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of a base salary and benefits. Summerset’s policy is to pay fixed remuneration with
reference to the fixed pay market median.
Short-term incentives
Short-term incentives (STIs) are at-risk payments designed to motivate and reward for performance, typically in that
financial year. The target value of an STI payment is set annually, as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team
member’s fixed remuneration. For 2021, the relevant percentages were 20–30% (2020: 20–40%).
112

A proportion of the STI is related to achievement of annual performance metrics, which aim to align executives to a
shared set of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on business priorities for the next 12 months. Target areas for
the shared KPIs for 2021 are outlined below:
Target

On-target weighting

Maximum performance

40%

48%

New sales development margin*

Total payable

94%

100%

112%

There are three performance levels within each target area – gate-opener, on-target and maximum performance - with
100% of the amount allocated to that target area being payable when the on-target level is achieved. Performance
against both financial and non-financial measures are assessed and approved by the Board each year.
The balance of the STI is related to individual performance measures.
In the event that gate-opener underlying EBITDA performance against budget is not achieved, no STI payment will
be made. The gate opener is based on achieving 100% of underlying EBITDA performance target (90% pay-out in
relation to this target). In addition, the areas of new sales development margin and the resales net cash pay out 90%
on achievement of performance targets. Including the other targets, this would mean a total pay-out of 94%.
A 100% pay-out is based on achieving 110% of the financial targets (*) and meeting all the other KPI target criteria.

The maximum performance levels allow employees to be rewarded for performance above on-target levels. The
maximum amount of an STI payment for an Executive Leadership Team member is 112% of the STI on-target amount
for that Executive Leadership Team member and is based on achieving 120% or more of the financial targets (*) and
meeting all the other KPI target criteria.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives (LTIs) are at-risk payments made through a share plan, designed to align the reward of Executive
Leadership Team members with the enhancement of shareholder value over a multi-year period.
LTI Plan
The Executive Leadership Team members are participants of an LTI option plan. Under this plan, Executive Leadership
Team members are granted share options. These share options are exercisable in relation to shares in Summerset
Group Holdings Limited.
Option grants are made annually, with the value of each grant being set at the date of each grant and determined as a
percentage of the Executive Leadership Team member’s fixed remuneration. For the three annual option grants under
this plan in 2018, 2019 and 2020, the relevant percentages were 20% to 40%. Vesting of these share option grants is
subject to achievement of performance hurdles, which are assessed over two and three-year periods.
During 2021, the Board undertook an extensive review of the LTI plan and the scheme was amended:
•

The option grants as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team member’s fixed remuneration ranged from
20% to 30% ;

•

Options are “zero priced” (prior grants had an exercise price based on 10 day volume weighted average price
(VWAP) prior to issue);

•

Each grant has two tranches (as per prior grants) with the first tranche now vesting at three years and the second
tranche at four years; and

•

50% of each tranche vests based on time (retention) and 50% vests based on performance hurdles.

The performance hurdle portion of each tranche is based on:
•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget);

•

20% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group);

•

10% clinical strategy delivery;

•

5% staff engagement;

•

5% staff turnover;

•

5% customer satisfaction – village residents; and

•

5% customer satisfaction – care centre residents.

The performance hurdles above are consistent with those for the annual option grants in prior years.
Each performance hurdle has a gate opener, which if met results in 50% of the options related to that performance
hurdle vesting for that tranche. Where all performance hurdles for a tranche meet gate opener requirements, and
including that tranche's time-based options, a total of 55.6% of that tranche's options vest.
On-target performance of all performance hurdles for a tranche results, including that tranche's time-based portion,
results in a total of 74.1% of that tranche's options vesting.
100% of the options for each tranche vests when the absolute and relative earnings financial performance hurdles
(*) achieve 125% (or above) of the on-target performance requirement, and all other performance hurdles meet their
on-target performance criteria – this includes the tranche's time-based options.
Performance hurdles are set by the Board with the objective of aligning executive reward to the development and
achievement of strategies and business objectives creating sustainable value for shareholders. The Board considers
the performance hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for shareholders.

113

Annual Report 2021

For certain one-off option grants outside of the annual option grant process, performance hurdles are set relating to
specific performance milestones for the relevant participant.
In addition to the LTI share option plan in place for Executive Leadership Team members, Summerset also operates
an LTI share option plan for other senior managers. The 2018, 2019 and 2020 grants did not have any performance
hurdles. For 2021 (and future grants), senior managers invited to participate will do so on the same terms and
conditions as the Executive, with the number of options granted based on a percentage of fixed remuneration ranging
from 12% to 18%.
With the change in vesting periods from two and three years to three and four years, the Board approved a one-off
transition grant for existing participants. The transition grant consisted of two tranches with the first tranche vesting at
two years and the second tranche at three years. The options granted were zero priced and are time (retention) based
with no performance hurdle requirements.
A total of 173,238 share options were granted to Executive Leadership Team members in December 2021, including
73,740 transition grant options (262,324 in December 2020).
444,640 Executive share options vested as at 31 December 2021 and are therefore currently exercisable subject to
Board confirmation of satisfaction of performance hurdle achievement and approval.
The Executive Leadership Team includes the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer Remuneration
section provides further details of share option movements under the LTI Plan for the Chief Executive Officer.
LTI Plan prior to 2018
Prior to 2018, Executive Leadership Team members were able to purchase shares in Summerset Group Holdings
Limited under an LTI share purchase plan. The shares under this plan are held by a nominee on behalf of the Executive
Leadership Team members until such time after the vesting of shares that the nominee is directed by the Executive
Leadership Team member to transfer or sell the shares, or the shares are sold or cancelled by the nominee if vesting
criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as all other ordinary shares.
114

The Group has provided Executive Leadership Team members participating in the LTI share purchase plans with
interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the acquisition of the shares for these plans. These loans must be repaid
in full before shares are transferred to Executives from the nominee.
Grants under this plan were made annually, with performance measured over two- and three-year periods. The value
of each grant was set at the date of the grant and determined as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team
member’s fixed remuneration, ranging from 15% to 40%. Vesting of shares is subject to achievement of performance
hurdles, which were assessed over two- and three-year periods.
The performance hurdles for the grants made in 2017 were based on:
•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget);

•

25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group);

•

10% employee initiatives;

•

10% customer initiatives; and

•

5% clinical strategy initiatives.

Performance hurdles were set by the Board with the objective of aligning Executive reward to the development and
achievement of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders. The Board considers
that the performance hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for Shareholders.
In addition to the LTI share purchase plan in place for Executive Leadership Team members, Summerset also operated
an unhurdled LTI share purchase plan for other senior managers.
A total of 290,664 vested shares are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited under the LTI share purchase plan on
behalf of the Executive Leadership Team as at 31 December 2021.
The Executive Leadership Team includes the Chief Executive Officer. The following section provides further details of
share movements under the LTI Plan for the Chief Executive Officer.

Pay gap
The pay gap represents the number of times greater the Chief Executive Officer remuneration is to the remuneration
of an employee paid at the median of all Summerset employees. For the purposes of determining the median paid
to all Summerset employees, all permanent full-time, permanent part-time and fixed-term employees are included,
with part-time employee remuneration adjusted to a full-time equivalent amount.
At 31 December 2021, the Chief Executive Officer’s base salary of $649,631 was 11.4 times (2020: 11.8 times) that of the
median employee at $56,846 per annum. The Chief Executive Officer’s total remuneration, including STIs and LTIs, of
$1,273,209, was 21.6 times (2020: 21.5 times) the total remuneration of the median employee at $58,988 per annum.
