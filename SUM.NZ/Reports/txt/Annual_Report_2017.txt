Underlying profit differs from NZ IFRS profit for the period. The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure to
assist readers in determining the realised and non-realised components of fair value movement of investment property
and tax expense in the Group’s income statement. The measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures
to monitor performance and make investment decisions and has been audited by Ernst & Young. Underlying profit is an
industry-wide measure which the Group uses consistently across reporting periods.

Chair’s
Report
Welcome to Summerset’s Annual Report for the financial year to
31 December 2017. The results reflect continued sound performance from
the business in its 20th year of operation. In 2017 Summerset delivered net
profit after tax of $223.4 million, a 54% increase on 2016, and an underlying
profit of $81.7 million, an increase of 44% on 2016.
These results come from achieving our purpose
of bringing the best of life to our residents by
ensuring they have the best homes, care and
lifestyle and making life at a Summerset village
a great experience.
We continue to expand our offering with three
land purchases in 2017, being Kenepuru in
Wellington, Avonhead in Christchurch and an
additional two hectares alongside our Casebrook
village. We opened the main building in our
new Ellerslie village and won the best built

Pg 13

environment award at the New Zealand Aged
Care Association annual awards for our purposebuilt memory care centre in Levin.
Our memory care concept sees people with
dementia living in their own one bedroom
apartment, supported by leading technology
and within a wider secure memory care centre.
This gives them their own home and a sense of
independence in a safe and caring environment.
Summerset is the first in New Zealand to launch
this style of apartment living for people with

Award-winning Levin memory care centre

dementia. We intend to implement it in future
villages, starting with Casebrook in Christchurch
and Rototuna in Hamilton, both of which are
currently under development.
With 23 villages and another six for development
in New Zealand, Summerset has grown quickly
since its first village opened in Wanganui on 21
November 1997. This year we also celebrated our
sixth year since listing on the NZX. Since listing
we have more than doubled our size and we are
likely to double again in the next five years as we
continue to grow our footprint and as the ageing
population continues to increase. We continue to
assess potential entry into the Australian market.

sustainability is becoming increasingly important
in the way businesses operate. Summerset
already undertakes a range of activities
that contribute to social and environmental
sustainability. However, we recognise we are in
the early stages of our sustainability journey, and
plan to review our approach to this important area
over the coming year to improve our contribution.
Summerset will continue to work hard to deliver
high quality retirement living for its residents
and subsequent financial results that benefit our
investors, residents and staff.
On behalf of the Board, thank you for your
continued support.

The Board has declared a final dividend of NZ 7.1
cents per share. This is a total dividend payment
for 2017 of NZ 11 cents per share and represents
30% of underlying profit.
Looking ahead to 2018, social and environmental

Summerset is New Zealand’s fastest growing retirement
village and care operator, the second largest builder
of retirement units and third largest by number of
residents. We are also the youngest of all the large
operators. Summerset has come a long way in its
20 years, but we couldn’t have accomplished any of
these things without the dedication and support of our
people, both residents and staff.
Our aim is to provide the highest quality care

Chief
Executive
Officer’s
Report
In the mid 1990’s, Summerset’s founder, John O’Sullivan, went to visit
his grandmother who had moved into an old fashioned geriatric ward in
Waikanae. She was in what amounted to a dormitory for a number of people
with plastic curtains between the beds. John remembers stretching his arms
out and being able to touch all the “walls”.
In John’s words: “I started thinking. I knew there had
to be an opportunity for proper aged care, where
everyone has their own room and facilities. Our nanas
and grandads needed somewhere they could live with
dignity.” This was the start of Summerset.
In November last year we celebrated the 20th birthday
of our first village in Wanganui. It was wonderful to share
this experience with staff and residents in Wanganui
and across the country, and it certainly reinforced the
importance of our purpose: bringing the best of life to
our residents.
In our 20th anniversary year, we welcomed around
500 new residents and 200 staff to the Summerset
family. Summerset now has more than 4,700 residents

Pg 15

and more than 1,200 staff. That is a real achievement
for a company that started out with a single village
in Wanganui in 1997. I think we can fairly say that
Summerset has been a real New Zealand success story.
In 2017, Summerset recorded a number of
achievements including scoring record levels of
resident satisfaction, winning an award for our Levin
memory care centre, moving to the top quartile of
employers for staff engagement in New Zealand and
Australia, releasing a market leading range of staff
benefits, issuing the first retail bonds in the retirement
and aged care sector, building 450 new homes,
completing 682 occupation right sales (new sales and
resales), achieving a development margin of 27.3% and
recording an $81.7 million underlying profit, up 44% on

Our resident satisfaction results continue to perform
very strongly with village resident satisfaction last
year of 97%, up from 94% in 2016. Our care resident
satisfaction result was 97%, up from 94% in 2016. Over
the last two years we have focused on ensuring better
communications with residents and their families
through the year, faster resolution of issues, lifting
property standards and more presence from our head
office staff, including the Executive Leadership Team
and myself, on sites to ensure our service standards are
being met and any issues are resolved quickly.
For 2018 we have further initiatives aimed at continuing
to improve the village and care experience for residents.
From March 2018 three regionally based food providers,
White Tie Health Services, Kerr & Ladbrook and Cater
Plus, will provide food for our villages. There will also
be an in-house team at our Levin and Paraparaumu
villages. Food is an essential part of the offering in the
care business, but also in the village as well. Our focus
has been on finding local food providers for whom food
is a core competency and where the owners have a
personal connection, close contact with our residents
and really care about what they do. Using a number
of local providers also ensures our food will have local
variation suited to each region and season as opposed
to serving the same meal in all villages at the same time.
As Rob has already mentioned, we received the New
Zealand Aged Care Association best built environment
award for our first memory care centre in September.
We are particularly proud of this innovative model of
dementia care as we are the first in New Zealand to offer
apartment style living for people living with dementia.
The genesis of this was simple: there must be a better
way to care for people with dementia. We intend to
incorporate memory care centres in our new villages
and the next two will be ready towards the end of 2019
in Casebrook, Christchurch and Rototuna, Hamilton.
For the third year in a row, we also received a Highly
Commended award in the Aged Care and Retirement
Villages category of the annual Reader’s Digest Trusted
Brand awards.
We have previously flagged investments we are making
in systems, and in particular the resident management
system VCare. The roll-out of this system is progressing

well with the village modules largely in place across the
group. Through the course of 2018 we will look to roll
out the clinical modules of this system. This will take
what is currently a paper based management system
onto VCare. In the initial work for this care roll-out, we
can already see considerable opportunity in removing
duplication of effort, streamlining workflows and
increasing the visibility of how our sites are performing
to our regional and central operations and clinical teams
to ensure we are delivering quality care at all times.
Investing in our people
In October, we introduced a range of market leading
benefits to reward our staff for their contribution,
enhance our employee brand and improve staff
retention. For me this was an important move to
show staff how much we value them, in particular our
frontline staff, who are at the heart of our business.
These incentives are a further boost to the 1 July 2017
government funded pay increase for caregivers,
diversional and occupational therapists and cover
all Summerset permanent full or part time staff. The
benefits include:
• H
 ealth insurance covering everyday health care costs
such as GPs, dentists, physios and optometrists
• F
 uneral cover – $10,000 for every permanent
employee or their spouse
• L
 ong service leave – after five years’ service with
Summerset
• B
 uyers group trade discounts and Summerset
supplier discounts from a range of companies
We also continue to offer staff the opportunity to
participate in an all staff share scheme, with 83% of
employees signing up, an increase on 81% in 2016. The
scheme provides staff with $780 worth of shares that
vest after three years if they remain at Summerset.
These benefits have been very well received by staff
and place us as a leading provider in this area.
In 2017 we have worked to develop a new uniform range
for our staff. Our Katikati and Trentham village staff have
taken part in user trials and we are now refining the
designs before rolling out the range across all villages
in 2018.
Staff engagement is an important measure within any
business. This year we received an overall company
engagement score of 67%. This is 9% above the
average engagement score of 58% for New Zealand
and Australian companies and places Summerset in
the highest quartile of New Zealand and Australian
companies for staff engagement. This is a pleasing
result although we have ongoing work we want to do in
this area.
Health and safety continues to be an important area of
focus for Summerset. In the past 12 months, we have

Pg 16

moved further towards improving our systems. We
implemented a risk management framework across
the company; participated in two external health and
safety audits, which identified where we are making
good progress and how we can further enhance our
practices; achieved ACC accredited employer status;
employed a health and safety team member dedicated
to construction, and advanced relationships with other
companies in similar industries to progress industry
specific health and safety benchmarks. We continue to
achieve positive results with our Site Safe New Zealand
audits across our construction sites.
Bringing the Best of Life
In 2017, we also undertook a rebranding exercise. This
has resulted in an updated brand appearance, new
website and redesigned customer facing collateral
across our operations. Residents are at the heart of
what we do and we have tried to reflect this in our brand
imagery, the stories we tell in our website and collateral
and how our website functions, with a number of new
features designed to make understanding what we offer
and how to get in touch with us easier for residents
and their families. We have also been spending time
increasing our social media presence and would invite
you to visit our page on Facebook which can be found
by searching for Summerset. There are some great
stories on here about the life in our villages. We can
also be found on LinkedIn, which has a more businessfocused orientation.
As part of turning 20 years old in 2017, we have written
a book (available free by contacting our Wellington
office) which tells the story of Summerset, from John
O’Sullivan’s desire to build a place where he would be
proud to have his nana stay, through to where we are

today. Summerset was founded on John’s vision of
putting residents first, doing the right thing for people
and ensuring that we would all be proud to have our
own family in a Summerset village. As we have grown
we have found the ability to be able to articulate these
values clearly is important to staff, residents, families
and other stakeholders. To this end we have formalised
our values with our three overarching values of “strong
enough to care”, “one team” and “strive to be the best”
encapsulating the spirit of what is Summerset.
Growth and development
Auckland and Christchurch continue to be focus areas
of growth for Summerset.
In July 2017 we opened the main building of our
Ellerslie village, which is part of a $1.3 billion investment
programme in the region, including further villages in
St Johns and Parnell. The development of our Ellerslie
village represents another step forward in our Auckland
growth plans, which will strengthen our position as New
Zealand’s fastest growing retirement village and aged
care provider.
Summerset is playing a role in freeing up Auckland
property at a time when land supply in the city is under
pressure. The higher density nature of our Ellerslie
village means it is expected to free up the equivalent of
about 18 hectares of residential land in Auckland.
When complete, Summerset at Heritage Park will house
400 residents in a mix of two and three bedroom villas,
apartments, and serviced apartments, while 58 care
rooms will provide rest home and hospital-level care.
Summerset has also applied to Auckland Council for
resource consent to develop over 340 homes on 2.5
hectares on St Johns Road. Homes at the proposed

St Johns village will include two and three bedroom
villas and apartments, one bedroom serviced
apartments and high quality rest-home and hospital
care. The village will also include Summerset’s award
winning memory care centre concept.

Paul has been with Summerset for 17 years, overseeing
the development function integral to Summerset’s
success. It is very pleasing to have someone of Paul’s
experience and proven track record leading our
Australian activity.

Design planning for Summerset’s seventh Auckland
village in Cheshire Street, Parnell is also underway.

Aaron Smail, Summerset’s Senior Development
Manager, has been promoted to the GM Development
role.

Work on our Casebrook village in Christchurch is
progressing well with the first two and three bedroom
villas and townhouses available for residents to move
into next month. The village will offer our first memory
care centre in Christchurch.
Like other large developers in Auckland’s tight
construction market, Summerset has experienced
some delays to its Ellerslie build. However, despite
this, we delivered our targeted 2017 build rate of 450
retirement units. This is testament to the dedication
of Summerset’s in-house construction team. We
continue to watch the Auckland market closely given
the construction pressures and plateauing residential
housing market. We are seeing good interest in sites and
good sales rates. Our days to settle metric for new sales
in Auckland has not changed despite the changes in the
housing market, which is indicative of the needs based
demand we see for our villages, with an average age of
80 on entry.
In 2017, we purchased two new sites for development, in
the Christchurch suburb of Avonhead and Wellington’s
Kenepuru. An additional 2.1 hectares in Cavendish Road
was also purchased to provide for an additional 71 villas
at our Casebrook village.
Plans for our Boulcott, Lower Hutt village continue
to progress. During 2017 we received a plan change,
which rezoned the land to residential usage. We also
submitted our resource consent for the village and
will progress this through 2018. For various reasons,
consenting for this site is taking longer than desired but
are we making slow but sure progress.
These purchases bring the total number of Summerset
locations to 29 nationwide.

In the sales team we appointed Fay French as GM Sales
last year. Fay was previously one of Summerset’s Group
Sales Managers, responsible for our South Island and
developing villages.
Looking ahead
Our focus in the coming year will be to continue to
deliver high quality retirement village living by bringing
the best of life to our residents whether they are
living independently in our villages, need a little extra
assistance in our serviced apartments, or are living in
our care centres.
Our residents are why we are here and developing
further homes for future residents is a key part of our
business and its financial success, from which our
residents, staff and investors all benefit.
We will continue to look for opportunities to purchase
land for more retirement villages in New Zealand and
continue to investigate whether to move into the
Australian market.
I would like to thank our residents for choosing to live at
Summerset and creating our vibrant villages; our staff, in
particular our caregivers and nurses, for the hard work
they do bringing the best of life to our residents each
day; and our investors for supporting our business.

Julian Cook
Chief Executive Officer

At the end of 2017, Summerset’s total land bank
represented approximately 2,841 retirement units and
396 care beds. This is a total of around six years’ supply
based on our intended build programme for retirement
units in 2018 of around 450 retirement units.
Executive Team changes
Last year we announced we had started to look at
Australia as a potential market for Summerset. To further
this work we have appointed Paul Morris, currently GM
Development, as GM Development Australia and he will
be relocating to Australia in 2018.

Summerset’s vision is that all of our staff go home safe from harm each day.
Summerset believes that a fundamental part of being
able to achieve its purpose of Bringing the Best of Life
to our older generations is a safe and healthy workforce.
Summerset completed a full review of all Company
health and safety practices in 2014 in preparation for
the new Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. This led
to the creation of the health and safety system now in
place at Summerset, the implementation of a health and
safety system to report and process health and safety
incidents, and the recruitment of a dedicated health and
safety team.
Summerset has continued to advance health and safety
practices by establishing and evolving a strong National
Health and Safety Committee. As a demonstration of
the commitment to health and safety by the Executive
Team, the majority of the Executive sit as part of the
National Health and Safety Committee.
Summerset’s approach focuses on doing the right thing,
working together and continually raising the bar.

Summerset’s commitment and vision for health and
safety is confirmed in a one-page policy that can easily
be understood by all staff across the Company.

RIFR

LTIFR

LTIFR = lost time injury frequency rate, is calculated by
multiplying the total number of LTI’s (lost time injuries)
recorded in a 12 month period by 200,000 and then
dividing by the total number of hours worked, i.e. an LTIFR
of 4.0 means that there have been four LTI’s per 200,000
hours worked on average over a 12-month period.

RIFR = recordable injury frequency rate, is calculated by
multiplying the total number of MTI’s (medical treatment
injuries) and LTI’s (lost time injuries) recorded in a
12-month period by 200,000 and then dividing by the

Community Support
Summerset supports the wider community through sponsorships of
individuals and organisations, as well as a large number of local clubs
and groups that have direct relationships with our villages. In addition at a
national level we support the following organisations:

New Zealand Dementia Co-operative (NZDC)
An organisation that works to bring together people
with expertise in dementia to further how this country
deals with the challenge of dementia.
Eureka Trust
Set up in association with Sir Paul Callaghan to
encourage and develop young leaders within the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics
subject areas. Summerset sponsors the Ageing Well
category of the Eureka Award, which looks at advances
that harness science to sustain health and wellbeing
into the later years of life. Palmerston North Girls’ High
School student Maddison McQueen-Davies received
this award in September 2017 with her proposal to fix
cartilage and help osteoarthritis sufferers through the
use of a gel currently being developed and tested in
the United States.

Orokonui Ecosanctuary
A wildlife sanctuary whose vision is for a healthy,
self-sustaining ecosystem, free of all introduced
mammals and comprising indigenous species that
are appropriate to the Orokonui forest, where people
can enjoy a peaceful encounter with nature, and
from which they may take recreation, refreshment,
new knowledge, new skills and a new commitment
to conservation. In addition to the financial support
pledged by Summerset for the next three years to
the Orokonui Ecosanctuary in 2017, the residents of
Summerset Bishopscourt in Dunedin jumped on board
to volunteer their time and energy by giving practical
help and resources.

Wellington Free Ambulance
In 2017 we made a donation to support the important
services they provide to the Greater Wellington and
Wairarapa regions.

This standard will replace NZ IAS 17 – Leases. NZ IFRS 16 requires a lessee to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease
payments and a ‘right-of-use asset’ for virtually all lease contracts. The impact of this standard is not expected to be significant
for the Group as operating lease commitments are not a material amount for the Group ($12.8 million of operating lease
commitments relative to $769.3 million net assets as at 31 December 2017). The operating lease commitments disclosed will
be discounted and recorded as right-of-use assets with corresponding lease liabilities and will be adjusted for the Group’s
assessment at the inception of each lease of the likelihood of exercising any renewal options. NZ IFRS 16 is effective 1 January
2019.

In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The principal areas of judgement in
preparing these financial statements are described in the following notes:

Accounting policies
Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to the understanding of the financial
statements are provided throughout the accompanying notes.
The accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the periods presented in these financial
statements.
The Group adopted all mandatory new and amended NZ IFRS Standards and Interpretations. These new and amended NZ IFRS
Standards and Interpretations had a disclosure impact only on these financial statements. The Group chose to early adopt NZ
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments from 1 July 2017 prior to the issue of retail bonds by the Company in July 2017 and related hedging
transactions being entered into. Certain note disclosures in the financial statements have been updated as a result of the early
adoption. There was no material impact on transition.

Underlying profit

Underlying profit differs from NZ IFRS profit for the period. The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure to assist
readers in determining the realised and non-realised components of fair value movement of investment property and tax
expense in the Group’s income statement. The measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures to monitor
performance and make investment decisions. Underlying profit is an industry wide measure which the Group uses consistently
across reporting periods.
This statement presented is for the Group, prepared in accordance with the Basis of preparation: underlying profit described
below.

Basis of preparation: underlying profit
Underlying profit is determined by taking profit for the period determined under NZ IFRS, adjusted for the impact of the
following:
a) Less fair value movement of investment property: reversal of investment property valuation changes recorded in NZ
IFRS profit for the period, which comprise both realised and non-realised valuation movements. This is reversed and
replaced with realised development margin and realised resale gains during the period, effectively removing the unrealised
component of the fair value movement of investment property.
b) Add/(less) impairment/(reversal of impairment) of land and buildings: remove the impact of non-cash care centre valuation
changes recorded in NZ IFRS reported profit after tax. Care centres are valued at least every three years (most recently
valued as at 31 December 2017), with fair value gains flowing through to the revaluation reserve unless the gain offsets a
previous impairment to fair value that was recorded in NZ IFRS profit for the period. Where there is any impairment of a care
centre, or reversal of a previous impairment that impacts NZ IFRS profit for the period, this is eliminated for the purposes of
determining underlying profit.
c) Add realised gain on resales: add the realised gains across all resales of occupation rights during the period. The realised
gain for each resale is determined to be the difference between the licence price for the previous occupation right for a
retirement unit and the occupation right resold for that same retirement unit during the period. Realised resale gains are
a measure of the cash generated from increases in selling prices of occupation rights to incoming residents, less cash
amounts repaid to vacated residents for the repayment of the price of their refundable occupation right purchased in an
earlier period. Realised resale gains exclude deferred management fees and refurbishment costs.

	
Components of the cost of developing retirement units include directly attributable construction costs and a proportionate
share of the following costs:
• infrastructure costs
• land cost on the basis of the purchase price of the land
• interest during the build period
• head office costs directly related to the construction of retirement units
All costs above include non-recoverable GST.
	Development margin excludes the costs of developing common areas of the main building within the retirement village
(including a share of the proportionate costs listed above). This is because they are assets that support the sale of
occupation rights for not just the new sale but for all subsequent resales. It also excludes the costs of developing care
centres, which are treated as property, plant and equipment for accounting purposes. These costs are both excluded in
line with industry standard.
e) Add/(less) deferred tax expense/(credit): reversal of the impact of deferred taxation.
Underlying profit does not include any adjustments for abnormal items or fair value movements on financial instruments that
are included in NZ IFRS profit for the period.

3. Segment reporting
The Group operates in one industry, being the provision of integrated retirement villages in New Zealand. The services provided
across all of the Group’s villages are similar, as are the type of customer and the regulatory environment. On this basis, the
Group has one reportable segment, and the Group results are the same as the results of the reportable segment. All resource
allocation decisions across the Group are made to optimise the consolidated Group’s result.
The Ministry of Health is a significant customer of the Group, as the Group derives care fee revenue in respect of eligible
government subsidised aged care residents. Fees earned from the Ministry of Health for the year ended 31 December 2017
amounted to $25.0 million (2016: $20.4 million). No other customers individually contribute a significant proportion of the Group
revenue. All revenue is earned in New Zealand.

4. Revenue
Care fees and villages services income is recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Deferred management fees, which entitle residents to accommodation and the use of the community facilities within the
village, are recognised over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to
revenue. The expected periods of tenure, being based on historical Group averages, are estimated to be seven to eight years
for villas, five years for apartments and three years for serviced apartments and memory care apartments. Where the deferred
management fees over the contractual period exceeds the amortisation of the deferred management fee based on estimated
tenure, the amount is recorded as a liability (revenue in advance). Deferred management fees are recognised on a gross basis in
the receipts for residents’ loans section of the statement of cash flows.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

d) Add realised development margin: add realised development margin across all new sales of occupation rights during
the period, with the recognition point being the cash settlement. Realised development margin is the margin earned on
the first time sale of an occupation right following the development of a retirement unit. The margin for each new sale is
determined to be the licence price for the occupation right, less the cost of developing that retirement unit.

6. Net finance costs

Deferred tax expense is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent it
is probable it will be utilised. Temporary differences for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting
nor taxable profit, unless they arise from business combination, are not provided for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Borrowing costs are capitalised for property, plant and equipment (Note 9) and investment property (Note 11) if they are directly
attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the
activities to prepare the asset commence and expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing
costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.

8. Trade and other receivables

(c) Imputation credit account

Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Trade receivables are not significant on an
individual basis and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate, less an allowance for impairment. The allowance for doubtful debts is made up of expected credit losses based
on assessment of trade receivables debt at the individual level for impairment, plus an additional allowance on the remaining
balance for potential credit losses not yet identified. The expected credit losses allowance requirement on the remaining
balance has been set at 2%. There has been no material change in the allowance for doubtful debts from prior year.

There were no imputation credits received or paid during the year and the balance at 31 December 2017 is nil (2016: nil).

9. Property, plant and equipment

Subsequent to initial recognition, land and buildings related to care centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is
the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on buildings and accumulated
impairment losses, if any, since the assets were last revalued. Other plant and equipment is subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Where an item of plant and equipment is disposed of, the gain or loss
recognised in the income statement is calculated as the difference between the net sales price and the carrying amount
of the asset.
Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence, which is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged
between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction as at the valuation
date.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same
asset previously recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement unless
it directly offsets a previous surplus in the same asset in other comprehensive income. Any accumulated depreciation at
revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued
amount of the asset. Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained
earnings. Independent valuations are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ
materially from the asset’s fair value at the balance sheet date.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line (SL) or diminishing value (DV) basis over the estimated useful
life of each item of property, plant and equipment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. Depreciation methods,
useful lives and residual values are reassessed at the reporting date. Major depreciation rates are as follows:
Buildings (2% DV or SL)

Furniture and fittings (8% to 40% DV or SL)

Motor vehicles (20% to 31% DV or SL)

Revaluations
An independent valuation to determine the fair value of all completed care centres which are classified as land and buildings
was carried out as at 31 December 2017 by CBRE Limited, an independent registered valuer. Valuations are carried out every
three years unless there are indicators of a significant change in fair value. CBRE determine the fair value of all care centre
assets using an earnings-based multiple approach. Significant assumptions used in the most recent valuation include market
value per care bed of between $68,000 and $173,000 and individual unit earning capitalisation rate of between
12.0% and 15.0%.
As the fair value of land and buildings is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised property,
plant and equipment as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolios of land and buildings are the capitalisation rates applied to individual unit earnings and the market value
per care bed. A significant decrease (increase) in the capitalisation rate would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value
measurement and a significant increase (decrease) in the market value per care bed would result in a significantly higher (lower)
fair value measurement.

Intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses. Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a diminishing value or straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use. The intangible assets are software. The major

11. Investment property
Investment property is held to earn current and future rental income. It comprises land and buildings and associated equipment
and furnishings relating to independent living units, serviced and memory care apartments and common facilities in the
retirement village. Investment property includes buildings under development. Initial recognition of investment property is at
cost and it is subsequently measured at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in the income statement.

The Group has deemed it is unable to reliably determine the fair value of non-land retirement villages under development at
31 December 2017 and therefore these are carried at cost. This equates to $171.5 million of investment property (2016: $122.3
million).
The fair value of investment property as at 31 December 2017 was determined by CBRE Limited, an independent registered
valuer. The fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on a semi-annual basis, based on market values, being
the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing buyer and a
willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently
and without compulsion. To assess the fair value of the Group’s interest in the village, CBRE has undertaken a cash flow analysis
to derive a net present value. There has been no change in valuation technique since the previous period.
Significant assumptions used by the valuer include a discount rate of between 13.5% and 16.0% (2016: 13.75% to 16.0%) and a
long term nominal house price inflation rate of between 0% and 3.5% (2016: 0% to 3.5%). Other assumptions used by the valuer
include the average entry age of residents and occupancy periods of retirement units.

Land acquired with the intention of constructing investment property on it is classified as investment property from the date of
acquisition.

As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised
investment property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Rental income from investment property, being deferred management fees, is accounted for as described in Note 4.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy

Depreciation is not charged on investment property.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolios of investment property are the discount rate, the long-term nominal house price inflation rate, the average
entry age of residents and the occupancy period of retirement units. A significant decrease (increase) in the discount rate or
the occupancy period of retirement units would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement and a significant
increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents or the long-term nominal house price inflation rate would result in a
significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

Operating expenses
Direct operating expenses arising from investment property that generated rental income during the period amounted to $26.1
million (2016: $21.9 million). There were nine retirement units excluding work in progress (2016: eight) in investment property
that did not generate rental income during the period.

Security

Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest
at variable rates and to pay interest at fixed rates. At 31 December 2017, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place
with a total notional principal amount of $319 million (2016: $251 million). Of the swaps in place, at 31 December 2017 $219
million (2016: $179 million) are being used to cover approximately 89% (2016: 65%) of the bank loans and retail bonds principal
outstanding. These agreements effectively change the Group’s interest exposure on the principal covered by the interest rate
swaps from a floating rate to fixed rates, which range between 2.78% and 4.47% (2016: 3.54% and 4.47%).

At 31 December 2017, all investment property relating to registered retirement villages under the Retirement Villages Act
2003 are subject to a registered first mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor to secure the Group’s obligations to the
occupation right agreement holders.

The fair value of these agreements at 31 December 2017 is a $7.9 million liability, comprised of $7.9 million of swap liabilities and
$0.0 million of swap assets (2016: liability of $4.9 million, comprised of $5.8 million of swap liabilities and $0.9 million of swap
assets). Of this, a liability of $333,000 (2016: $264,000) is estimated to be current. The agreements cover notional amounts for
a term of between one and ten years.

12. Trade and other payables

Fair value hedges

Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost. Due to their short-term nature they are not discounted.

The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to $100 million of retail bonds issued
by the Group in July 2017. The hedge is for the future fair value movements in the retail bonds as a result of market interest rate
movements. The Group has designated all of its $100 million retail bonds in fair value hedge relationships.

13. Employee benefits

Both the hedging instrument (interest rate swap) and the hedged risk are recognised at fair value. The change in the fair value
of both items offset in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent the hedging relationship is effective. The increase
in fair value of the interest rate swaps of $1.2 million (2016: nil) has been recognised in finance costs and has been offset with a
similar fair value loss on the retail bonds to leave an ineffective amount in finance costs of $22,000 (2016: nil).
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
fixed rates and to pay interest at floating rates. At 31 December 2017, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with
a total notional principal amount of $100 million (2016: nil). Of the interest rate swaps in place, at 31 December 2017 $100 million
(2016: nil) are being used to cover 100% of the fixed interest rate retail bonds outstanding.
The notional principal amounts and the period of expiry of the interest rate swap contracts are as follows:

A provision is made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages, salaries, annual leave and short-term incentives
when it is probable that settlement will be required and the amount can be estimated reliably.

14. Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swaps are initially
recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value on each reporting
date. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined based on cash flows discounted to present value using current
market interest rates.

Cash flow hedges

*includes $100 million of receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps

The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to the secured bank loans. These
interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. When interest rate swaps meet the criteria for cash flow hedge
accounting, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income,
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to reserves are transferred out of reserves
and included in the measurement of the hedged transaction when the forecast transaction occurs. When interest rate swaps do
not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, all movements in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in
the income statement.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
15. Residents’ loans
An occupation right agreement confers a right of occupancy to a villa, apartment, serviced apartment or memory care
apartment. The consideration received on the grant of an occupation right agreement is allocated to the resident’s loan in
full. Residents’ loans are amounts payable under occupation right agreements. These loans are non-interest-bearing and
are payable when both an occupation right agreement is terminated and there has been settlement of a new occupation
right agreement for the same retirement unit and the proceeds from the new settlement have been received by the Group.
Residents’ loans are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group holds a contractual right to set-off the deferred management fee receivable on termination of an agreement against
the resident’s loan to be repaid. Residents’ loans are therefore recognised net of the deferred management fee receivable
on the balance sheet. Deferred management fees are payable by residents in consideration for the supply of accommodation
and the right to share in the use of community facilities. Deferred management fees are paid in arrears with the amount
payable calculated as a percentage of the resident’s loan amount as per the resident’s occupation right agreement. Deferred
management fee receivable is calculated and recorded based on the current tenure of the resident and the contractual right
to deferred management fee earned at balance date. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on recognition of deferred management
fee revenue.

16. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings include secured bank loans and unsubordinated fixed rate retail bonds.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the borrowings are measured at amortised cost with any difference between the initial
recognised amount and the redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing using
the effective interest rate. The retail bonds are designated in fair value hedge relationships, which means that any change in
market interest rates result in a change in the fair value adjustment on that debt. Retail bonds and bank issue expenses,
fees and other costs incurred in arranging finance are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant debt instrument
or debt facility.

The weighted average interest rate for the year to 31 December 2017 was 3.57% (2016: 3.58%). This includes the impact of
interest rate swaps (see Note 14).
The secured bank loan facility at 31 December 2017 has a maximum of $500.0 million (2016: $450.0 million). Lending of $285.0
million expires in August 2020 and $215.0 million of lending expires in March 2022.
The retail bonds were issued for $100.0 million and have a maturity date of 11 July 2023. The retail bonds are listed on the NZX
Debt Market (NZDX) with the ID SUM010.

Security
The banks loans and retail bonds rank equally with the Group’s other unsubordinated obligations and are secured by the
following securities held by a security trustee:
• a
 first ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by
guaranteeing Group members that are not registered retirement villages;
• a
 second ranking registered mortgage over the land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease)
by each registered retirement village that is a guaranteeing Group member (behind a first ranking registered mortgage in
favour of the Statutory Supervisor); and
• t he General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the guaranteeing Group members, but in respect of which the
Statutory Supervisor has first rights to the proceeds of security enforcement against all assets of the registered retirement
villages to which the security trustee is entitled.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
17. Financial instruments

Interest rate risk

Exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board reviews and agrees
on policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below. The Group has no exposure to foreign currency or any other
substantial market price risk.

Categories of financial instruments
Financial assets
All financial assets of the Group are classified at amortised cost except for interest rate swaps which are classified as fair value
through profit and loss.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities except interest rate swaps and retail bonds are classified as liabilities at amortised cost. Refer to note 16 for
detail on the retail bonds.

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a resident or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their
contractual obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk relates to receivables from residents and bank balances. The Group
manages its exposure to credit risk. The Group’s cash is held with its principal banker, with the level of exposure to credit risk
considered minimal with low levels of cash generally held. Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and funds
are placed with high-credit quality financial institutions. The level of risk associated with sundry debtors is considered minimal.
The Group does not require collateral from its debtors and the Directors consider the Group’s exposure to any concentration of
credit risk to be minimal.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The status of trade receivables is as
follows:

Impairment

All amounts past due but not impaired have been reviewed and are considered recoverable.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on
risk.

Pg 53

In these hedge relationships the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
• a
 significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship;

• d
 ifferences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.
Other than these sources, due to the alignment of the hedged risk in the hedged item and hedged instrument, hedge
ineffectiveness is not expected to arise.
At 31 December 2017 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the
Group’s profit before income tax by $3.4 million (2016: decrease by $2.6 million) and decrease total comprehensive income by
approximately $0.2 million (2016: decrease by $0.9 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages
liquidity by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash
flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk on residents’ loans
and related sundry debtors through the contractual requirements of occupation rights agreements, whereby a resident’s loan is
only repaid on receipt of the loan monies from the incoming resident.
The following table sets out the contractual cash flows for all financial liabilities for the Group (including contractual interest
obligations on bank loans):

To comply with the Group’s risk management policy, the hedge ratio is based on the interest rate swap notional amount to
hedge the same notional amount of bank loans or retail bonds. This results in a hedge ratio of 1:1. This is the same as used for
actual risk management purposes, and such a ratio is appropriate for purposes of hedge accounting as it does not result in an
imbalance that would create hedge ineffectiveness.

• w
 here the hedge instrument has been transacted on a date different to the rate set date of the bank loan or retail bonds,
interest rates could differ; and

Credit risk

Not past due

The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by seeking to obtain the most competitive rate of interest at all times. The
Group has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to provide an effective cash flow hedge against the variability in
floating interest rates. The Group has also entered into other interest swap agreements to reduce interest rate repricing risk in
relation to retail bonds. See Note 14 for details of interest rate swap agreements.

Residents’ loans are non-interest bearing and are not required to be repaid following termination of an occupation right
agreement until receipt of cash for the new resident loan from the incoming resident. The figures above have been calculated
using best estimates of resident loan repayments based on historical information. To date, cash for new residents’ loans
received has always exceeded cash to repay residents’ loans, net of deferred management fees.

The fair value of residents’ loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Future cash flows are based on the
assumption that the average tenure periods are those disclosed above and have been discounted at 14% (2016: 14%). The fair
value of residents’ loans is categorised as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value
Measurement.
The fair value of retail bonds is based on the price traded at on the market as at 31 December 2017. The fair value of the retail
bonds is categorised as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined using inputs from third parties that are observable, either directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Based on this, the Company and Group has categorised these financial
instruments as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Capital management
The Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings. The objective of the Group’s capital management
is to ensure a strong credit position to support business growth and maximise shareholder value. The Group is subject to
capital requirements imposed by the bank lenders (through covenants in the Syndicated Facility Agreement) and bond holders
(through covenants in the Master Trust Deed). The Group has met all of these externally imposed capital requirements for the
year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: all requirements met). The Group capital structure is managed, and adjustments are made,
with Board approval. There were no changes to objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2017
(2016: none).

The total shares on issue at 31 December 2017 of 223,968,019 for the Company differs from the share capital for the Group due
to shares held in 100% owned subsidiary, Summerset LTI Trustee Limited. As at 31 December 2017, 4,227,907 shares are held
by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited for employee share plans which are eliminated on consolidation. Refer to Note 20 for further
details on employee share plans.

Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve is used to record the revaluation of care centre land and buildings.

Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record gains or losses on instruments used as cash flow hedges. The amounts are recognised in
profit and loss when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.

Dividends
On 22 March 2017 a dividend of 5.1 cents per ordinary share was paid to shareholders and on 11 September 2017 a dividend of
3.9 cents per ordinary share was paid to shareholders. (2016: on 24 March 2016 a dividend of 3.4 cents per ordinary share was
paid to shareholders and on 9 September 2016 a dividend of 2.6 cents per ordinary share was paid to shareholders).
A dividend reinvestment plan applied to the dividends paid. 687,184 ordinary shares were issued in relation to the plan for the
March 2017 dividend and 593,876 ordinary shares were issued in relation to the plan for the September 2017 dividend.
(2016: 557,924 ordinary shares were issued in March 2016 and 333,618 ordinary shares were issued in September 2016).

Employee share plans

Senior employee share plan

While there is a requirement to remain employed by Summerset up to vesting date, there are no performance hurdles for grants
of shares to senior management team members, other than the members of the Executive Team whose performance hurdles
are described above.
590,831 shares were vested and eligible for exercise at 31 December 2017 (2016: 750,000). The exercise prices range from
$2.68 to $3.47 (2016: $1.40). An additional 657,661 shares were vested on 31 December 2017 but are not eligible for exercise until
23 February 2018.
The share plans are equity-settled schemes and are measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at
the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate
that the shares will vest. These options were valued using the Black Scholes valuation model and the option cost for the year
ending 31 December 2017 of $711,000 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the Group for that
period (2016: $490,000).

The Group operates employee share plans for selected senior employees (“Participants”) to purchase shares in the Company.
The shares for the plans are held by a nominee as share options on behalf of Participants, until such time after the vesting of
shares that the nominee is directed by the Participant they wish to exercise the share option, or the shares are sold or cancelled
by the nominee if vesting criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as all other ordinary shares.
The Group has provided Participants with interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the acquisition of the shares for these
plans. These loans are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited and eliminate on consolidation.
The issue price of shares under the 2013 share plan is determined from the volume weighted average price on the NZX during
the ten trading days prior to issue.

Independent auditor’s report to the Shareholders of Summerset Group
Holdings Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Summerset Group Holdings Limited (“the company”) and its
subsidiaries (together “the Group”) on pages 30 to 60, which comprise the statement of financial position of the Group as
at 31 December 2017, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and
statement of cash flows for the year then ended of the Group, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements including
a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 30 to 60 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2017 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting
Standards.
This report is made solely to the company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to
the company’s shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (revised) Code of Ethics for Assurance
Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Ernst & Young provided aged care market analysis services to the Group and assurance services in relation to the audit of
underlying profit disclosures. We have no other relationship with, or interests in, the Group. Partners and employees of our firm
may deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on
these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section
of the audit report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures
designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit
procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of Investment Properties
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Summerset’s retirement village assets (excluding care
facilities, but including development land) are recorded as
Investment Property and account for 93% of total assets.

Our work focused on understanding the overall valuation
methodology for compliance with NZ IFRS 13 Fair Value
Measurement and evaluating significant inputs. In obtaining
sufficient audit evidence, we:

Investment Properties are carried at fair value. The Group
engages an independent registered valuer to determine the
fair value of investment properties at balance date.
The valuation requires the use of judgement specific to
each of the properties. Significant input assumptions used
in the valuation are subjective and are not observable
through available market information. These assumptions
are the discount rate and the forecast long-term nominal
house price inflation. The valuation approach and significant
assumptions are described in Note 11 Investment Property to
the consolidated financial statements.
Investment properties are recorded at the value determined
by the valuer, adjusted for gross residents’ loans and deferred
management fees receivable which are recognised separately
on the statement of financial position but reflected in the cash
flow model to determine each village’s valuation.

Summerset records work in progress at cost, as it has
determined it is unable to measure the fair value of
construction whilst in progress. Work in progress does not
include land, which is classified as investment property from
the time of acquisition. Work in progress representing 8%
of total assets, was included in the balance of Investment

consolidated financial statements.

Our work on capitalised development costs focused on

attributable costs, including allocations of head office costs
and capitalised interest to individual stages of village related
projects. In obtaining sufficient audit evidence for each
component we:

Capitalised costs are allocated to individual building units from
a cost pool. Incurred costs generally relate to a number of
units and therefore the allocation requires judgement based
on number and relative size of units. The allocation of costs

Deferred management fee revenue is 32% of Summerset’s
total revenue. Summerset recognises deferred management
fee revenue from residents over the longer of the expected
period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue in
accordance with the terms of the resident’s occupational
right agreement.

methodology and testing the integrity of inputs and key

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The directors of the company are responsible for the Annual Report, which includes information other than the consolidated
financial statements and auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our
knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based upon the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The directors are responsible, on behalf of the entity, for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International
Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing on behalf of the entity the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. A further description of the auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the External Reporting Board’s website: https://www.xrb.

Governance
Summerset is committed to following best-practice governance structures and principles and to having good governance of
the way in which the Company operates. It also takes account of the Company’s listings on both the NZX and ASX.

• G
 ifts, entertainment and inducements – This policy governs the acceptance and reporting of benefits given to staff by
third parties.
• I nterests Register – In accordance with the Companies Act 1993 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, the
Company maintains an Interests Register in which all relevant transactions and matters involving the Directors are recorded.

Summerset has adopted the principles below as an appropriate way to demonstrate its commitment to these fundamental
principles and to illustrate the transparency of the Company’s approach to corporate governance for the benefit of its
Shareholders and other stakeholders. These principles are from the NZX Corporate Governance Code (NZX Code) issued in
May 2017. Each principle of the NZX Code is provided below with explanation on how Summerset meets each principle.

The Code of Ethics Policy can be found on the Company’s website and internal intranet, and a copy is provided to all new staff
(including contractors).

As at 31 December 2017, Summerset was in full compliance with the NZX Code, with the exception of recommendations 3.6
and 4.3.

Principle 2: Board Composition and Performance

The Board has adopted formal takeover protocols that address the matters recommended in recommendation 3.6 and as at
the date of this report is in full compliance with this recommendation. As the formal adoption of takeover protocols occurred
after the Company’s balance date, it is noted the Company did not comply with recommendation 3.6 during the year ended 31
December 2017. However, the Board has experience in these matters and its Code of Ethics addresses conflicts of interest, and
the adoption of takeover protocols formalises practices that were in place during the year ended 31 December 2017.

“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”

The Company has partially complied with recommendation 4.3, as it believes its financial reporting is balanced, clear and
objective and it has also included additional non-financial reporting in its Annual Report this year. However, the Company has
not provided all of the non-financial reporting disclosures recommended in recommendation 4.3, in part because the NZX
Code was issued part way through the year ended 31 December 2017. The Company notes it is in the early stages of developing
its reporting on non-financial matters, and intends to work towards full compliance in this area over the coming financial year.
Summerset’s Board and Committee Charters, and a number of the policies and guidelines referred to in this section, are
available to view at www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/governance-documents/

Principle 1: Code Of Ethical Behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these
standards being followed throughout the organisation.”

Ethical standards
The Board maintains high standards of ethical conduct and expects the Company’s employees to act legally and with integrity
in a manner consistent with the policies, guiding principles and values that are in place. These include the following:
• C
 ode of Ethics – This guide sets out the basic principles of legal and ethical conduct expected of all employees and
Directors. The Company encourages open and honest communication by staff about any current or potential problem,
complaint, suggestion, concern or question.
• S
 ecurities trading – In accordance with the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, the NZX Listing Rules, and the Financial
Markets Conduct Act 2013, Directors and employees of the Company are subject to limitations on their ability to buy or sell
Company shares.
• D
 iversity and inclusion – This policy outlines the Company’s guiding principles for diversity and inclusion. Refer to
Principle 2 for further details.
• C
 ode of Conduct – This policy sets out the expected behaviours while in employment with the Company. Company
employees are expected to act honestly, conscientiously, reasonably and in good faith while at all times having regard to
their responsibilities, the interests of Summerset and the welfare of our residents and employees’ colleagues.
• W
 histle blowing – This policy encourages employees to come forward if they have concerns regarding serious
wrongdoing, and ensures that employees have access to a confidential process in which they can report any issues in
relation to serious wrongdoing without fear of reprisal or victimisation.
• C
 onflicts of interest – This policy outlines the standards of integrity, professionalism and confidentiality to which all
employees and Directors of the Company must adhere with respect to their work and behaviour. To maintain integrity in
decision-making, each Director must advise the Board of any potential conflict of interest if such arises. If a significant
conflict of interest exists, the Director concerned will have no involvement in the decision-making process relating to the
matter.

Pg 67

Role of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is elected by Shareholders, and has responsibility for taking appropriate steps to protect and enhance
the value of the assets of the Company in the best interests of its Shareholders. The Board has adopted a formal Board Charter
detailing its authority, responsibilities, membership and operation.
The key responsibilities of the Board include setting the overall direction and strategy of the Company, establishing appropriate
policies and monitoring performance of management. The Board appoints the Chief Executive Officer and delegates the dayto-day operating of the business to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer implements policies and strategies
set by the Board and is accountable to it. The Board also has responsibility for ensuring the Company’s financial position is
sound, financial statements comply with generally accepted accounting practice and that the Company adheres to high
standards of ethical and corporate behaviour.
A summary of the Board mandate is as follows:
• At least two, or, if there are eight or more Directors, three or one-third of the total number of Directors should be
Independent as defined in the NZX Listing Rules;
• T
 he Chair of the Board should be a non-executive Director;
• T
 he Chair and the Chief Executive Officer should be different people;
• D
 irectors should possess a broad range of skills, qualifications and experience, and remain current on how best to perform
their duties as Directors;
• Information of sufficient content, quality and timeliness as the Board considers necessary shall be provided by
management to allow the Board to discharge its duties effectively;
• T
 he effectiveness and performance of the Board and its individual members should be re-evaluated on an annual basis.
Directors receive an induction upon appointment to the Board to ensure their full knowledge of the Company and the industry
in which it operates. The Directors are expected to keep themselves abreast of changes and trends in the business and to keep
themselves up to date to ensure they best perform their duties as Directors of the Company.
All Directors have been issued letters setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment.

Delegation of authority
The Board delegates to the Chief Executive Officer responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy and for managing the
Company’s operations. The Chief Executive Officer has Board-approved levels of authority and, in turn, sub-delegates authority
in some cases to direct reports, and has established a formal process for direct reports to sub-delegate certain authorities as
appropriate. This is documented in the Delegation and Powers Reserved to the Board Policy.

Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution and the NZX Listing Rules, one third of the Directors are required to retire by
rotation and may offer themselves for re-election by Shareholders each year. Procedures for the appointment and removal
of Directors are also governed by the Constitution. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee identifies and nominates
candidates to fill Director vacancies for Board approval.

Pg 68

Board composition
The Company’s Constitution prescribes that the Board shall be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, with at least two
Directors ordinarily resident in New Zealand. The Board currently comprises six non-executive Independent Directors. In
determining whether a Director is Independent the Board has regard to the NZX Listing Rules.

As at 31 December 2017 (and 31 December 2016 for the prior comparative period), the mix of gender of those employed
by the Company is set out below:
Gender

As at 31 December 2017, the non-executive Independent Directors were Rob Campbell (Chair), Dr Andrew Wong, Anne Urlwin,
Gráinne Troute, James Ogden and Dr Marie Bismark.

Directors

More information on the Directors, including their interests, qualifications and security holdings, is provided in the Directors’
Profiles and Disclosures sections of this report.

Total

The Board holds regular scheduled meetings. The Directors generally receive material for Board meetings five working days in
advance, except in the case of special meetings for which the time period may be shorter owing to the urgency of the matter to
be considered.
All Directors have access to the Executive Team to discuss issues or obtain information on specific areas in relation to items
to be considered at Board meetings or other areas as considered appropriate. Key Executives and managers are invited to
attend and participate in appropriate sessions at Board meetings. Directors have unrestricted access to Company records and
information.
Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice relating to the affairs of the Company or other responsibilities.
Prior approval of the Chair is required before seeking such advice and Directors are expected to ensure that the cost of such
advice is reasonable.

Diversity and inclusion
The Company and its Board are committed to a workplace culture that promotes and values diversity and inclusiveness. This is
outlined in the Company’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy which is available on the Company’s website.
Diversity is defined as the characteristics that make one individual different from another. Diversity encompasses gender, race,
ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, physical capability, family responsibilities, education, cultural background and more.
Inclusion is defined as a sense of belonging, respecting and valuing all individuals, providing fair access to opportunity, and
removing discrimination and other barriers to involvement. The Board recognises that inclusion leads to a better experience of
work for Summerset’s employees, makes teams stronger, leads to greater creativity and performance, contributes to a more
meaningful relationship with residents, their families and stakeholders, and ultimately increases value to Shareholders.
The Board believes that diversity across the workforce makes Summerset stronger and better able to connect with, and
bring the best of life to residents on a day-to-day basis. When there is a variety of thinking styles, backgrounds, experiences,
perspectives and abilities, employees are more able to understand residents’ needs and to respond effectively to them.
Each year the Board reviews performance against agreed annual objectives.

Officers of the Company are the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
The Executive Team is defined as the Executive management team (including the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer).
These figures include permanent full-time, permanent part-time, fixed-term and casual employees, but not independent
contractors.

Board performance
The Board undertakes an annual self-assessment of its performance and its processes and procedures.

Executive Team performance
The Board evaluates annually the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer reviews the
performance of direct reports and reports to the Board on those reviews. The evaluation is based on criteria that include the
performance of the business and the accomplishment of longer-term strategic objectives. It may include quantitative and
qualitative measures. During the most recent financial year, performance evaluations were conducted in accordance with this
process.

The objectives of the policy in place during 2017 were to report on female representation at the Board, Executive and senior
leadership level, and to increase Summerset’s ability to report on a wider set of diversity metrics. The Board considers that for
the year ended 31 December 2017, the objectives of the policy have been met.

Principle 3: Board Committees

The Board reviewed the Diversity and Inclusion Policy in December 2017, and the Objectives of the current policy are to:

“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board
responsibility.”

opportunity;

for progression and promotion on the basis of performance.

Board committees
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Clinical
Governance Committee and the Development and Construction Committee. Each committee operates under a charter
approved by the Board, and any recommendations they make are recommendations to the Board. The charter for each
committee is reviewed annually. All Directors are entitled to attend committee meetings.

Principle 4: Reporting and Disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate
disclosures.”

Making timely and balanced disclosure
The Company is committed to promoting Shareholder confidence through open, timely and accurate market communication.
The Company has in place procedures designed to ensure compliance with its disclosure obligations under the NZX and ASX
Listing Rules. The Company’s Market Disclosure and Communications Policy sets out the responsibilities of the Board and
management in disclosure and communication and procedures for managing this obligation.
Copies of key governance documents, including the Code of Ethics, Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines, Board and
Committee Charters, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Director and Executive Remuneration Policy, and Market Disclosure and
Communications Policy are all available on the Company’s website at www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/governancedocuments/.
Some non-financial disclosures, such as the Company’s approach to health and safety, are included within this Annual Report.
The Company recognises it is in the early stages of reporting on non-financial information, and intends to increase future
disclosure in this area.

Principle 5: Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”
Remuneration of Directors and the Executive Team is reviewed by the Board’s Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
Its membership and role are set out under Principle 3 above. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on
remuneration packages, keeping in mind the requirements of the Board and Executive Remuneration Policy.
The level of remuneration paid to the Directors and the Executive Team will be determined by the Board. However, Directors’
fees must be within the limits approved by the Shareholders of the Company.

KPMG was appointed in the role of internal auditor of the Company in December 2016, and its role is governed by the Internal
Audit Charter.
The primary objective of internal audit is to increase the strength of the Company’s control environment. This is guided by a
philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Company. It assists the Company in accomplishing its objectives
by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of its governance, risk
management and internal controls.
The scope of the internal audit programme is set by the Audit Committee.

Principle 8: Shareholder Rights and Relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage
them to engage with the issuer.”

Respecting the rights of Shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that its Shareholders understand its activities by communicating effectively with them and giving
them ready access to clear and balanced information about the Company.
To assist with this, the Company’s website is maintained with relevant information, including copies of presentations and
reports. The Company’s key corporate governance policies are also included on the website.
The Company’s major communications with Shareholders during the financial year include its annual and half-year reports and
the annual meeting of Shareholders. The annual and half-year reports are available in electronic and hard-copy format.
Shareholders have the right to vote on major decisions as required by the NZX Listing Rules.
The Notice of Meeting is sent to Shareholders and published on the Company’s website at least 28 days prior to the annual
Shareholders’ meeting each year.

Further details on remuneration are provided in the Remuneration section of this Annual Report.

Principle 6: Risk Management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The Board
should regularly verify that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”

Recognising and managing risk
The Company has a risk management framework for identifying, overseeing, managing and controlling risk. The processes
involved require the maintenance of a risk register that identifies key business risks and initiatives deployed to manage and
mitigate those risks.
The Board has responsibility for the oversight of Summerset’s risk management programme. Its responsibilities in this regard are
set out in the Board Charter.
The Company’s senior management maintain a risk register and this is updated regularly.
Information on the Company’s approach to health and safety is included within this Annual Report.

Principle 7: Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”
The Board’s relationship with its auditors, both external and internal, is governed by the Audit Committee Charter, Audit
Independence Policy and the Internal Audit Charter. These charters and policies set out the types of engagements that can be
performed by the external and internal auditors.
The external auditor (Ernst & Young) attends the Company’s annual shareholders’ meeting, and is available to answer questions
from Shareholders in relation to the external audit.
External audit work for the Group was tendered during 2017, with Ernst & Young remaining in this role.

The Board is assisted in delivering its responsibilities and objectives for Executive remuneration by the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee. The role and membership of this Committee is set out in the Statement of Corporate Governance.
Summerset’s remuneration policy for members of the Executive Team provides the opportunity for them to receive, where
performance merits, a total remuneration package in the upper quartile for equivalent market-matched roles. The Nomination
and Remuneration Committee reviews the annual performance appraisal outcomes for all Executive Team members, including
the Chief Executive Officer. The review takes into account external benchmarking to ensure competitiveness with comparable
market peers, along with consideration of an individual’s performance, skills, expertise and experience.
Total remuneration is made up of three components: fixed remuneration, short-term performance-based cash remuneration
and long-term performance-based equity remuneration.

Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of base salary and benefits. Summerset’s policy is to pay fixed remuneration with reference to the
fixed pay market median.

Short-term incentives
Short-term incentives (STIs) are at-risk payments designed to motivate and reward for performance, typically in that financial
year. The target value of an STI payment is set annually, usually as a percentage of the executive’s base salary. For 2017, the
relevant percentages were 25% to 50%.
A proportion (80% for the Chief Executive Officer, 70% for other Executive Team members) of the STI is related to achievement
of annual performance metrics which aim to align executives to a shared set of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on
business priorities for the next 12 months. Target areas for the shared KPIs for 2017 are outlined below:

*** Dr Andrew Wong was appointed as a Director on 1 March 2017.

Target

**** Fees for being on the Due Diligence Committee in relation to the issue of retail bonds in July 2017.

Directors’ fees are reviewed from time to time. The maximum aggregate amount of remuneration payable by Summerset to
Directors (in their capacity as Directors) was set at $650,000 per annum in April 2017 for the non-executive Directors. This was
an increase of $50,000 from the previous amount of remuneration payable, which was set in April 2014, and follows an increase
in the number of Directors to six. Current annualised Directors’ fees are $602,500, inclusive of additional remuneration for
committee Chairs.
As at 31 December 2017, the standard Director fees per annum are as follows:

No additional fees are paid to committee members.
Directors’ fees exclude GST, where appropriate. Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for costs directly associated with
carrying out their duties, including travel costs.
Directors and Officers also have the benefit of Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. Cover is for damages, judgements,
fines, penalties, legal costs awarded and defence costs arising from wrongful acts committed while acting for Summerset.
There are some exclusions within the policy. The insurance cover is supplemented by the provision of Director and Officer
indemnities from the Company, but this does not extend to criminal acts.

There are three performance levels within each target area – gate-opener, on-target and maximum performance – with 100% of
the amount allocated to that target area being payable when the on-target level is achieved. The maximum performance levels
allow employees to be rewarded for performance above target levels. The maximum amount of an STI payment for an Executive
Team member is 112% of the STI on-target amount for that Executive Team member.
The balance of the STI is related to individual performance measures.
In the event that gate-opener underlying EBITDA performance against budget is not achieved, no STI payment will be made.

Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives (LTIs) are at-risk payments through a share plan, designed to align the reward of Executive Team members
with the enhancement of shareholder value over a multi-year period.
Under the LTI, Executive Team members are able to purchase shares in Summerset Group Holdings Limited. The shares for
the plans are held by a nominee on behalf of the Executive Team members until such time after the vesting of shares that the
nominee is directed by the Executive Team member to transfer or sell the shares, or the shares are sold or cancelled by the
nominee if vesting criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as all other ordinary shares.
The Group has provided Executive Team members participating in the LTI with interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the
acquisition of the shares for these plans. These loans must be repaid in full before shares are transferred to Executives from the
nominee.

Pg 76

An LTI plan commenced on 1 November 2011, upon the Company listing on the NZX Main Board, under which grants were made
to Executive Team members. Vesting of shares was contingent on achievement of certain profitability levels in the business.
The vesting criteria were achieved and all shares vested. This plan has now closed, with final vesting occurring in December
2013. Loans for vested shares under this plan were repaid on 31 October 2017.
An updated plan commenced on 16 December 2013. Under this plan, grants are made annually, with performance measured
over two and three-year periods. The value of each grant is set at the date of the grant and currently represents 15% to 40% of
an Executive Team member’s fixed remuneration. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee takes independent advice in
determining the number of shares to issue for each grant. Vesting of shares is subject to achievement of performance hurdles,
which are assessed over two and three-year periods.

Pay gap
The pay gap represents the number of times greater the Chief Executive Officer remuneration is to the remuneration of an
employee paid at the median of all Summerset employees. For the purposes of determining the median paid to all Summerset
employees, all permanent full-time, permanent part-time and fixed-term employees are included, with part-time employee
remuneration adjusted to a full-time equivalent amount.
At 31 December 2017, the Chief Executive Officer’s base salary of $545,400 was 12.5 times (2016: 11.6 times) that of the median
employee at $43,680 per annum. The Chief Executive Officer’s total remuneration, including STI and LTI, was $1,003,558, 21.5
times (2016: 21.7 times) the total remuneration of the median employee at $46,640.

The table above includes shares issued under the LTI plan prior to 1 April 2014, when the Chief Executive Officer took up this role
(previously Chief Financial Officer).
295,748 shares were vested on 31 December 2017 (out of a potential 353,484 shares eligible to vest on that date). These vested
shares are not eligible for exercise until 26 February 2018.

Employee remuneration
The number of employees or former employees (including employees holding office as Directors of subsidiaries), who received
remuneration and other benefits valued at or exceeding $100,000 during the financial year ended 31 December 2017 is
specified in the table below.
The remuneration figures shown in the “Remuneration” column includes all monetary payments actually paid during the course
of the year ended 31 December 2017. The table also includes the grant value of shares issued to individual employees under
Summerset’s LTI Plan during the same period. The table does not include amounts paid after 31 December 2017 that relate to
the year ended 31 December 2017.
