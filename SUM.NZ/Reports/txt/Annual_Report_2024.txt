Term

Definition

Broadacre site

A broadacre site refers to a large area of land which can be used for large scale projects. In Summerset’s
case, we typically select sites of 8-10 hectares where we can build 220-250 villas as well as a village centre
building with care centre

Care bed

A bed/room at Summerset that allows a resident to have rest home, hospital or dementia level care

Care suite

Rest home, hospital or dementia level care rooms/apartments that are subject to an ORA with a DMF. Care
suites are typically larger than a standard care room

Care centre

The area in a Summerset village where Summerset provides care to residents with a team of 24/7
registered nurses and caregivers. Rest home, hospital and dementia level care or other specialist care is
provided in the care centre (subject to availability)

Completed
village

Villages where all units, the care centre and common facilities have been completed and delivered

Continuum
of care

The ongoing levels/progression of care offered by Summerset to our residents. Summerset's model is
to provide options for our residents should their health needs change. This means residents can move
from an independent home or apartment into care within the same village (subject to availability and
eligibility criteria)

Deferred
management
fee (DMF)

This is the fee charged by Summerset to residents in our villages under their ORA (the standard rate is 25%
of the ORA price, which accumulates over a five-year period). The calculated DMF which is applicable in
each case is deducted from the amount repaid to the outgoing resident upon resale of the unit. The fee is
in consideration for the right to accommodation and the use of communal facilities over the entire length
of a resident's stay

Developing
village

These are Summerset villages that have commenced construction or are still in the construction
phase. Some developing villages may be open to residents

Development
margin

This is calculated using the first ORA sales receipt for the applicable unit, less the cost for developing
the applicable unit sold under ORA. Costs incorporate the land cost, share of infrastructure costs, direct
costs, share of other costs (e.g. landscaping), management fees and interest costs. The development
margin excludes recreation and administration facility costs and care centre costs (for non-ORA units)

FY

Refers to Summerset's financial year

Hospitallevel care

This refers to a higher level of care offered to residents in our care centres that provide nursing care 24
hours a day to assist residents who require fulltime assistance

Independent
resident

Residents who live in a Summerset village with minimal or no care or assistance required. Some
independent residents may have a services agreement, which provides additional support such as
personal services, meals, housekeeping or laundry, in addition to their ORA depending on their
individual circumstances

Land bank

This refers to land purchased by Summerset that it has available to build on and grow future or
ongoing developments

Memory care

This refers to an increased level of care for residents with dementia who choose Summerset as their
home. Memory care has been developed to enable people living with dementia to continue to lead active
lives in a safe and homely environment. Some villages have secure memory care centres for residents
who require this level of care

New village

A new village registered or being commissioned by Summerset. Often, a new village will still be under
construction, where brand new homes are being sold to new residents

Occupation right
agreement (ORA)

This is the principal agreement that Summerset has with the majority of residents that occupy a home in
our villages. An occupation right agreement within the meaning of the Retirement Villages Act 2023 (for
villages in New Zealand) or a residence contract within the meaning of the Retirement Villages Act 1986

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Term

Definition
(Vic) (for villages in Australia): gives residents the right to live in a home at their Summerset village, and
outlines the terms and conditions of their residency

Proposed village

A planned Summerset village where resource consent has not yet been granted and construction has not
yet started

Resale village

A completed Summerset village where all homes have been sold. A resale village typically would be
reselling homes on ORA as residents leave

Resident

Any person who lives at a Summerset village independently, in a serviced apartment or care unit under
a contract with Summerset

Rest homelevel care

An increased level of care offered to our residents with care provided to residents by our caregivers
with oversight of registered nurses. Depending on a resident's needs this can include daily personal care
and meals

Uncontracted
stock

Summerset retirement village homes that are for sale and not currently under a contract for occupation
or sale

Underlying profit

Non-GAAP financial measure used by Summerset to monitor financial performance and determine
dividend distributions. Calculated by making the following adjustments to reported net profit after
tax: Removing the change in fair value in investment properties, removing any impairment, removing
non-operating one-off items, adding back realised gains from resales, adding back realised development
margin from new sales, removing the deferred taxation component of taxation expense so only the
current tax expense is reflected

Village centre

This is sometimes referred to as the "main building", and generally is the communal two- to three-storey
building in the village which can include the care centre, serviced apartments, staff offices and resident
amenities such as the libary, cafe, theatre and pool

Weekly fees

Fees residents pay towards the costs of running the village, such as staffing, insurance, council rates,
maintenance, landscaping and rubbish removal at the respective Summerset village where they are
a resident

Annual Report 2024

Chair and CEO’s
report
Welcome to Summerset’s annual
report for the 12 months ended
31 December 2024. We have
been managing one of the most
challenging business environments
we’ve seen as a company, and
in the circumstances we believe
Summerset has shown considerable
resilience and has delivered value for
residents and investors.
Mark Verbiest
Chair
06

Through much of 2024, inflation,
weak consumer confidence, a softer
than anticipated property market
and rising costs all combined
to make trading conditions
extremely challenging.
Despite these challenges we saw
1,238 sales of ORAs, our highest
year. We were pleased to see the
strength of our diversified portfolio
in 2024 also, with eight different
regions seeing 30 or more sales.

Scott Scoullar
Chief Executive Officer

We have continued to see strong
demand across the country and
have again seen high levels of
enquiry from prospective residents.
Our customers are highly motivated,
however the property market,
which was undoubtedly subdued
throughout 2024, restricted some of
our residents from selling their home
as quickly as they would like, slowing
some moves to our villages.
Even during an economic
downturn, we have highly motivated
customers, and it is clear a
move to our villages is, ultimately,
not solely dependent upon the
property market. Our prospective
residents' motivations to join
our village communities remain,

including security, community,
health concerns and much more.
The past year has also shown us
the benefits of our broadacre build
strategy. We are able to recycle
cash effectively across our ongoing
developments and with the benefit
of in-house construction in New
Zealand we have flexed our build
programme to reduce construction
where demand has been lighter and
focus our work in other areas.
With demand continuing to
appear robust, we have further
strengthened our development
pipeline in New Zealand with the
purchase of three new parcels of
land to build future villages, and
two land purchases to expand
existing villages. While 2024 has
presented business challenges,
the softer property market has
provided us with opportunities for
well-priced acquisitions.
Our Australian development also
continues to progress with another
milestone achieved this year: our
first residents moving into our
Cranbourne North village. Our
Cranbourne village is on track and
we’ve begun construction on the
village’s main building which will
be home to our first Australian
care residents when complete. We
continue to take a measured and
cautious approach to our Australian
development as we build our
knowledge of that market.
Our hard work has been recognised
externally with Summerset receiving
a number of awards this year
from industry bodies, consumers

CHAIR AND CEO’S REPORT

Boulcott opened its village centre building during the year

and financial bodies including
winning Gold for the Reader's Digest
2025 Quality Service Award in the
Retirement Villages category for the
second year in a row, and an Ethical
and Sustainable Business Award.
Business performance
Underlying profit for 2024 is
$206.4 million, an increase of 8%
on 2023. Our IFRS net profit after
tax is $339.8 million, down 20%
on 2023, this change is largely
reflective of the fair value movement
of investment properties recognised
in 2024, relative to 2023.

Boulcott village in Lower Hutt in
2024. All three villages have strong
demand but it takes time to sell down
three large scale initiatives like these.
At a typical village we open a number
of stages of villas before building
the village centre, which is home
to a large number of homes, in
addition to the village amenity such
as the pool, café and theatre. At our
St Johns and Boulcott sites we’ve
opened the village centres in the
early stages of the villages' lives
as planned.

We believe that we've managed the
business effectively through very
challenging market conditions.

Having care available immediately,
along with the communal facilities,
increases the village's appeal to
our prospective residents, but it
means we have higher levels of
uncontracted stock than normal due
to the village centres being home to
a large number of apartments and
care suites. When we exclude the
new village centre building homes
our uncontracted stock is down
between 20-50% across all unit
types year-on-year, a very pleasing
result in a tough market.

Levels of uncontracted stock have
increased on FY23 by 40% but
this is unsurprising as we opened
our flagship St Johns village in
Auckland, the village centre building
at our Pāpāmoa village and our new

The Board is pleased to declare
a final dividend of 13.2 cents
per share, payable on 27 March
2025. Combined with our interim
dividend of 11.3 cents per share,
shareholders have received 24.5

Operating cash flows of
$443.2 million have increased 11%
from last year. The value of
our investment property is now
$7.3 billion, up 14% on 2023, largely as
a result of additions to our retirement
unit portfolio across New Zealand
and Australia and favourable fair
value movements.

cents per share for the 2024 financial
year, consistent with 2023.
Costs
With market conditions constrained
we have worked hard to reduce our
costs. In the first half of the year a full
review of operating expenses was
undertaken to assist in managing our
balance sheet through the tougher
economic conditions.
Construction costs are an ongoing
focus for us and we are benefitting
from the subcontract tender market
reductions in line with reduced
sector activity. Our Procurement
team, which won the prestigious
Transformation of the Year award
at the annual New Zealand
Procurement Excellence Forum
(NZPEF) Awards in 2024, has worked
hard to secure value-for-money
long-term contracts through strong
relationships with our key suppliers.
Our hard work has seen us deliver
a healthy development margin
through 2024 of 28.9%, well above
the 20–25% guidance we gave
last year.
We have long felt our weekly
fees policy is an appropriate and
sustainable model. Costs such as
rates and insurance at our villages
increased markedly in 2024 which

we were able to offset somewhat
with our flexible weekly fees.

pipeline and have increased our land
bank by more than 1,100 new units.

Our New Zealand weekly fees
are linked to Superannuation and
any increase does not exceed
the percentage increase to NZ
Superannuation. This year, while NZ
Superannuation increased by 4.65%,
our weekly fees increased by 3.75%.
We made the decision to keep our
2024 weekly fee increase below the
percentage increase of NZ Super to
try and balance the ongoing costof-living crisis that was impacting
our residents, while looking to offset
the increasing operating costs of
our villages.

The new land for proposed
villages is:

In Australia our fees are linked to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) and do
not exceed the percentage increase
of CPI to provide Australian residents
with the same peace of mind when
budgeting for their retirement.
08

New Zealand land acquisitions
and development
Our New Zealand land bank is welldiversified with proposed village
sites from Auckland to Dunedin. To
enable growth, approximately 80%
of our land bank has been consented
(excluding sites acquired in 2024).
The diversity of our land bank gives
us flexibility in the rate and location
of development, so we can respond
to localised demand and supply, and
the changing economic conditions.
This year our proposed village at
Masterton received consent, and our
proposed Mosgiel village is on the
list of projects in the Government’s
Fast-track Approvals Act.
While we have experienced a market
downturn in 2024, by exercising
careful due diligence we continue
to find well-priced land in highdemand areas.
During the year we acquired three
new sites for proposed villages
and two extensions to existing
villages. These opportunities have
strengthened our development

•

•

Mission Hills in Napier - in August
we announced the purchase
of our site in the Mission Hills
subdivision. The new subdivision
will offer excellent facilities
and amenitites for residents
including parks, shopping and
dining, and the village will be a
short drive from central Napier.
Otaihanga on the Kāpiti Coast
– this new 12.6-hectare site
is in a very popular area for
retirees and will complement
our existing Paraparaumu and
Waikanae villages.
Belmont in Auckland - just
minutes north of Devonport, an
extremely desirable location for
our prospective residents. The
5.7-hectare block has great views
of the city, and the proposed
village will predominantly feature
low-rise homes which will
help it stand out in an
area where apartment-heavy
retirement villages are the norm.

Our two village extensions are at our
Boulcott (Lower Hutt) and Blenheim
sites where we’ve acquired land
adjacent to the village to develop
more homes. Village extensions are
very profitable and allow Summerset
to add high-value homes, in highdemand villages where we already
have capacity in the supporting
village infrastructure.
As we have a reasonably sized
land bank for future development,
we regularly review the portfolio
to ensure the economics of
development continue to meet,
or better, the original assumptions
relied on at purchase. We will
remain disciplined to ensure the
appropriate allocation of capital,
and on the odd occasion may sell
parcels purchased.

New Zealand construction
During 2024 we have been very
deliberate about how we manage
our portfolio. This past year has
been an excellent example of the
flexibility we can bring to our build
programme - we slowed down
some of our work where demand
was lighter and concentrated our
efforts elsewhere.
As we signalled in our Half
Year Report we have deliberately
delivered at the lower end of our
675–725 build guidance, delivering
676 homes under ORA and 21
care beds in New Zealand. This
reflects growth of around 2% in
construction numbers.
Our Construction team worked
across 18 New Zealand sites this year,
including delivering our two new
village centre buildings at Boulcott
and St Johns and upgrades to
modernise the care offering for
residents at three of our oldest
villages – Levin, Havelock North
and Trentham.
We also commenced construction at
our Kelvin Grove (Palmerston North)
village and the extension at our
Cambridge village.
We delivered our flagship
Summerset St Johns village on time
and on budget in Q3. This complex
build on the 2.6 hectare site, in the
heart of Auckland, features six multistorey buildings with excellent views
of Auckland city and Rangitoto. The
village was officially opened by New
Zealand Prime Minister the Rt. Hon.
Christopher Luxon in December.
We continue to believe our
broadacre construction strategy is
the best short- and medium-term
option for us, which is why we plan
to only run one or two metropolitan
builds like St Johns at a time so we
can prudently manage our debt.
The other major metropolitan build
we now have underway is our Half
Moon Bay site in Auckland where
construction began in Q3.

CHAIR AND CEO’S REPORT

Our quality amenity at St Johns is immediately apparent on entering the village centre lobby

Our advanced build programme
means that we can flex our
construction as we need to and
we expect to build 600-650 homes
in FY25. We are taking a prudent
approach to the current economic
situation but will monitor this
throughout 2025.
Australia
Our development and expansion
in Australia is continuing as we
continue to look to prudently expand
our footprint and consent our land
bank to grow and allow us to meet
the forecast demand in this market.
In FY25 we expect to deliver between
50-80 homes to be sold under
ORA including the village centre at
Cranbourne North (which will be
delivered late in FY25 and open to
residents in FY26).
In addition to the major milestone
of welcoming our first Australian
residents at Cranbourne North and
commencing construction on the
village centre building, the second
stage of the village was handed
over in December and we delivered
a public park as part of our
development in October.
Construction also started in FY24
on our second Australian village,
Chirnside Park, which is scheduled

to deliver its first homes at the
end of 2025, and in late 2024
we started enabling works on our
Torquay village on the Surf Coast.
We continue to see Australia
as a huge growth opportunity
for Summerset, and we are
investigating land opportunities in
Victoria and Queensland.
Our people
Throughout FY24 we’ve invested
in our people to give them
opportunities, provide a better
workplace and to give them
tools and services that help them
professionally and personally.
To thank our people for their hard
work over the year, every permanent
Summerset staff member was
gifted an additional day of paid
leave to take some extra time for
themselves over the Christmas and
New Year period.
We are pleased to report that
728 permanent staff received free
Summerset shares this year as
part of the vesting of our annual
staff share scheme, and 2,060
eligible staff received $1,000 of
Summerset shares which vest in
September 2027.

In Q1 we changed our employee
assistance partner to TELUS Health
which provides our staff with
free and confidential counselling,
coaching and support as well as
a wellbeing platform and app with
numerous resources, courses and
health assessments for mental,
physical and financial health. These
services have been made available
to our staff’s families as well.
The health and safety of everyone
at Summerset, is of course, a top
priority for the business. In FY24,
we entered the second year of
our Safe People, Safe Process, Safe
Places strategy, achieving significant
progress in key areas of health
and safety. A major milestone
was the successful implementation
of a new health and safety
reporting, recording and assurance
system – HSI Donesafe. Donesafe
allows us to get even better
at recording and analysing any
incidents, issues or near misses, and
continously improve how we keep
our people safe.
Care and funding
Summerset is committed to
investing in, and providing, highquality care. We have invested, and
will continue to invest, in the care
that our residents expect.

09

Annual Report 2024

However, we are acutely aware
that care is underfunded in New
Zealand. Health New Zealand – Te
Whatu Ora increased aged care
funding by 3.2% in 2024. This is far
below the New Zealand Aged Care
Association’s (NZACA) estimate that
an 11% increase was required for
providers to cover escalating costs
over the year.
This funding gap has prompted us
to make some changes to how we
sell care, and the size of our future
care centres.

10

Our newest care centres, and our
future builds, are smaller with fewer
beds available. They typically house
30 residents compared to the
approximately 50 in our older care
centres. These care centres are
focused on meeting the needs of our
village residents and providing them
with a continuum of care if their care
requirements change. We will accept
far fewer care residents from the
public health system, or from outside
the village, than we did before
because the aged care funding gap
means that we cannot continue
to incur losses by accepting nonvillage residents into care.
Also, to protect ourselves financially
we are increasing the number of care
suites we sell under ORA, rather than
offering only a daily premium charge
model. This gives both Summerset
and our residents greater financial
certainty while recognising what is
necessary for economic viability. Our
residents have supported the move
and we’ve seen the number of care
suites selling under ORAs increase
steadily year-on-year.
While these changes have helped to
make our model more sustainable
long-term, we are considering other
changes. Currently we take a large
number of care resident referrals
from public health, but the funding
we receive is far less than is
required to provide quality aged
care services.

We are currently reviewing our
policies and where this funding gap
is leaving us, we feel we need to
focus the limited funding we have
and our staff resources on our village
residents and their needs only. This
review could result in us no longer
accepting referrals from the public
health system.
It’s not a step we want to take but
we can’t create a system where we
overstretch our staff. We know this
will mean a bigger burden will be
placed on the public health system,
but we can’t keep taking the strain.
We will continue to strongly support
the NZACA’s work to highlight the
underfunding of aged care in New
Zealand and the consequences for
us all if a growing elderly population
does not have access to quality
care. Summerset is now represented
on the NZACA board, a first for
Summerset, by CEO Scott Scoullar.
While we are not yet offering care in
Australia, we plan to from 2026, and
we note the funding environment
is less challenging for providers,
with federal law makers approving
a significant boost in aged care
funding during 2024.
Regulation
Both the Australian and New
Zealand governments have been
considering changes to legislation
relevant to Summerset’s operations.
From what we understand of
the proposed legislative changes
currently articulated, our practices
already align with the proposed
changes and we don’t anticipate any
material changes to our operations
in either country.
In New Zealand the government
has indicated that they would like
to consider greater transparency
for a Retirement Villages’ Code
of Practice, increase protections
for residents such as restrictions
on passing on insurance excesses,
and that they will take advice
on three key areas: passing on

the cost of maintaining operatorowned chattels, the management
of complaints and disputes,
and incentivising earlier capital
repayments when residents leave
the village.
Summerset supports practicable
measures that require operators
to lift standards. We have worked
hard to provide plain English
documentation, we cap insurance
excesses at $250, we don’t charge
for the maintenance or repairs of
chattels in our village that we own,
and we pay interest to a resident,
or their estate, if their home hasn’t
sold after six months of leaving
the village.
We also support a fair and
transparent disputes resolution
option if we can’t agree with a
resident or their family on an issue.
In Australia a new Aged Care Act
has been passed by Parliament
and will commence from 1 July
2025. The reforms will increase
accountability for operators through
strengthened standards and include
the introduction of user pays
provisions for funding models.
It is our view that Summerset
is well placed to benefit from
the reforms when our care
operations commence.
Resident initiatives and events
We have continued to evolve our
offering to our residents to provide
them a unique retirement living
offering and to shape what we
do in our villages to meet the
changing needs and expectations of
our residents.
Our work has been recognised by
our residents, with our satisfaction
score hitting an all-time high in 2024,
at 97% for both village and care.
We have continued to build on our
"Summerset sessions", a range of
in-person and online events and
experiences to engage residents
and we introduced new resident

CHAIR AND CEO’S REPORT

events such as the Summerset
Games and the Summerset's Best
Garden competition.
We have continued to expand our
Holiday Homes programme, which
offers residents and their families a
fully furnished apartment in one of
our villages to rent. Six villages from
Auckland to Christchurch now offer
a holiday home.
In care we know that our
menus and food offering are
a crucial part of our residents’
experience. We have significantly
changed our menus for our care
and serviced apartment residents
following residents’ feedback to
ensure we provide more choice.
We also piloted a remote nursing
service at a number of our villages
throughout the year to assist our
care centre staff. The 24/7 team
of Summerset registered nurses
support village teams online or by
phone. Our safe staffing ratios in our
care centres (our registered nurses
and caregivers to resident ratios),
remain the same and the remote
nurses provide an extra layer of
support when caring for residents.
It also allows us to share the expertise
of highly qualified registered nurses
among a number of villages.

Design and technology
The design and features of our
village have evolved further over the
last year as we change our offering
to meet resident expectations and to
provide more points of interest and
difference that increase the vibrancy
of our villages.
Throughout the country we’ve
investigated how we can add new
features for residents to enjoy, and in
2024 we installed or piloted features
such as golf simulators, dog washes,
shuffle boards, pétanque pistes and
more green spaces.
We’ve also further developed our
technology to make residents’ lives
easier. Our Lumin technology is now
installed at 17 villages. Lumin allows
residents to communicate with
each other, book activities, access
entertainment, receive messages
from their Village Manager and
much more, all on a specially
designed system for elderly users.
We are currently piloting the use of
Lumin for emergency call bells at our
Paraparaumu village too.
We’ve installed technology to
allow our staff to spend more
time with their residents. We’ve
rolled out the app version of our
resident care system – VCare –
which means our staff can update

records in a resident’s room and
input any necessary information
without having to return to the
nurses’ station.
Sustainability
We are proud of our industry-leading
approach to sustainability and we
made further improvements during
FY24 in how we measure, reduce and
report on our impacts.
We’re committed to fully
meeting our reporting requirements
on sustainability and we’ve
released our second Sustainability
Review and Climate-related
Disclosures document alongside
this Annual Report.
Two of our major achievements
this year are our work to move
our emissions target to a science
based target and our work around
embodied carbon.
Embodied carbon is a recent
focus for the business. We have
calculated the embodied carbon
for two of our standard build
typologies, establishing baseline
measurements for both. Already
we’ve seen significant reductions in
embodied carbon in the design of
our new three-bedroom townhouses
against this baseline.

11

Annual Report 2024

To align with current best practice
we underwent the rigorous process
of having our emissions target
upgraded and validated by the
Science Based Targets Initiative
(SBTi). This validation ensures
our target is grounded in the
latest climate science, utilising
standardised methodologies and
independent verification.
Other major initiatives and
milestones this year to reduce our
carbon footprint and improve our
resilience include:

12

•

Installing more than 1,000
solar panels

•

Reducing the upfront embodied
carbon of our townhouse homes
by 28%

•

Planted 80,000 native plants

•

Meeting all three of our
sustainability linked lending
performance targets

•

Continuing to focus on waste
diversion, we diverted than 4,400
tonnes of construction waste
this year

Our sustainability work has
been recognised again with our
construction waste avoidance
initiative and our Richmond Ranges
village solar panels installation
both being named finalists for
the Retirement Village Association’s
Sustainability Awards. We were
named a Sustainability Leader in the
Property & Construction category by
the Australian Financial Review, and
an Ethical and Sustainable Business
Award from Money Matters and
Catalyst Leadership.
Outside of awards, we were pleased
to be recognised by Forsyth Barr
again in their third Carbon and ESG
Ratings for NZX listed companies.
They have rated us in the top 10
of NZX-listed companies based on
their criteria.

FY24 report on the Summerset

Executive changes
The importance of technology in
Summerset’s success going forward
led us to elevate the Head of Group
Technology role to report to the
CEO directly, creating a Chief Digital
Officer role. Robyn Gillespie joined
Summerset in October to take on
this new role.
Robyn has over 30 years in senior
tech roles and joined us from WSP
where she was Chief Information
and Operating Officer for nine years.
Prior to that, Robyn spent four years
as General Manager Information
Technology at Downer.
We also appointed Margaret
Warrington as our new CFO
following Will Wright's departure
to rejoin Fletcher Building as their
Group CFO. Will grew a highly
capable and valued team in his time
at Summerset and fostered great
relationships with our investors and
other stakeholders.
Margaret has many years'
experience in CFO roles across
the public and private sectors
and joins Summerset from NZXlisted company EROAD. Margaret
was formerly Summerset's Head
of Finance and brings a strong
knowledge of the sector to her new
role – she rejoins Summerset in
February 2025.
Looking forward
While the short-term economic
outlook remains uncertain, we are
optimistic for the coming year. We
have come through one of the most
challenging years in Summerset’s
history with solid demand, high sales
numbers, and have significantly
bolstered our land bank.
In addition, we have met our
targeted build rate, welcomed
our first Australian residents, and

continued to invest in our people and
in our residents' experience.
During 2024 we showed the
strength of Summerset’s position
and balance sheet despite trading
in conditions labelled by some
commentators as worse than the
Global Financial Crisis. Our total
assets have grown 16% in the last
year to $8b, total equity has grown
14% to $3b and net tangible assets
per share are now $12.53, up 13%.
We will continue to take a
prudent approach to our balance
sheet management in FY25.
While economic conditions remain
restrictive we will manage our New
Zealand build rate and adjust where
we need to, while still growing
in Australia.
Subject to economic conditions,
which at this point we do think could
linger through the first half of 2025,
we look forward to continued strong
performance in the year ahead.
Finally, on behalf of the Summerset
Board and management, we’d like
to thank our investors, residents and
partners for your commitment to,
and belief in, Summerset’s goals and
future. We’d also like to thank our
Summerset team and their families
for another successful year.

St Johns

14

Summerset St Johns is our flagship village which was
delivered on time and on budget in October FY24.
This complex build on a 2.6ha site
in the heart of Auckland features
six multi-storey buildings with
excellent views of Auckland city
and Rangitoto.
We purchased the 127-year lease on
our St Johns site in 2015 and after
a lengthy consenting process we
began the build in 2020. Despite
Summerset St Johns was officially
opened by the Prime Minister,
Rt. Hon. Christopher Luxon,
on 6 December 2024.

multiple Covid lockdowns and
supply chain obstacles our design
and construction teams have
delivered a breathtaking village.
The first stage of the village, which
welcomed its first residents in
October 2024, contains 60% of the
homes. The village features a mix
of one-, two- and three-bedroom
apartments and includes several
penthouses with views across
the city. The penthouses, valued
up to $6m, are some of the most
valuable retirement village homes
sold in the country to date.
This stage also included all of the
village amenity, which means
residents can use their facilities such
as the pool, library, café and theatre
from the moment they move in. This
is a feature unique to Summerset
St Johns as typically, with our
broadacre offering, the village
centre building isn’t opened until a
number of stages are complete.

The second and third stages are
underway with stage two to be
completed in 2025 and stage
three to follow, which will include a
number of high-value villas. When
complete the village will be home
to approximately 450 residents.
In recognition of the needs and
demands of our target audience
for this village we’ve added
unique features including the
café, which will turn into a bistro
for evening dining, our chauffeurdriven Summerset St Johns vehicle
for residents to book, and roles
unique to the villages including
an executive chef and resident
experience manager to provide an
enhanced experience.
The village also includes care
suites, care apartments and
memory care centre providing
continuum of care options for our
residents if their needs change.

Summerset’s strategy was
set in 2023 and has short
and long-term goals for the next
10 years. It help us prioritise our

• Deliver appropriate returns
to the shareholders who help
fund our business

We have six strategic pillars, each
with a number of initiatives under
them, that we’ll pursue over the
next 10 years to grow and
continue delivering great
experiences for our residents.
Our pillars are: Invest in our
People, Deliver New Zealand’s
best retirement villages, Grow
in Australia, Be a good corporate
citizen, Create attractive new
products and services and
Be a more efficient and
effective business.

OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

Our people and
community
We’re proud to be home to more than 8,700
retirement village residents throughout New
Zealand and in Victoria, Australia. Our vibrant
and diverse communities are built, run and
supported by more than 3,000 staff.
Bringing the best of life is
Summerset’s purpose, and we value
and recognise our people who
are at the heart of delivering this
to our residents. Our business
functions across Australasia are
multi-faceted, employing a diverse
range of roles to design beautiful
villages, construct high-quality
homes and buildings, give our
residents amazing experiences and
care, and bring new residents to live
in our villages every week.
Summerset is dedicated to
creating retirement villages that
go beyond providing homes and
evolve into thriving communities
underpinned by our strong
customer service philosophy.
An outstanding achievement for
us this year was again winning
the coveted Reader’s Digest 2025
Quality Service Award in the
Retirement Villages category. To find
those companies that provide the
highest level of customer service
and that truly understand and value
consumer needs, Reader’s Digest
approaches everyday consumers
to ask them to assess companies
across five pillars of customer

service. These prestigious awards
have been running for 11 years,
and taking top spot two years in
a row is a testament to our team's
commitment to continue bringing
the best of life.

We were also delighted
to again see a
number of our
villages recognised in
the Aged Advisor’s
"People's Choice
Awards" for 2024.
Summerset on Cavendish won
the Best Large Retirement/Lifestyle
Village in the South Island, with
Summerset in the River City
(Whanganui) being a North Island
finalist. Summerset Prebbleton
was a finalist in the Best
Small Retirement/Lifestyle Village
category, and Summerset Group
was a finalist in the Best Provider
Nationwide category.

This recognition is based purely on
nearly 4,000 independent reviews
and ratings of retirement villages and
aged care facilities from residents
and their families throughout New
Zealand and underscores the
genuine affection our residents have
for the lifestyle we offer.
Engaging residents
We pride ourselves on the
opportunities socially, physically
and mentally that we provide
our residents to enhance their
retirement experiences, and our
annual resident engagement scores
are an indicator of how well we’re
getting those experiences right.
This year, 97% of village residents
tell us that they are very
satisfied, satisfied or neutral with
their experience, which is an
improvement over 2023. Valuing
our safe and secure community
environment, friendly and caring
residents and staff, always having a
great range of activities and events
to take part in, and lovely grounds,
amenities and homes are what our
residents most liked about living
in a Summerset village. For our

27

Annual Report 2024

care residents, 97% are also very
satisfied, satisfied or neutral, with
many praising the professionalism
and care they receive from our staff.
Traditionally Summerset has used
the Retirement Villages Association
measure of customer satisfaction,
using ratings 3-5, to align with the
retirement and aged care sector.
In line with our 'striving to be the
best' Summerset value, internally
we assess how well we're doing
using only 4-5 ratings (satisfied or
very satisfied) which was 90% for
village resident respondents and
82% for care.

Events and experiences
Our “Summerset Sessions” deliver
a varied programme of events and
entertainment that residents can
enjoy in person or online. This
much enjoyed programme includes
events, concerts, cooking lessons
(with former MasterChef winner
Brett McGregor) and interviews
with well-known Kiwis. Various
Summerset Sessions were held at
villages around the country and were
filmed at the same time so they could
be enjoyed on-demand.
We also held regional events,
bringing multiple villages' residents
together for a showcase event
such as the Summerset Sings
Christmas concert in Wellington with

Will Martin and the New Zealand
Symphony Orchestra.
To highlight the vibrancy and variety
of village life, and to introduce
the wonderful residents who call
it their home, we created our “A
Summerset World” video series,
which is available on our website.
Every episode profiles a different
village, giving a glimpse into what
makes each village fun, unique and
an interesting place to live, while
getting to meet some of the talented
and interesting residents living there.
This year we featured Summerset on
the Landing (Kenepuru), Summerset
at Pohutukawa Place (Bell Block),
and Summerset Mountain View
(New Plymouth).
Retire Ready is a free financial
wellbeing series designed for those
planning or already at retirement
age, which we launched in 2024.
Partnering with financial planning
expert Liz Koh, the series was
developed in response to research
and feedback from people aged 40
and over wanting to feel confident
and certain about their financial
position and needs as they age. The
programme has received excellent

Additionally, we use a Net Promoter
Score (NPS), which is a measure
used to gauge customer loyalty,
satisfaction and enthusiasm with a
company, where an NPS over 20
is deemed favourable, and above
50, excellent. Our NPS for village
residents was 46, indicating most
residents are rating the question of
whether they would recommend us
to their friends and family (on a scale
of 0-10), with a 9 or 10. Similarly our
care NPS was high with a score of 38.

We also survey our residents
regularly throughout the year on
various aspects of village life to
understand what is and isn’t working
for them. This gives us insight
into what we're doing well across
the country and also allows our
village managers to understand and
change things at their village to
better reflect the needs and wants
of their residents.

fun experiences.

Many of our residents continue
to be highly competitive, and our
Summerset Games, held in August,
provided an array of sports events
and activities that also saw some
villages holding inter-village events
to up the stakes. Villages held
Games opening ceremonies and
concluded with medal and closing
ceremonies. With fun, participation
and enjoyment at the heart of the
Games, there were still plenty of
serious competitors.

A home-away-from-home
experience designed to bring loved
ones closer together was behind
our “Holiday Homes” initiative.
This programme offers short-term
accommodation exclusively for
Summerset residents, and their
families and friends, in villages
around New Zealand. Following a
successful trial in 2023 at three
villages, a further three villages were
added in 2024.

for our green-fingered residents.
The seasonally run competitions
showcase how talented our
residents are at tending to their
gardens, plants and veggies. Judged
by top New Zealand landscape
designer and well-known TV and
radio host, Tony Murrell, it continues
to be very successful. We're working
on further competitions for our
residents to display their skills, with
writing and craft options being
developed to explore with our

Offering on-site convenience
and best value for money for
residents and their families in a
fully furnished, comfortable, selfcontained apartment it allows
residents to travel and stay in familiar
surroundings and the opportunity
to host their family in their village.
We now have holiday homes in
Hawke's Bay, Auckland, Wellington,
Christchurch and Tasman available
for our residents to book.
We continue to invest in technology
that enhances the lives and
experiences of our residents.
Lumin, our resident communication

and entertainment system is now
installed at 17 villages. Lumin gives
residents the ability to message
and call each other, receive village
notices and newsletters and is a
booking platform for meals, events,
and other village services.
Enhancing our care services
Our care offering, and our
continuum of care model, is a
very important part of why our
residents choose us and we want
to continually evolve our offering
and introduce new initiatives that will
bring the best of life to our residents.
We focus on providing high-quality
aged care for our residents already
living in our care facilities and
offering an ongoing continuum of
care with priority placement for our
village residents. Our care business
saw occupancy rates this year at 94%
in our developed villages.
During 2024 we opened three
village centre buildings in our
Pāpāmoa, Boulcott and St Johns
villages, which, in addition to
a range of beautiful village
amenities, also contain our serviced

29

Annual Report 2024

apartments and state-of-the-art care
centres and memory care centres
specially designed for those living
with dementia.
Dementia is a growing concern
in New Zealand, and we know
that some residents living with
dementia can continue to live
independently with the right support
and community in place. In May
we held focus groups with some
of our independent residents and
also with some families of residents
living with dementia, to understand
their specific needs and explore
ongoing support including raising
community awareness, tackling
stigma, supporting inclusion and
providing education on resources
and care pathways.

30

As we evolve, we look at what
changes we may need to make
to ensure we continue to provide
the care our residents need and
expect. In addition to investing in
new care facilities in new villages,
we are committed to progressively
upgrading our older care centres.
The care centre refurbishment
programme at our Levin, Trentham
and Havelock North villages has
progressed well with planning
now underway for Trentham and
Havelock North to reopen with their
new centres in 2025.
We have invested in equipment
and technology to make our care
residents more comfortable and
to maximise the effectiveness of
their care.
Early in the year we commenced a
pilot with six villages where we have
created a remote nursing service
we’ve called the National Clinical
Support Service. This is a 24/7 team
of Summerset registered nurses who
support the pilot village teams online
or by phone.
Our safe staffing ratios in our care
centres (our registered nurses and
caregivers to resident ratios), remain
the same, meaning that our care

centre teams have an extra layer of
support when caring for residents,
and it allows us to share the expertise
of highly qualified registered nurses
among a number of villages. The
pilot progressed well throughout the
year and we added a further three
villages towards the end of 2024. We
will assess the pilot in 2025 to look
at whether it's something we want to
do across all our care centres.
We have continued with the roll
out of installing ceiling hoists at all
our care centres to aid residents
with mobility difficulties. We now
have ceiling hoists in 19 villages
with the remainder to be completed
in 2025. The ceiling hoists are far
more comfortable, and residents tell
us they feel safer than the manual
hoists. They’re also easier to operate
for our staff and reduce the risk
of strains when assisting a resident
to move.
Following a successful pilot we
have rolled out the app of our
resident and care management
software (VCare) in 2024. The app
allows staff to enter resident care
information at the time the care is
delivered, with the benefit of saving
staff valuable time to spend with
residents directly, and also ensuring
that the resident information is
shared efficiently and effectively
among care team members.
We believe in providing excellence
in our clinical care from skilled
staff. Summerset remains the
only aged care organisation
in New Zealand to employ a
Clinical Pharmacist, recognising
the importance of enhancing
medication management practice
and safety in our villages, including
the safe and appropriate use of highrisk medications. This role works with
prescribers to ensure medications
are being used appropriately and
only when required, supporting our
continuous improvement work of
optimisation and appropriateness
of medications such as the use

of psychotropic medications for
residents living with dementia.
We’ve seen improvements across
our care centres through boosting
Vitamin D prescriptions, a required
medicine for many older people
living in aged care, and also
reducing the number of residents
prescribed a high number of
medicines. Sometimes people are
on medications that they no longer
need or are no longer the best option
for them.
Lifting our profile
In order to attract new residents, we
need to have a strong and distinctive
brand presence that positions who
Summerset is and the fresh and
vibrant life we enable.
New Zealand’s retirement village
sector is a highly competitive
environment for advertising. In 2024
we launched a new advertising
campaign “Dear Diary”, which aims
to differentiate Summerset in the
market and bring our stories to
life through the diary entries of a
charismatic resident. Independent
research shows the campaign is
resonating well with our target
audience. Across those in the sector,
our research shows, we have the
highest percentage that correctly
attribute the adverts to Summerset,
and messaging and out-takes are
being correctly received.
The series of advertisements put a
spotlight on features of Summerset
village living such as finding
community and companionship,
security and fun, the liberation and
freedom that comes from the village
environment, and above all else, the
choice for residents to live life on
their terms.
Our ability to reflect vitality and
freedom of ageing and retirement in
our communications, saw continued
high demand for our offering
with our cost-per-enquiry metric
decreasing showing improved
efficiencies in our lead generation.

We have an ongoing desire
and commitment to support
sponsorships and partnerships that
that align with our brand and values.
We deliberately choose national
partnerships with organisations that
resonate with our residents and
their families, and we’re proud to
have continued to support the
following organisations in New
Zealand during 2024:

We regularly review our partnership
portfolio and their arrangements
to ensure they align with our
business priorities.
In local communities where our
villages are across Australasia,
and will be in the future, we
have worked with approximately
218 local community clubs and
organisations, including bowls, golf,
bridge and croquet clubs, Age
Concern, Lions, Rotary, RSAs and
more. These partnerships help us to
invest in, and support, organisations
that are important to our current
and future residents in our wider
village communities.
We continue to look for other
opportunities to give back to the
community as they arise. In 2024 this

included donating materials from
our Trentham care centre to the
local Scouts. The Scouts were given
their choice of items that were being
removed as part of the care centre's
upgrade. We also donated a fully
refurbished van from our Wigram
village to the Wellington City Mission
to help them in transporting their
clients to various programmes in
the city.
Engaging our people
Our people are exceptional and
valued - without them we couldn’t
deliver a quality retirement living
experience to the more than
8,700 residents who have made
Summerset their home.
We strive to ensure we create a
great place for them to work and
thrive, and we are committed to the
protection and promotion of their
health and wellbeing so they can
be at their best both at home and
at work.
Our wellbeing programme provides
an intranet hub with support
tools that sit alongside a calendar
of regular communications on

wellbeing initiatives, spanning
physical, mental and financial health.
We commenced a new partnership
with TELUS Health this year, offering
our people, and their families, access
to free and confidential counselling,
coaching and support for their
personal or work-related wellbeing.

caregivers, activities coordinators
and people leaders working in
our villages.
Village staff received gifts and we
created "gratitude walls" displayed
in each village for frontliners'
colleagues, residents and residents'
families to express their appreciation
with handwritten notes. For those
unable to make it into a village, a
digital gratitude wall was created
with hundreds of messages from
around New Zealand and the world.
We publicly thanked our people too
with full page ads in a number of
newspapers and digital advertising.
We also had the opportunity to
celebrate our people at our annual
Applause Awards, Summerset’s staff
recognition event. We had a record
2,200 nominations across the 37
award categories, and finalists
were hosted at a gala event in
Christchurch that was also livestreamed for staff, residents, friends,
families and colleagues to share in
the occasion.
To provide an opportunity for staff
to be recognised more regularly
we continued our Surprise and
Delight programme, a monthly staff
recognition initiative.
We were pleased to have seen
engagement of our people continue
to strengthen. This was reflected
in our latest employee survey
which returned an engagement
score of 8.1 out of 10, putting
us in the top quartile of New
Zealand healthcare providers using
the same engagement survey. This
is a testament to the environment
we foster at our offices, villages and
construction sites.
Attracting and retaining talent
Differentiating Summerset as an
employer of choice led to the
development this year of our
Employee Value Proposition (EVP).
Our EVP can be considered as a staff
‘promise’ – what they can expect to
get from their company and what

they give to each other to have a
great workplace and career.
We intend to use our EVP to
better advertise our difference in the
market and to ensure our ‘promise’
stays consistent across our many
workplaces. We will roll out the EVP
and what it means to our people
during FY25.
Employee benefits provide an
opportunity for us to differentiate
ourselves as an employer of choice
in a competitive environment. We
offer a wide range of benefits
while also continuing to enhance
our rewards offering, and look to
improve our engagement with our
people through benefits that matter
to them. For example, all permanent
Summerset staff are offered free
health insurance and can receive an
annual $1,000 in Summerset shares
– two benefits which our people
value highly.
Providing leadership and
development pathways is important
to us in both attracting and retaining
our people too.
Our Construction Management
Cadet programme offers a pathway
for motivated people to get handson, practical experience across a
range of construction disciplines.
After a minimum two years of
work our successful management
cadets graduate to be fully trained
site supervisors or junior quantity
surveyors. This year we saw three
of our cohort successfully graduate
from the programme. These are
important roles for Summerset
to create a talent pathway and
to give talented and enthusiastic
construction workers opportunities
to progress their careers in a marketleading organisation.
In our villages we work
with Careerforce to provide
learning modules that upskill our
frontline staff.
In our food services area, to enable
an excellent team culture, high-

performing kitchens and retain great
people, this year all our Chef
Managers undertook leadership
training and development. The
programme supports them with
understanding their communication
style, delegating, coaching their
teams, and how in-turn to support
their staff on their career pathways.

While we know there
is more to do we
are pleased to see
our retention figures
increased 4% against
2023 to 81%, with
staff turnover reducing
significantly over the
past 12 months across
all roles.
Safe people, safe process,
safe places
Safeguarding the health, safety, and
wellbeing of everyone who works
with us, visits us, or lives with us
remains a top priority, and this
commitment is central to our threeyear Health and Safety Strategy.
Our 'Safe People, Safe Process,
Safe Places' strategy continues to
progress, underpinned by a strong
focus on managing critical risks. This
year, we conducted comprehensive
reviews of our top four critical
risks: Working at Height, Temporary
Works, Infectious Disease Control
and Fire and Natural Disasters. These
reviews provided valuable insights
into risk controls and ensured we
have the appropriate measures in
place to prevent significant injury,
harm or loss of life.
In alignment with the New Zealand
Business Leaders Health and Safety
Forum, we've shifted our focus
from lagging injury metrics, such

33

Annual Report 2024

Cards of grattitude for Summerset Richmond Ranges village staff displayed to celebrate Frontliners Day

as injury frequency rates, to leading
indicators that drive proactive
safety management. Key metrics
now include:
34

•

The number of events with
high potential for Serious Injury
or Fatality (SIF), which are
investigated as thoroughly as if
an injury had occurred

•

Reporting timeframes for
incidents as percentage
reported within 48-hours

•

Timeframes to complete
investigations and close out any
correct actions

•

Audit outcomes and the timely
close-out of corrective actions

These measures enable us to
assess whether critical safety tasks
are being effectively completed.
Our highest critical risk exposure
is working at heights. We
are committed to continuous
improvement, and we established
a working group to review the
events that had been occurring and
developed interventions to reduce
the risk and future number of these
events occurring. This work will
continue into 2025.
With the completion of our first year
of reporting, we've established a
baseline against these metrics which

allows us to now report on the
number of potential SIF events by
critical risk. The baseline provides a
foundation for future comparisons
and sustained improvement for
working at height and our overall
health and safety performance.

Summerset Pride Network is a
group of allies and LGBTTQIA+
community members who are
committed to bringing the best of
life by supporting, educating, and
empowering staff and residents,
making Summerset inclusive for all.

By building on these insights,
we remain focused on creating
safer environments and driving
continuous improvement in health,
safety and wellbeing across
our business.

In March, led by our Pride Network,
we became a member of Pride
Pledge, committing to create
a workplace where LGBTTQIA+
people are safe, included, and
visible, and using our voice to
actively support and celebrate
rainbow communities. The Pride
Pledge resources, including rainbow
awareness online training tools, will
help us on our journey.

Our commitment to diversity
and inclusion
At Summerset we are committed to
developing an inclusive workplace
where all our people can feel a sense
of equity, inclusion and belonging.
We also believe that diversity across
our workforce makes us stronger
and better able to connect with,
and bring the best of life to,
our residents on a day-to-day
basis. With a variety of thinking
styles, backgrounds, experiences,
perspectives and abilities we are
more able to understand our
residents’ needs and to respond
effectively to them.
Throughout the year our employee
representative groups have had
some significant achievements. Our

Summerset’s Women in
Construction Forum co-chair,
Amanda Robinson, achieved
recognition at the National
Association of Women in
Construction (NAWIC) Awards,

leadership contribution, and who
use their influence and position
to inspire, motivate, and make a
positive difference to their peers.

OUR VILLAGES

Our villages
Despite a challenging year with a slow
property market, inflationary pressures and
weak consumer confidence, we continue to
have strong sales and demand for our desirable
retirement living offering.
In 2024 our build programme has
continued to perform, and we’ve
delivered new homes across 13
villages throughout New Zealand
and added more Australian homes
at our first village there. Even in a very
challenging economic environment
we saw continued demand and
interest, because our residents are
motivated by many factors when
deciding to live in a retirement village
– a desire for more community,
security, health changes, lifestyle
and much more.
Record levels of interest
We experienced strong levels
of demand in our villages with
record sales settlements and
good numbers of presales in
our developing villages. Our
development pipeline remains
strong to meet the growth of
demand for our retirement living
offering around the country.
It was a very busy year for our
sales teams with four new villages
welcoming their first residents in
2024 – Milldale (Auckland) and
Blenheim in January, St Johns
(Auckland) in October, and in
Australia our Cranbourne North
village had their first residents move
in March.

With the completion of village
centre buildings at our Pāpāmoa,
Boulcott and St Johns villages, we
were also able to meet strong
interest and welcome residents
into serviced apartments, care
centres and memory care centres
in those villages.

move-in dates for some prospective
residents. In response, we were
able to activate tactical sales levers,
where needed, to help our residents
to make a move to a Summerset
village. Our use of sales incentives
has not dramatically increased,
staying in line with previous years.

Since introducing care suites sold
under ORA, an alternative to
charging a daily premium rate, the
greater financial certainty of an ORA
which allows residents to use the
equity they have already rather than
having to pay daily charges has been
well received by residents, with sales
exceeding our forecasts.

Our popular moving service
continues to grow and we are proud
to be the only retirement village
provider offering dedicated in-house
moving services to incoming
residents at selected villages in
Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty,
Wellington and the South Island.
This service allows residents to draw
on the expertise of an experienced
Moving Specialist, who provides
support and assistance throughout
the moving journey process. The
service receives overwhelmingly
positive feedback from residents.

Demand across both
our new and resale
villages continues to
be strong and we've
seen robust waitlists
across New Zealand
and Australia.
While demand has been high
and sales strong, in a highly
competitive market with tough
market conditions, the slowdown
in the residential property market
has delayed settlement times and

To support prospective residents
to prepare for their next step
towards retirement village living,
and care, we have delivered
highly successful seminars in local
communities including downsizing
and decluttering, real estate
seminars in which we partner with
local agencies to provide their
expertise and insights. We also
ran three ‘Living with Dementia’
events with local Alzheimer’s New

37

Annual Report 2024

Zealand branches in Pāpāmoa, Bell
Block (New Plymouth), and Te Awa
(Napier). These events have been
very well attended and highly valued.
Flexibility in our
building programme
We have prudently managed our
build rates to align with market
demand and economic conditions.
We have invested approximately
$600 million into our build
programme this year, and we remain
the largest constructor in the New
Zealand retirement village sector.

38

During the year we delivered
676 new homes under ORA
in New Zealand, and have
made significant progress with
construction underway at a
total of 18 villages across ten
regions, including three care centre
refurbishments (Havelock North,
Levin and Trentham), and three
villages in their pre-construction civil
works phase.
Our ability to deliver year-on-year
ensures we are well positioned to
meet continued increases in sector
demand and we expect to deliver

600–650 homes in New Zealand
in FY25.
Construction commenced at our
Rangiora site, and work is
progressing well on our two
lightweight (timber) regional village
centre buildings at our Cambridge
and Whangārei villages.
In Wellington, our Waikanae village
construction team handed over the
‘Rimu Range’ of townhouses, the
second iteration of our very popular
three-bedroom townhouse design.
The townhouses, now built with a
lightweight construction method,
support our commitment to
building with more environmentally
sustainable materials. At Boulcott, in
Lower Hutt, we delivered the village
centre’s administration, recreational
and dining spaces along with the
memory care centre and serviced
apartments at the end of May. These
facilities are further enhanced by the
stunning outlook they have over the
neighbouring golf course towards
the Hutt River.
In Auckland, our Half Moon Bay
village is tracking well against its

build programme with foundation
work starting. Our St Johns village
welcomed its first resident in
October, and was officially opened
by the Prime Minister of New
Zealand, the Rt. Hon. Christopher
Luxon in December.
We have now fully completed
our Summerset on Cavendish
village at Casebrook in Christchurch
and opened the village centre
at Summerset by the Dunes
in Pāpāmoa. The new village
centre, which in addition to
providing our superb range of
recreational amenities for the
village’s residents to enjoy, includes
serviced apartments, care and
memory care centres.
We were pleased that our
work to deliver Summerset on
the Landing in Kenepuru was
this year awarded Gold at
the Master Builders Commercial
Project Awards. This prestigious
awards programme celebrates
collaboration and innovation across
the building industry, and what sets
them apart is that they focus on
recognising the contribution of the

OUR VILLAGES

whole project team, the people who
brought the project to life, rather
than just the building itself.
All our villages under construction
met their year-end delivery targets.
There are a number of reasons
for this achievement, including
excellent project management
teams, robust procurement,
planning and consenting processes,
and designing most of the villages inhouse. We also have long-standing
and reliable supply agreements that
have enabled us to secure materials
well in advance.
We have a very mature procurement
programme and function with
good tender processes returning
better feasibility on build costs
and seeing us through difficult and
uncertain times. We were proud
to celebrate the achievements of
our Procurement team who won
the New Zealand Procurement
Excellence Forum's prestigious
Transformation of the Year Award
in 2024.
Summerset works hard to build
and maintain strong relationships
with our building partners. Our
trusted contractors and potential
new partners were invited to attend
our construction Partner Events,
a strategic initiative to strengthen
these relationships and also position
Summerset as the premier client ‘to
work with and for’. This year we
held events in Auckland, Wellington
and Christchurch with over 250
partner attendees.
Vibrancy and innovation by design
Bringing the best of life to our
residents requires us to build vibrant
villages with superior amenities that
meet the expectations of our current
residents and consider the future
needs of our prospective residents.
It also allows us to differentiate
ourselves from competitors.
Each of our villages contains
landscaped gardens, carefully
planned and designed with a

respectful consideration of its
unique surroundings. They also
contain a range of indoor and
outdoor spaces for our residents,
their families and friends to enjoy.
We're looking at how we can
incorporate additional amenities of
interest to our residents such as
pickleball and croquet courts and
outdoor barbecue areas, and this
year we have installed our first indoor
golf simulator at our Summerset
Down the Lane village in Hamilton.
Some of our building designs have
also had a refresh. Our villa portfolio
is being given a more contemporary
update which we will look to
incorporate in future village plans,
starting with our proposed villages at
Rolleston and Mosgiel.
Our village centre buildings, which
contain resident amenities, care
and administration, have received
both new and refreshed design
allowing us the option to right-size
amenities that are suitable to the
local environment and the needs of
residents in that area.
One of the new design formats will
begin construction next year at our
Blenheim village. This single-storey
building will be in keeping with the
local area but continue to have the
high specifications and amenities
our residents expect. Being single
storey means it is faster to build but
also allows us to create a space that
is very light and airy with exposed
wood and enhanced features.
We’ve also gone further with the
refreshed design of our current
format of three-storey village centre
buildings with a two-storey design.

market there have been some
opportunities for us to find quality
sites with competitive pricing which
will enable us to grow our business
and introduce more New Zealanders
to our retirement village lifestyle.

In New Zealand we
were pleased to have
announced five site
acquisitions this year
in locations of high
demand and forecast
population growth for
those aged 75 years
and older.
Mission Hills in Napier was the first
new village site to be announced.
Complementing our two existing
Napier villages it will be our
fifth village in the Hawke’s Bay
region. Located within the highquality master-planned Mission Hills
subdivision, the elevated site offers
expansive views of the coast and
surrounding rural landscape.
In December we announced a
further two new sites: Belmont,
on Auckland’s North Shore, and
Otaihanga on the Kāpiti Coast north
of Wellington. The 5.7ha Belmont site
will be highly attractive to future
residents being just minutes from
the vibrant areas of Takapuna and
Devonport with diverse shopping
and dining options and an extensive
choice of recreational facilities. The
proposed coastal village will be
generally north-facing and have
some stunning views of the city.
The land was purchased from
Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and the
agreement includes education and
employment opportunities for hapū,
facilitating the start of a longterm partnership.
The Otaihanga site of 12.6 hectares
will be our third village in the area,
with an existing Paraparaumu village
and our newer developing village
in Waikanae which are both in high
demand. The site is handily located
between Paraparaumu Beach and
the Coastlands Mall with a wide

variety of shops and amenities
including major retailers, cafés,
restaurants and boutique shops.
Purchasing land adjacent to our
existing villages is a continued
focus of our development. These
opportunities allow us to meet
demand, and increase the costeffectiveness of our villages, as
we add high-margin independent
units to a village that already has
supporting infrastructure.
This year we purchased a 1.23ha
site for an extension to our
Boulcott (Lower Hutt) village, and
a 4ha site to extend our Blenheim
village. The Boulcott extension is
on the eastern edge of Boulcott's
Farm Heritage Golf Club. We plan
to provide additional independent
living villas and townhouses units as
well as additional village amenities
such as pickleball and another
resident clubhouse.
The Blenheim extension will allow
us to offer up to 100 additional
homes to Marlborough retirees, and
add extra amenities such as croquet
and an outdoor barbecue area to

ensure there is an even wider range
of activities for residents to enjoy.

These major
acquisitions have
added more than 1,100
units to our land bank.
Our pipeline was additionally
bolstered with resource consents
received for Kelvin Grove
(Palmerston North) and Cashmere
Oaks (Masterton) villages, and we
expect to receive fast track approval
for our Rotorua village in Q1 2025.
Our Mosgiel village has also been
included on the Fast-Track Approvals
Act (Schedule 2) as we continue to
have the largest, most diverse and
consented (shovel ready) land bank
in the sector.
Australia progress
We are carefully building
momentum with our Australian
portfolio, and 2024 saw us achieve
some important milestones in
Victoria. These included further

progress at our first village in
Cranbourne North, construction
civils commencing at our second
village of Chirnside Park, holding
a sod turning event before
commencing enabling works at
Torquay, and securing approval for
plans at our Oakleigh South village.
Construction at our Cranbourne
North village is progressing well,
having completed the second stage
of homes with the delivery of 12 villas
in December. We also commenced
the third stage of new homes, and
construction on the village centre
building. When complete this will be
our first village to offer aged care
in Australia, another major milestone
we look forward to achieving in our
growth across the ditch.
In October, we held the opening
of the Cranbourne North Hilltop
Reserve extension - a new park
for the local community that
was designed and constructed by
Summerset as part of our village
development. We are committed
to supporting the growth and
wellbeing of the local communities
in which we develop our retirement

OUR VILLAGES

The sod turning event at our Torquay land in November marked a major milestone for us in Australia

villages, and through local amenity
improvement projects like the
handover of the Hilltop Reserve
extension, we can invest in the social
fabric of the neighbourhoods we
operate in.
We commenced construction civils
at our second village site, Chirnside
Park, in Melbourne’s northeast. First
villa builds are underway with
delivery at the end of 2025 and first
residents are expected to move in Q1
2026. The village is located within
the Chirnside Park town centre
precinct with panoramic views to the
Yarra Valley.
Having gained approval of the
development plan for our coastal
Torquay village early in 2024,
we have now received Council
approval of a planning permit
for up to 290 independent and
assisted retirement units and 80
residential aged care beds. A
smoking ceremony and sod turning
event was held in November
and enabling works commenced
in January 2025. Our Torquay
development will also see the
creation of a large new public park

as well as providing long awaited
upgrades to surrounding streets.
Earlier in 2024 we received
unanimous approval from City of
Monash Council for our plans for
a new village at Oakleigh South
in Melbourne’s inner east. The
village location is surrounded by
two outstanding recreation facilities,
the Metropolitan and Huntingdale
Golf Clubs.
We are building our Australian
capability and resourcing for
operational readiness in a timely
way, including looking forward to
welcoming our first aged care
residents in 2026.

Australia still offers
growth opportunities
for us and we’re
pleased with the
progress we have
made there.
We are focused on finding the right
opportunities to add to our land bank

in Australia. However, we naturally
need to be prudent and disciplined
around what we buy and ensure that
it meets our strict financial and nonfinancial investment hurdles.
We haven’t found the right land
for us in Victoria or Queensland in
2024 but we are confident there
are many great opportunities for
us in the coming years and we
have an existing pipeline of projects
in progress.
We expect to deliver between 50-80
homes to be sold under ORA in
Australia during FY25, including the
village centre at our Cranbourne
North village (which will be delivered
late in FY25 and open to residents
in FY26).

OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY

Our commitment
to sustainability
We are committed to making sustainability a
part of all of our work across our villages,
construction sites and offices in New Zealand
and Australia.
Sustainability is built into
Summerset’s ten-year strategy, and
during FY24 we continued to reduce
our emissions and implement
good environmental, social and
governance (ESG) initiatives.
In February we delivered our second
Sustainability Review which, for
the first time, included our climaterelated disclosures, a requirement
for us under New Zealand law now.
Summerset is a climate reporting
entity under the Financial Markets
Conduct Act 2013. Our latest
Sustainability Review and Climaterelated Disclosures FY24 report is
now available on the Summerset
website at www.summerset.co.nz/
investor-centre/esg-reporting.
This report details the work
we’ve undertaken across our ESG
initiatives during 2024 as well as the
risks and opportunities that climate
change poses for us as a company.
Below is a high-level update on some
key sustainability activities during
2024. Please see our Sustainability
Review for more information.
During 2024 our sustainability work
was recognised by the Retirement

Villages Association (RVA) with
our construction waste avoidance
initiative and our Richmond Ranges
village solar panels installation both
being named finalists for the RVA
Sustainability Awards. We were
named a Sustainability Leader in the
Property & Construction category by
the Australian Financial Review and
we were one of three New Zealand
companies to be awarded an Ethical
and Sustainable Business Award by
Money Matters and Catalyst.
Our emissions profile
Summerset’s total emissions in 2024
were 72,925 tCO2e, an increase
of 64,118 tCO2e compared to
our 2022 base year. This rise is
primarily driven by the reporting
requirements of Scope 3 value chain
emissions, which now form the
largest part of our carbon footprint.
Key contributors within Scope 3
are category 1 capital goods and
2 purchased goods and services,
together accounting for over threequarters of our total emissions,
largely due to our expanding
construction activities.
Electricity and gas are the main
sources of Summerset's Scope 1 and

2 emissions, essential for delivering
high-quality care through heating,
cooking, and laundry services. While
overall emissions in these categories
are expected to rise as we grow and
welcome more residents, emissions
per square metre of developed land
have steadily decreased since 2017.
This progress reflects improvements
in construction, design, operational
efficiencies, and the adoption
of decarbonisation initiatives,
including sourcing renewable
energy certificates.
With most of our greenhouse gas
emissions now in our value chain,
we started work on establishing
our procurement sustainability
programme to work with our
suppliers to drive down our Scope
3 emissions and innovate lower
carbon products and services.
We have commenced our supplier
engagement programme through
national and regional supplier
forums focused on both material
and product suppliers as well as
service providers. We work hard to
build strong relationships with our
suppliers and through this approach
we will successfully encourage

47

Annual Report 2024

our supply chain to continually
improve in line with Summerset’s
sustainability strategy ambitions.
Our new science-based target
Climate science is rapidly
developing and maturing and we
have worked hard to stay current.
We have continually challenged
ourselves to be better and to
find the best ways to hold
ourselves accountable internally
and externally.
Since we began measuring and
reporting emissions in 2018, the
landscape has evolved significantly.
In 2018 we initially set an emissions
reduction target to reduce emissions
intensity per $ million revenue by
5% in five years. We significantly
exceeded that target, achieving a
16% reduction.
48

In 2022, Summerset committed to a
near-term, five-year science-aligned
target to reduce our emissions
intensity by 34% by 2027 for Scopes 1
and 2 and we have been tracking well
against this.
This year, following best practice,
we underwent the rigorous process
of having this target upgraded
and validated by the Science
Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). This
validation ensures our emissions
reduction targets are grounded in
the latest climate science, utilising
standardised methodologies and
independent verification.
Establishing a science-based target
allows us to clearly understand
how much, and how quickly, we
need to reduce our greenhouse
gas emissions to mitigate the worst
effects of climate change.
Our new target is to reduce Scope
1 and 2 GHG emissions by 49%
per square metre by 2028 from
our 2022 base year. We’ve also
committed to engaging our supply
chain in emissions reduction. By
2028, our aim is for more than 70%
of our suppliers, covering purchased
goods, capital goods, fuel, energy,

travel and other key activities, to set
science-based targets.

Richmond, Rototuna, Pāpāmoa and
Boulcott villages.

We are proud to have the latest
science and information driving
us and holding us accountable.
We are confident Summerset
can meet these targets and
continue to improve our emissions
reduction efforts.

This initiative involved installing
1,000+ solar panels across these
sites, generating over 300 MWh
of power.

Measurement and certification
In addition to our science-based
target we take a number of
other steps to hold ourselves
externally accountable.

Measurement
Our Greenhouse gas emissions
(GHG) have been calculated in
accordance with the Greenhouse
Gas Protocol standards. Further
information on how we measure our
GHG emissions is available in the
Metrics and targets section of our
Climate-related Disclosures.
Certification
Along with our science-based target
we are proud to be a Toitū net
carbonzero certified organisation
in line with ISO 14064-1. This
means we’ve measured and offset
emissions from our operations,
including emissions from business
travel, electricity, vehicles and
offices. Further information on our
Toitū net carbonzero certification is
available on the Toitū website.
We recognise that we can’t
reach our sustainability goals
alone. Collaboration is key,
so we work alongside several
organisations that are helping
advance sustainable practice in
New Zealand and worldwide,
including Waste Management, the
Climate Leaders Coalition, Lifemark
and others.
Solar power and electric vehicles
Throughout 2024, we advanced
our commitment to renewable
energy production by completing
the installation of solar panels
on the main buildings of our

Our solar transition
not only enhances
our resilience and
reduces our reliance
on grid electricity
but also significantly
contributes to the
electricity needs of
the common areas in
our main buildings,
which house our
care facilities.
Additionally, in 2024 we introduced
solar-powered streetlights at our
Havelock North, Paraparaumu, and
Palmerston North villages.
We have made significant
strides in promoting sustainable
transportation options for our
residents through the rollout of
electric vehicle (EV) charging
stations and our village EV car
sharing initiative. Over the past year,
we have increased the percentage of
EVs in our own fleet to 12%, up from
5% in 2023.
To support our electric fleet and
enhance the national charging
network, we have been retrofitting
EV charging stations at our
villages and we're ensuring that
all new developments include
charging infrastructure. Residents
are excited about the opportunity
to book village EV cars when
they need them, allowing them
to enjoy the convenience of
electric transportation.

Understanding and minimising
embodied carbon is crucial
in our efforts to combat
climate change and build more
sustainable communities.
To date we have successfully
calculated the upfront embodied
carbon for two of our standard
build typologies, our three-bedroom
townhouse and our standard twobedroom villa. With this information
we’re able to identify opportunities
to reduce embodied carbon
and work towards providing lowcarbon homes.
Since we took this baseline measure,
we have built our second generation
of the three-bedroom townhouses
and seen significant reductions in
embodied carbon. Between design
iterations we have reduced our
upfront carbon emissions by 24%.
This is a great first result and
equally we’re pleased that while
we’ve created far more sustainable
homes, we have been able to do
so without compromising the quality
of construction.
Waste reduction
At Summerset, we are committed
to waste minimisation as a crucial
component of advancing our
circular economy work.

upgrades), and two in Australia, and
reducing our construction waste is
an ongoing focus for the business.
Our hard work resulted in 76% of our
construction waste being diverted
from landfill.
Working with our partners we
are a construction industry leader

OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY

in waste reduction. Our waste
minimisation programme operates
at various levels of the waste
hierarchy, emphasising recycling,
reuse, and diversion, alongside safe
landfill disposal.
Additionally, we ensure the
responsible handling and disposal
of any hazardous materials in
strict compliance with national
and local regulations, as outlined
in our individual site waste
management plans.
Our focus in 2024 has been to
strategically choose sustainable (or
the most sustainable) materials and
optimising their use, collaborating
closely with our suppliers to
reduce waste, increase recycling,
improve efficiency, and invest
in low-carbon technologies while
accessing emissions data.
In our villages, we continually
monitor the effectiveness of our
waste minimisation plans and seek
new opportunities for improvement.
This year, our focus has expanded
to include food waste, identifying
waste or opportunities to improve
waste minimisation during our food
service process.
Two of our villages are participating
in The Food Waste Reduction
Project in Aged Care, conducted
by Otago University, and funded by
the Ministry for the Environment,
which will give us more information
and the tools to help us reduce our
food waste.
During the year we've investigated
the opportunity to further direct
plastic, electronic and hygiene
product waste, and have continued
collaborating with our suppliers on
alternative solutions for hazardous
items, such as batteries.
We’re very pleased with the work
we’ve done to date, and we remain
committed to leading positive
change within our industry.

Sustainability-linked lending
We got our first sustainability-linked
loan in 2021, and since then all
our lending has been sustainability
linked. Having these conditions is
a great way to hold ourselves
accountable while at the same time
incentivising and providing tangible
benefits for the work we’re doing.
When we achieve the sustainability
performance targets we agreed
with our lenders we access more
favourable lending conditions.

During 2024, we
achieved all of our
sustainability-linked
lending performance
targets, resulting in
significant savings on
interest costs.
These targets include emissions
intensity reductions, reducing
construction waste, and
enhancing wellbeing.
More information
As a business we’ll continue our
regular reporting and improving the
activities and initiatives we’re already
undertaking. We are dedicated
to the ongoing investigation and
experimentation with new methods
and technologies that will help us
in achieving our sustainability goals
and ensure we continue to advance
our corporate citizenship in both
New Zealand and Australia.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Summerset has delivered another
year of strong underlying profit
performance and maintained
balance sheet resilience despite a
challenging operating environment.
Financial performance overview
Underlying profit for the year
ended 31 December 2024 increased
by 8% on the prior year to
$206.4 million (2023: $190.3 million),
driven primarily by record new
sales and resales in the year
and the continual growth in our
portfolio which has increased our
DMFs. New sales increased by
28 units on the prior year (+5%)
while resales increased by 107
(+20%), with five villages having 30+
resales for the year. We saw resales
across 31 different villages and
maintained a strong geographical
spread across the country with
only 47% of resales coming from
the Auckland, Wellington and
Christchurch regions.
We increased our delivery of units
compared to 2023 with total
deliveries for the group of 708,
an increase of 10% (643 in 2023)
with 32 Australian units and 676 NZ
units delivered in 2024. Revenue for
the year grew 18% to $319.9 million
(2023: $272.2 million), reflecting
village revenue growth from
deliveries within our developing
villages and continued high rates of
care occupancy in existing villages.
Profits from operations have held
relatively stable, a strong result given
we opened two new care centres
which incur large, fixed start-up
costs while occupancy builds up.
We continue to see wages and
costs increasing at a rate higher
than the increases to public funding,
in particular nurses' wages, council
rates, insurance and power.
Long-term growth
A key component of underlying
profit is the realised development
margin on new sales, which
was $118.4 million in 2024 (2023:

$121.2 million). Although we settled
more new sale units in 2024 (+28
units), our overall development
margin was 28.9%, slightly down on
prior year (31.6%) due to a shift in
mix in new sale settlements where
we saw more needs-based products
settled as well as higher average
costs to build in 2024. We expect
that development margins will be
maintained within the 20–25% range
over the medium term.
Good margins reflect the
advantage of having strong
in-house capabilities for each
stage of village development
including land acquisition, planning,
consenting, design, procurement
and construction management.
We continue to work to manage
cost inflation across our build
pipeline through leveraging from
scale, standardisation and mature
procurement planning.
Summary of sales
and developments
Summerset had another record
sales year, with 1,238 unit sales
of occupation rights (2023: 1,103),
588 of them new unit sales
(10 in Australia) and 650 sales
of existing units. Average gross
proceeds per new sale settlement
of $696,000 was slightly up
from $686,000 in 2023 due to
higher sales prices across all
product types. Realised resale gain
increased by 9% to $95.9 million in
2024. Average gross proceeds per
resale settlement were $581,000,
similar to 2023 of $587,000. Key
development milestones included
the first deliveries of units at St Johns
(Auckland) which also included the
main building. We also delivered
the main building at Pāpāmoa
(Tauranga) and our memory care
centre at Boulcott (Lower Hutt). In
Australia, we delivered a further 32
units at Cranbourne North and saw
our first residents move in.

Net profit after tax
Summerset recorded a net profit
after tax of $339.8 million for
the year ended 31 December
2024, down from $425.3 million in
2023. This year-on-year change
is largely reflective of the fair
value movement of investment
properties recognised in 2024,
relative to 2023. The fair value
movement in 2024 of $372.6 million
included $111.8 million from new
units delivered and $131.7 million
from uplifts to retirement unit pricing
across the year. Early signs of
optimism in the wider property
market gave us confidence to
modestly increase portfolio pricing
as the year progressed and this was
also seen by our external valuers
who lifted unit pricing growth rates
to match expectations of improving
house prices as we move into 2025
and beyond.
53

Business growth and expenses
Summerset derives its revenue
from selling units (DMFs) and
providing village and care services.
Summerset’s revenue increased as a
result of higher volumes, reflective
of the continuing growth and
scale of our operations. DMFs on
Summerset’s units sold under ORA
were $121.4 million in 2024 (2023:
$104.6 million). The gains reflect the
increase in the number, occupancy
and value of Summerset’s portfolio
of units. Underlying profit is a
non-GAAP measure. A detailed
explanation is included in Note 2 to
the Financial Statements (see page
68). In general terms, underlying
profit removes the fair value
movement of investment property
and reinstates the realised gains
associated with our resales and
the development margin associated
with our new sales.
Summerset’s total unit portfolio
reached 7,970 (2023: 7,371), and
at year end there were 547 new
units and 208 resale units available
for sale which represents 9.5% of

Net cash from operating activities
Summerset’s net cash from
operating activities was
$443.2 million for the year, up 11%
from 2023 (2023: $398.2 million).
This was principally driven by
increased receipts from residents
but reduced by increased costs of
providing care and village operations
as our resident numbers grow.
Summerset is a growth company
and reinvests operating cash flows
back into the business to finance
future growth. In 2024 Summerset
invested $683.1 million, primarily
in relation to new and existing
retirement villages and care centres
(2023: $668.5 million).

our total portfolio (2023: 7.7%), the
increase largely due to the high
number of deliveries in Q4 2024.
Occupancy in our mature care
centres was 94% (2023: 93%), which
is above the industry average of 90%.
Total operating expenses were
managed well, increasing by 15% to
$284.1 million in 2024 (2023:
$248.0 million). This increase was
mainly due to the startup costs and
growth in headcount of developing
villages (including opening two main
buildings and one memory care
centre) of approximately $28 million.
Inflationary cost pressures were also
a key driver of the overall increase,
accounting for over $8 million of the
increase, due to higher wage costs
(including increased care wage
costs at a rate above the level of
public funding increases), general
cost growth across head office
functions and higher rates, utilities
and insurance across our properties.

Assets rose to $8.1 billion
Total assets rose 16% to $8.1 billion
at 31 December 2024 (2023:
$6.9 billion), mainly due to growth
in the size and value of Summerset’s
investment property, which reached
$7.3 billion (2023: $6.4 billion). At
balance date, Summerset also had
property, plant and equipment

OUR PERFORMANCE

valued at $602.8 million (2023:
$416.3 million), most of this
being care centres (these are
operated to provide services and
are therefore not included as
investment property). An increased
embedded value of $1.7 billion (2023:
$1.6 billion) demonstrates future
cash that can be generated when
units are resold. Interest-bearing
debt of $1,714.3 million was 21%
of total assets at year end (2023:
$1,393.5 million). The year-end debt
at face value is made up of
$1,134.0 million of bank borrowings
and $575.0 million of retail bonds.
Summerset also has residents' loans
of $2.9 billion (2023: $2.5 billion).
This is in the form of licences paid
by residents under ORAs. These are
repayable when residents vacate
units and the associated occupation
rights are resold.
2024 dividends
Summerset will pay a final dividend
of 13.2 cents per share (cps)
on 27 March 2025, making a
full payout for the 2024 year
of 24.5 cps (2023: 24.5 cps).
Board policy for shareholder
distributions continues to maintain
a payout range of 20–50% of
each year’s underlying profit. The
2024 distribution of $58.3 million
represents 28.2% of underlying
profit ($206.4 million). Summerset
continues to offer shareholders
a dividend reinvestment option,
including a 2% discount to market
share price.

There are no other new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and are not yet effective, that are expected
to have a significant impact on the Group.
During the period, the Group reviewed its cash flows from operating activities disclosure. The Statement of Cash Flows presentation
has been amended to remove the separate disclosure of cash receipts from residents relating to expected deferred management
fees. These are now included in the receipts from residents’ loans categories.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The principal areas of judgement in preparing these
financial statements are described in the following notes:

•

Deferred management fees – Note 4

•

Deferred taxation – Note 7

•

Interest rate swaps – Note 14

•

Leases – Note 16

•

Revenue in advance – Note 4

•

The Group has updated comparative information to reflect the restatement of fair value movements related to care centre
development, previously included in investment property. As a result, the comparative financial information has been restated
to correct the classification of these assets and reallocate fair value movements from the Income Statement to Statement of
Comprehensive Income. This restatement had no impact on Underlying Profit.

Underlying profit

1 The fair values of investment property and property, plant and equipment have been restated as detailed in Note 1 comparative information.

Underlying profit is a non-GAAP measure and differs from NZ IFRS profit for the period. Underlying profit does not have a standardised
meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by other entities.
The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure in addition to IFRS profit to assist readers in determining the realised
and unrealised components of fair value movement of investment property, impairment and tax expense in the Group’s income
statement. The measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures to monitor performance and make investment
decisions. Underlying profit is a measure that the Group uses consistently across reporting periods. Underlying profit is used to
determine the dividend pay-out to shareholders.
68

This statement presented is for the Group, prepared in accordance with the Basis of preparation: underlying profit described below.

Basis of preparation: underlying profit
Underlying profit is determined by taking profit for the period determined under NZ IFRS, adjusted for the impact of the following:
a)

Less fair value movement of investment property: reversal of investment property valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS profit
for the period, which comprise both realised and non-realised valuation movements. This is reversed and replaced with realised
development margin and realised resale gains during the period, effectively removing the unrealised component of the fair
value movement of investment property.

b)

Add impairment of assets and other non-cash items: remove the impact of non-operating one-off items and non-cash care
centre valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS profit for the period. Care centres are valued annually, with fair value gains
flowing through to the revaluation reserve unless the gain offsets a previous impairment to fair value that was recorded in NZ
IFRS profit. Where there is any impairment of a care centre, or reversal of a previous impairment that impacts NZ IFRS profit for
the period, this is eliminated for the purposes of determining underlying profit.

c)

Add realised gain on resales: add the realised gains across all resales of occupation rights during the period. The realised gain
for each resale is determined to be the difference between the licence price for the previous occupation right for a unit and the
occupation right resold for that same unit during the period. Realised resale gains are a measure of the cash generated from
increases in selling prices of occupation rights to incoming residents, less cash amounts repaid to vacated residents for the
repayment of the price of their refundable occupation right purchased in an earlier period, with the recognition point being
the cash settlement. Realised resale gains exclude deferred management fees and refurbishment costs.

d)

Add realised development margin: add realised development margin across all new sales of occupation rights during the
period, with the recognition point being the cash settlement. Realised development margin is the margin earned on the first
time sale of an occupation right following the development of a unit. The margin for each new sale is determined to be the
licence price for the occupation right, less the cost of developing that unit.
Components of the cost of developing units include directly attributable construction costs and a proportionate share of the
following costs:
◦

Infrastructure costs

◦

Land cost on the basis of the purchase price of the land

◦

Interest during the build period

◦

Head office costs directly related to the construction of units

All costs above include non-recoverable GST.
Development margin excludes the costs of developing common areas within the retirement village (including a share of the
proportionate costs listed above). This is because these areas are assets that support the sale of occupation rights for not just
the new sale but for all subsequent resales. It also excludes the costs of developing care centres.
Where costs are apportioned across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the
nature of the cost.
Where a unit not previously sold under occupation right agreement is converted to a unit sold under occupation right
agreement, realised development margin recognised on the new sale of these units includes the following costs:

e)

◦

Conversion costs

◦

A fair value apportionment reflecting the value of the property immediately prior to conversion

Add/(less) deferred tax expense/(credit): reversal of the impact of deferred taxation.

Underlying profit does not include any adjustments for abnormal items or fair value movements on financial instruments that are
included in NZ IFRS profit for the period.

3. Segment reporting
The Group operates in one industry, being the provision of integrated retirement villages. The services provided across all of the
Group’s villages are similar, as are the type of customer and the regulatory environment. The chief operating decision makers, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Board, review the operating results of the Group as a whole on a regular basis. On this basis, the Group
has one reportable segment, and the Group results are the same as the results of the reportable segment. All resource allocation
decisions across the Group are made to optimise the consolidated Group’s result.
The Group continues to proceed with its expansion into Australia with seven sites purchased to date. These sites are currently being,
or will be, developed into retirement villages.
Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora is a significant customer of the Group, as the Group derives care fee revenue in respect of eligible
government subsidised aged care residents. Fees earned from Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora for the year ended 31 December
2024 amounted to $53.0 million (2023: $44.3 million). No other customers individually contribute a significant proportion of the
Group revenue.

4. Revenue
Care fees and village services income are charged to residents on a monthly basis, as agreed, and are recognised over time. A portion
of village services is considered lease income based on the nature of the services provided.
Deferred management fees, which entitle residents to accommodation and the use of the community facilities within the village, are
recognised over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue. The
expected periods of tenure, being based on historical Group averages, are estimated to be seven to eight years for villas, five years for
apartments, three years for serviced apartments and memory care apartments, and two years for care suites. The estimated expected
periods of tenure are unchanged from prior year. Where the deferred management fees over the contractual period exceed the
amortisation of the deferred management fee based on estimated tenure, the amount is recorded as a liability (revenue in advance).
At balance date, the majority of the revenue in advance balance is non-current. Deferred management fees are recognised on a gross
basis in the receipts from residents’ loans section of the statement of cash flows.

Finance costs

Interest expense comprises interest payable on borrowings and is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are capitalised for property, plant and equipment (Note 9), and investment property (Note 11), if they are directly
attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities
to prepare the asset commence and expenditure and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Borrowing costs of $72.4 million (2023: $51.0 million) have been capitalised during the period of construction in the current year. The
weighted average capitalisation rate on funds borrowed representing the borrowing costs of the loans used to finance projects is
5.37% per annum (2023: 5.09% per annum).
Three of the Group's retail bonds are designated in a fair value hedging relationship. Details of fair value hedging are included in
Note 14.

7. Income tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax, calculated using the tax rate enacted or substantively enacted at balance date and
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, except when it relates to
items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the tax expense is recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax expense is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable it will be utilised. Temporary differences for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit, unless they arise from business combination, are not provided for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

(f) Income tax legislation amendments during the period
During the period, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax and Remedial Matters) Act received royal assent on
28 March 2024, with effect from 1 January 2024. This Act removed the ability to claim tax depreciation on non-residential buildings,
resulting in the removal of the tax base on certain buildings for deferred tax. The removal of the tax base has resulted in a $28.9 million
increase to income tax expense and a corresponding increase to the deferred tax liability in respect of property, plant and equipment.

8. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Trade receivables are not significant on an individual
basis and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate, less an
allowance for doubtful debts.

73

Annual Report 2024

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
The allowance for doubtful debts is made up of expected credit losses based on assessment of trade receivables debt at the
individual level for impairment, plus an additional allowance on the remaining balance for potential credit losses not yet identified.
The expected credit losses allowance requirement on the remaining balance has been set at 2%.

9. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes care centres (including memory care apartments and care suites), both complete and under
development, and corporate assets held.
All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
of the asset. The cost of self-constructed care centres includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to
bring the care centres to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest
during the build period and head office costs directly related to the construction of the care centres. Where costs are apportioned
across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
74

Subsequent to initial recognition, care centres, including those under development, are carried at fair value. Fair value measurement
on care centres under construction is only applied if the fair value is reliably measurable. Where the fair value of care centres under
construction cannot be reliably determined the fair value is the cost of work undertaken.
Fair value measurement on completed care centres is carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of the revaluation
less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, since the assets were last revalued. Other
corporate assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Where an item of
plant and equipment is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the income statement is calculated as the difference between the
net sales price and the carrying amount of the asset.
Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence, which is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged
between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction as at the valuation date.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset
previously recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement unless it directly offsets
a previous surplus in the same asset in other comprehensive income. Any accumulated depreciation at revaluation date is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal,
any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings. Independent valuations are
performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the asset’s fair value at the
balance sheet date.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line (SL) basis over the estimated useful life of each item of property,
plant and equipment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are
reassessed at each reporting date.
Major depreciation rates are as follows:
•
•

Buildings (2% to 14% SL)
Motor vehicles (8% to 10% SL)

•
•

Furniture and fittings (7% to 20% SL)
Plant and equipment (7% to 50% SL)

Also included in the buildings category is building fit-out.
Right of use assets are depreciated on an SL basis over the term of their lease. Refer to Note 16.

Annual Report 2024

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Buildings include $78.9 million of care centres under development carried at fair value, which reflects cost due to the proximity of
completion to 31 December 2024 (2023: $38.2 million).
Right of use assets relate to the Group's leased office premises, car park spaces and plant and equipment; refer to Note 16 for
further information.

Classification between investment property and property, plant and equipment
On initial recognition, the Group performs an assessment to determine whether a unit type should be classified as investment
property or property, plant and equipment. The assessment is based on the significance of ancillary services provided to residents
who occupy accommodation under an occupation right agreement. For the purposes of this assessment, the Group considers
that portion of weekly fees that gives rise to a separate performance obligation for the Group, as ancillary services. In addition
to a quantitative assessment, the business model (being the provision of accommodation) is considered when determining the
classification of the property as either investment property or property, plant and equipment. Subsequent reclassification of unit
types between investment property or property, plant and equipment, occur only when there has been a change in use.

Revaluations
An independent valuation to determine the fair value of all building assets related to care centres was carried out as at 31 December
2024 by CBRE Limited ("CBRE NZ"), an independent registered valuer. Valuations are carried out annually.
The Group is unable to reliably determine the fair value of care centres under development at 31 December 2024 and therefore these
are carried at cost.
At 31 December 2023, the Group was able to reliably measure St Johns due to its advanced stage of construction. CBRE valued this
one site using the residual approach where one block was valued as work in progress together with residual land. The value of the
work in progress was calculated as the market value of completed stock less selling expenses, and an allowance for profit and risk,
holding costs, and costs to complete including a contingent sum. This equated to a fair value of $25.9 million at 31 December 2023.
CBRE NZ determines the fair value of care centres (excluding units under occupation right agreement) using an earnings-based
multiple approach and the amount apportioned to goodwill is not recognised. Significant assumptions used in the most recent
valuation are included in the table below:

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
As the fair value of buildings is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised property, plant and
equipment as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolio of care centres (excluding units under occupation right agreement) are the capitalisation rates applied to
individual unit earnings and the market value per care bed. A significant decrease (increase) in the capitalisation rate would result in
a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the market value per care bed would
result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the
entity’s portfolio of units under occupation right agreement, held as property, plant and equipment, are the discount rates and growth
rates. A significant decrease (increase) in the discount rate would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement,
and a significant increase (decrease) in the growth would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Other key
components in determining the fair value of units under occupation right held as property, plant and equipment are the average entry
age of residents and the average occupancy of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the occupancy period of units would result
in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents
would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

10. Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on an SL basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date
that they are available for use. The intangible assets are software and the amortisation rates at 31 December 2024 are between 10%
and 20% SL basis.

11. Investment property
Investment property is held to earn current and future rental income and capital appreciation. It comprises land and buildings,
and associated equipment and furnishings, relating to retirement units and common facilities in the retirement village. Investment
property includes buildings under development, excluding care centres under development which are included in property, plant
and equipment. Initial recognition of investment property is at cost and it is subsequently measured at fair value, with any change in
fair value recognised in the income statement.
The cost of retirement units includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to bring the retirement units
to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest during the build period
and head office costs directly related to the construction of the retirement units. Where costs are apportioned across more than one
asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Land acquired with the intention of constructing investment property on it is classified as investment property from the date
of acquisition.
Depreciation is not charged on investment property.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.

1 The fair values of investment property and property, plant and equipment have been restated as detailed in Note 1 comparative information.

The Group is unable to reliably determine the fair value of the non-land portion of retirement villages under development at
31 December 2024 and therefore these are carried at cost, with the exception of one site due to its advanced stage of construction.
This equates to $569.2 million of investment property (2023: $524.3 million).
The fair value of investment property, including land, as at 31 December 2024 was determined by independent registered valuers
CBRE NZ, Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (“JLL NZ”), CBRE Valuations Pty Limited ("CBRE AU") and Jones Lang LaSalle Australia Pty
Limited ("JLL AU"). The fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on a semi-annual basis, based on market values,
being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing buyer and a
willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and
without compulsion.

79

Annual Report 2024

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
As required by NZ IAS 40 - Investment Property, the fair value as determined by the independent registered valuer is adjusted for
assets and liabilities already recognised on the balance sheet which are also reflected in the discounted cash flow analysis.
To assess the fair value of the Group's interest in each New Zealand and Australia villages, CBRE NZ, JLL NZ and JLL AU have
undertaken a discounted cash flow analysis to derive a present value. The Group's development land has been valued by CBRE NZ,
JLL NZ, CBRE AU and JLL AU using the direct comparison approach.
Near completed stages of St Johns have been valued using the residual approach where a number of blocks were valued as work in
progress together with residual land. The value of the work in progress was calculated as the market value of completed stock less
selling expenses, and an allowance for profit and risk, holding costs, and costs to complete including a contingent sum.
The valuers' view is that central banks around the world have reduced interest rates, after holding rates at elevated levels to combat
inflation. The main concerns now are slowing economic conditions in both China and the US as well as geopolitical instability in
certain regions, particularly the prospect of a wider conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine. With these factors in
mind, the valuers reiterate that their conclusions are based on data and market sentiment as at the date of the valuation and that a
degree of caution should be exercised when relying upon the valuation.
Significant assumptions used by the valuers in relation to the New Zealand and Australian investment property are included in the
table below:
2024

As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are significant and unobservable, the Group has categorised
investment property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
To assess the market value of the Group's interest in a retirement village, CBRE NZ, JLL NZ and JLL AU have undertaken a discounted

1 Adopted value differs to figures in other notes. It is the value of completed units, net of related resident liability. The amount does not include unsold stock, work in progress
or development land.

Other key components in determining the fair value of investment property are the average entry age of residents and the average
occupancy of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the occupancy period of units would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair
value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents would result in a significantly higher
(lower) fair value measurement.

Operating expenses
Direct operating expenses arising from investment property during the period amounted to $78.6 million (2023: $66.5 million).

Security
At 31 December 2024, all investment property relating to registered retirement villages under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are
subject to a registered first mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor to secure the Group’s obligations to the occupation right
agreement holders.

14. Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swaps are initially
recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value on each reporting date. The
fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined based on cash flows discounted to present value using current market interest
rates. The non-current portion of interest rate swaps comprised of $20.5 million in assets (2023: $18.0 million) and $17.2 million in
liabilities (2023: $16.6 million). 51% (2023: 59%) of the Group's interest-bearing loans and borrowings are covered by fixed interest rate
swap agreements.

Cash flow hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its floating rate debt. These interest
rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. When interest rate swaps meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective
portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to reserves are transferred out of reserves and included in the
measurement of the hedged transaction when the forecast transaction occurs. When interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for
cash flow hedge accounting, all movements in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
variable rates and to pay interest at fixed rates (“payer interest rate swap agreements”). These agreements effectively change the
Group’s interest exposure on the principal covered by the interest rate swaps from a floating rate to fixed rates, which range between
0.56% and 4.93% (2023: 0.56% and 4.93%).
At 31 December 2024, the Group had payer interest rate swap agreements in place with a total notional principal amount of
approximately $1,094.1 million, made up of $642.0 million denominated in NZD and $410.0 million in AUD (2023: $874.2 million, made
up of $497.0 million denominated in NZD and $350.0 million in AUD). Of the swaps in place, at 31 December 2024, $715.2 million were
active (2023: $673.4 million).

81

Annual Report 2024

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
The fair value of these agreements at 31 December 2024 is a $11.0 million liability, comprised of $17.5 million of swap liabilities and
$6.5 million of swap assets (2023: asset of $1.9 million, comprised of $11.9 million of swap liabilities and $13.8 million of swap assets).
The agreements cover notional amounts for terms of up to six years.

Fair value hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its fixed rate debt arising from the retail
bonds. The hedge is for the future fair value movements in the retail bonds as a result of market interest rate movements. The Group
has designated $425.0 million of its retail bonds in fair value hedge relationships.
Both the hedging instrument (interest rate swap) and the hedged risk are recognised at fair value. The change in the fair value of both
items offset in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent the hedging relationship is effective. The increase in fair value
of the interest rate swaps of $12.5 million (2023: increase of $10.4 million) has been recognised in finance costs and has been offset
with a similar fair value gain on the retail bonds to leave an ineffective amount in finance costs of nil (2023: nil).
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at fixed
rates and to pay interest at floating rates (“receiver interest rate swap agreements”). At 31 December 2024, the Group had receiver
interest rate swap agreements in place with a total notional principal amount of $425.0 million (2023: $300.0 million). The receiver
interest rate swap agreements in place at 31 December 2024 are being used to manage the fixed interest rate risk on the SUM020,
SUM040 and SUM050 retail bonds.

15. Residents’ loans
Residents’ loans are amounts payable under occupation right agreements. An occupation right agreement confers a right of
occupancy to a villa, apartment, serviced apartment, memory care apartment or care suite. The consideration received on the grant
of an occupation right agreement is allocated to the resident's loan in full. These loans are non-interest bearing and are payable when
both an occupation right agreement is terminated and there has been settlement of a new occupation right agreement for the same
unit and the proceeds from the new settlement have been received by the Group. Residents’ loans are initially recognised at fair value
and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group holds a contractual right to set-off the deferred management fee receivable on termination of an agreement against the
resident's loan to be repaid. Residents’ loans are therefore recognised net of the deferred management fee receivable on the balance
sheet. Deferred management fees are payable by residents in consideration for the supply of accommodation and the right to share
in the use of community facilities. Deferred management fees are paid in arrears, with the amount payable calculated as a percentage
of the resident's loan amount as per the resident's occupation right agreement. Deferred management fee receivable is calculated
and recorded based on the current tenure of the resident and the contractual right to deferred management fee earned at balance
date. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on recognition of deferred management fee revenue.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
16. Leases
The leases to which NZ IFRS 16 applies are the leases of plant and equipment and office premises and car parks occupied by the Group
in New Zealand and Australia. In respect of these leases, a right of use asset is disclosed along with a corresponding lease liability.
The right of use assets are depreciated on an SL basis, while the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments
that are not yet paid, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.
The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months
or less and certain leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as incurred as
a rental expense over the lease term.
Right of use assets primarily relate to the Group's leased office premises and are classified as property, plant and equipment, and lease
liabilities are disclosed as such in the Group's statement of financial position.
When the Group has the option to extend a lease, management uses its judgement to determine whether or not an option would be
reasonably certain to be exercised. Management considers all facts and circumstances, including their past practice and any cost
that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help determine the lease term. Other assumptions and
judgements used by management include calculating the appropriate discount rate.

As a lessor
The Group acts as a lessor under occupation right agreements with village residents, along with a small number of residential rental
properties. The assets leased by the group as a lessor are disclosed as investment property and lease income on occupation right
agreements is generated in the form of deferred management fees and a portion of care fees and village services. The lease term
is determined to be the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue. The Group allocates individual
leases of units to village residents to different portfolios depending on the type of unit. The Group does not have any subleases.

17. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings include secured bank loans and unsubordinated fixed-rate retail bonds.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent
to initial recognition, the borrowings are measured at amortised cost, with any difference between the initial recognised amount and
the redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest rate. Three of the
four retail bonds, SUM020, SUM040 and SUM050, are designated in fair value hedge relationships, which means that any change in
market interest rates results in a change in the fair value adjustment of that debt. SUM030 is not hedged. Transaction costs incurred
in arranging financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant debt instrument.

Security
The bank loans and retail bonds rank equally with the Group’s other unsubordinated obligations and are secured by the following
securities held by a security trustee:
•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is not a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages
Act 2003;

•

a second-ranking registered mortgage over the land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages Act
2003 (behind a first-ranking registered mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor);

•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group member;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the New Zealand- incorporated guaranteeing Group members, but in respect
of which the Statutory Supervisor has first rights to the proceeds of security enforcement against all assets of the registered
retirement villages to which the security trustee is entitled;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group members; and

•

a Specific Security Deed in respect of each marketable security of Summerset Holdings (Australia) Pty Limited, held by
Summerset Holdings Limited.

Covenants
The financial covenants in the Group’s debt facilities, with which the Group must comply include:
a)

Interest Cover Ratio – the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense of not less than 1.75x calculated on a 12-month rolling
basis. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less fair value movement of investment property and deferred management fee income (as
calculated under NZ GAAP) plus net cash from resales and development margin, less/plus other one-off adjustments. Interest
Expense is the total interest and line fee costs (prior to capitalisation) excluding any interest and line fees incurred in relation
to development tranches of bank debt facilities.

b)

Loan to Value Ratio – the ratio of total loans and borrowings shall not exceed 50% of the total property value, where total loans
and borrowings is gross borrowings at face value and total property value is the valuation amount of all properties that have
been externally valued net of resident’s loans plus the cost of all properties not externally valued plus 50% of the costs incurred
to date on developments not complete.

The covenants are tested quarterly at 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December and the Group has complied with all
covenants during the period.

18. Financial instruments
Exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board adopts policies for
managing each of these risks as summarised below.

Categories of financial instruments

Financial assets
All financial assets of the Group are classified at amortised cost except for interest rate swaps and investments, which are classified
as fair value through profit and loss, and those assets that are designated in a hedge relationship.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities except interest rate swaps and retail bonds are classified as liabilities at amortised cost. Refer to Note 17 for detail
on the retail bonds.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a resident or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual
obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk relates to receivables from residents and bank balances. The Group manages
its exposure to credit risk. The Group’s cash is held with its principal banker, with the level of exposure to credit risk considered
minimal, with low levels of cash generally held. Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and funds are placed
with high-credit-quality financial institutions. The level of risk associated with sundry debtors is considered minimal due to the
recoverability of this balance being assessed as high. The Group does not require collateral from its debtors and the Directors
consider the Group’s exposure to any concentration of credit risk to be minimal.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The status of trade receivables is as follows:

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by seeking to obtain the most competitive rate of interest at all times. The Group
has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to provide an effective cash flow hedge against the variability in floating
interest rates. The Group has also entered into other interest swap agreements to reduce interest rate repricing risk in relation to retail
bonds. See Note 14 for details of interest rate swap agreements.
To comply with the Group’s risk management policy, the hedge ratio is based on the interest rate swap notional amount to hedge
the same notional amount of bank loans or retail bonds. This results in a hedge ratio of 1:1. This is the same as used for actual risk
management purposes, and such a ratio is appropriate for the purposes of hedge accounting as it does not result in an imbalance
that would create hedge ineffectiveness.
In these hedge relationships the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
•

a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship;

•

where the hedge instrument has been transacted on a date different to the rate set date of the bank loan or retail bonds, interest
rates could differ; and

•

differences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.

88

Other than these sources, due to the alignment of the hedged risk in the hedged item and hedged instrument, hedge ineffectiveness
is not expected to arise.
At 31 December 2024 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’s
profit by approximately $11.2 million (2023: decrease by $9.4 million) and increase total comprehensive income by approximately
$19.2 million (2023: increase by $16.7 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity
by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk on residents’ loans and related
sundry debtors through the contractual requirements of occupation right agreements, whereby a resident’s loan is repaid only on
receipt of the loan monies from the incoming resident.

The following table sets out the contractual cash flows for all financial liabilities for the Group (including contractual interest
obligations on bank loans and retail bonds):

Residents’ loans
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings

Total

Residents’ loans are non-interest bearing and are not required to be repaid following termination of an occupation right agreement
until receipt of cash for the new resident loan from the incoming resident. Residents' loans are classified as being repayable on
demand, and therefore fully repayable within 12 months, because the Group does not have a right to defer repayment of residents'
loans for at least 12 months after balance date. Based on historical information including estimated periods of tenure as disclosed in
Note 4, it is estimated that $251.7 million (2023: $191.2 million) is expected to become payable in the 12 months following balance date.
To date, cash for new residents’ loans received has exceeded cash to repay residents’ loans, net of deferred management fees.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of the Group's assets, liabilities and financial performance will fluctuate due to changes
in foreign currency rates.
The Group is primarily exposed to currency risk through its subsidiaries in Australia.
The risk to the Group is that the value of the overseas subsidiaries' financial position and financial performance will fluctuate in
economic terms and as recorded in the Group financial statements due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Due to limited activity
in the Australian subsidiaries in 2024, the Group did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange risk.

The fair value of retail bonds is based on the price traded at on the NZX market as at 31 December 2024. The fair value of the retail
bonds is categorised as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using inputs from third parties that are observable, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Based on this, the Company and Group have categorised these financial instruments as Level 2
under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of investments is categorised as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value
Measurement and its fair value is measured using valuation techniques based on discounted future cash flow forecasts and various
unobservable inputs.

Capital management
The Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings. The objective of the Group’s capital management is
to ensure a strong credit position to support business growth and maximise shareholder value. The Group is subject to capital
requirements imposed by the bank lenders (through covenants in the Syndicated Facility Agreement) and bondholders (through
covenants in the Master Trust Deed). The Group has met all of these externally imposed capital requirements for the year ended
31 December 2024 (2023: all requirements met). The Group capital structure is managed, and adjustments are made, with Board
approval. There were no material changes to objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: none).

19. Share capital and reserves
At 31 December 2024, there were 236,825,424 ordinary shares on issue (2023: 234,281,382). All ordinary shares are fully paid and have
no par value. All shares carry one vote per share and carry the right to dividends.

21. Employee share plans
Senior employee share plan - share option scheme
The number of options granted to each participant equals the incentive remuneration value divided by the volume weighted average
price on the NZX during the 10 trading day period. Where applicable, the exercise price of the granted share options is determined
from the volume weighted average price on the NZX during the 10 trading day period determined by the Board prior to the grant.
Effective from the 2021 annual option grant, the option exercise price is set at nil and therefore no option valuation is required.

Options outstanding as at 31 December 2024 have a weighted average remaining life of 2.74 years (2023: 2.46 years).
For the 2024 annual option grant, the following performance hurdles apply to all participants:
92

•

75% of each Tranche will vest based on absolute total shareholder return performance

•

25% of each Tranche will vest based on relative total shareholder return performance

For annual option grants made between 2018 and 2020, while there is a requirement to remain employed by Summerset up to vesting
date, there are no performance hurdles for vesting of share options to senior management team members, other than the members
of the Executive Leadership Team.
For certain one-off option grants outside of the annual option grant process, performance hurdles are set relating to specific
performance milestones for the relevant Participant.
The maximum terms for options granted range between three and six years.
The share option scheme is an equity-settled scheme and measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at
the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate that
the share options will vest. Where applicable, these options were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the option cost
for the year ending 31 December 2024 of $2,978,009 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the Group
for that period (2023: $2,782,606). The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the share options in cash.

All-staff employee share plan
The Group operates an all-staff employee share plan. A total of 2,060 employees participated in the share issue under the plan for the
year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: 1,944 employees). In 2024, the Group contributed $1,000 per participating employee (being
the total value of the shares issued). A total of 179,220 Company shares were issued under the scheme at $11.44 per share (2023:
188,568 shares at $10.27 per share). The shares are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited and vest to participating employees after
a three-year period.
The cost for the year ending 31 December 2024 of $966,000 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the
Group for that period (2023: $891,000).

22. Related party transactions
Refer to Note 21 for employee share plan details.

Transactions with companies associated with Directors
The Group also enters into transactions with other entities that some of the Directors may sit on the board of. These transactions are

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Shareholders of Summerset Group
Holdings Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Summerset Group Holdings Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the
Group”) on pages 58 to 93 which comprise the statement of financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024, and the income
statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended
of the Group, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements including material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 58 to 93 present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial
Reporting Standards.
This report is made solely to the Company's shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company's shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's
shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
94

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of Ethics for Assurance
Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Ernst & Young provides other assurance and remuneration advisory services to the Group. Partners and employees of our firm may
deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. We have no other
relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of
the audit report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to
respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures,
including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Valuation and classification of investment property and freehold land and buildings
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

As disclosed in notes 9 and 11 of the consolidated
financial statements:

To address the key audit matter, we:

•

the Group’s investment property portfolio was valued
at $7,329 million at 31 December 2024 and included
completed investment property and investment
property under development.

•

the Group’s care centre buildings were valued at
$553 million at 31 December 2024. This included
completed care centre buildings operated by the
Group for the provision of care services and care
centres under development.

Independent valuations of all investment property and
completed care centre buildings were carried out
by third party valuers (the Valuers). The valuation
of investment property and care centre buildings is
inherently subjective given that there are alternative
assumptions and valuation methods that may result in
a range of values.

External valuations
•

read the valuation reports and discussed them with
the Valuers. We assessed the valuation approach and
confirmed that this was in accordance with the relevant
accounting standards;

•

tested, on a sample basis, whether property specific
information supplied to the Valuers by the Group
reflected the underlying property records of the
Group; and

•

assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of
the valuers.

Assumptions and estimates
•

Properties which are externally valued are recorded in
the consolidated financial statements based on the value
determined by the Valuers.

held discussions with the Valuers to gain an
understanding of the assumptions and estimates used
and the valuation methodology applied. We also sought
to understand and consider whether any restrictions had
been imposed on the valuation process;

•

Investment property and care centre buildings under
development that are not, in the Group’s view, sufficiently
progressed to enable fair value to be reliably determined
are carried at cost less any impairment.

considered whether the valuation incorporated
appropriate assumptions for a sample of individual
properties to reflect their characteristics, overall quality,
geographic location and desirability as a whole; and

•

engaged our in-house Real estate valuation experts to
challenge the work performed by the Valuers and assess
the reasonableness of the assumptions used based
on their knowledge gained from reviewing valuations
of similar properties, known transactions and available
market data.

Summerset derives revenue from properties it holds in the
form of both deferred management fees and the provision
of services to residents. NZ IAS 40 requires properties to
be classified as an investment property where the revenue
from the supply of ancillary services is insignificant to
the arrangement as a whole. Judgement is required to
assess the significance of ancillary services in this context
and so whether each property is recorded as investment
properties or property, plant and equipment.

Our work over the assumptions focused on the largest
properties within the portfolio and those properties where the
assumptions used and/or year-on-year fair value movement
suggested a possible outlier compared to the rest of the
portfolio and the market data for the sector.
Estimated valuation range
As a result of the judgement involved in determining
valuations for individual properties and the existence of
alternative assumptions and valuation methods, there is a
range of values which can be considered reasonable when
evaluating the independent property valuations used by the
Group. If we identified an error in a property valuation or
determined that the valuation was outside of a reasonable
range, we evaluated the error or difference to determine
if there was a material misstatement in the consolidated
financial statements.
Classification and measurement
We considered management’s assessment of the
classification of each type of property as either investment
property or care centre buildings. This included assessment
against the requirements of the accounting standards,
and where relevant considering the significance of
ancillary services.
We also considered management’s assessment of whether
the fair value of investment property under development
could not be reliably determined.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Disclosures
We considered the adequacy of the disclosures in notes
9 and 11 to the financial statements. These notes explain
the key judgements made in relation to the classification
and valuation of investment property and freehold land
and buildings and the estimation uncertainty involved in
this process.

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the Annual Report, which includes information other than the consolidated financial
statements and auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge
obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based upon the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the entity, for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting
Standards, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
96

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing on behalf of the entity the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the External
Reporting Board’s website: https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards-for-assurance-practitioners/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/.
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Governance
Summerset has adopted the principles below as an appropriate way to demonstrate its commitment to best practice
governance and to provide transparency in the Company’s approach to corporate governance for the benefit of
its shareholders and other stakeholders. These principles are from the NZX Corporate Governance Code issued in
January 2025. Each principle of the NZX Code is set out below with an explanation on how Summerset meets it.
As at 31 December 2024, Summerset considers that it was in full compliance with NZX Listing Rules and the NZX Code.
The Code of Ethics Policy, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines, Whistle Blowing
Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, Modern Slavery Policy and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy can be found on the
Company’s website and internal intranet alongside other governance documents.

Principle 1: Ethical standards
'Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management
accountable for these standards being followed throughout the organisation.'
Ethical standards
The Board maintains high standards of ethical conduct and expects the Company’s employees to act legally and
with integrity in a manner consistent with the policies, guiding principles and values that are in place. These include
the following:
•

Code of Ethics – This sets out the basic principles of legal and ethical conduct expected of all employees and
Directors. The Company encourages open and honest communication by staff about any current or potential
problem, complaint, suggestion, concern or question.

•

Diversity and Inclusion Policy – This policy outlines the Company’s guiding principles for diversity and inclusion.
Refer to Principle 2 for further details.

•

Securities Trading Policy – In accordance with the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, the NZX Listing Rules and
the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, Directors and employees of the Company are subject to limitations on
their ability to buy or sell Company shares.

•

Whistle Blowing Policy –This policy encourages employees to come forward if they have concerns regarding
serious wrongdoing, and ensures that employees have access to a confidential process in which they can report
any issues in relation to serious wrongdoing without fear of reprisal or victimisation.

•

Supplier Code of Conduct and Modern Slavery Policy – These documents set out the minimum standards
expected of Summerset’s suppliers and support Summerset’s commitment to sustainable, ethical and
inclusive procurement.

•

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy – This policy sets out Summerset’s zero-tolerance approach to bribery and
corruption. It also makes clear that donations to political parties are not permitted.

•

Code of Conduct – This policy sets out the expected behaviours while in employment with the Company.
Company employees are expected to act honestly, conscientiously, reasonably and in good faith, while at all times
having regard to their responsibilities, the interests of Summerset, and the welfare of our residents and staff.

•

Gift Policy – This policy governs the acceptance and reporting of benefits given to staff by third parties.

•

Conflicts of Interest – Summerset's Code of Ethics outlines the standards of integrity, professionalism and
confidentiality to which all employees and Directors of the Company must adhere with respect to their work and
behaviour. To maintain integrity in decision-making, each Director must advise the Board of any potential conflict
of interest if such arises. If a conflict of interest exists, the Director concerned will have no involvement in the
decision-making process relating to the matter.

•

Interests Register – In accordance with the Companies Act 1993 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013,
the Company maintains an Interests Register in which all relevant transactions and matters involving the Directors
are recorded.

Annual Report 2024

Principle 2: Board composition and performance
'To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience
and perspectives.'
Role of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is elected by shareholders and has responsibility for taking appropriate steps to protect and
enhance the value of the assets of the Company in the best interests of its shareholders. The Board has adopted
a formal Board Charter detailing its authority, responsibilities, membership and operation. The key responsibilities
of the Board include setting the overall direction and strategy of the Company, establishing appropriate policies
and monitoring performance of management. The Board appoints the CEO and delegates the day-to-day operating
of the business to them. The CEO implements policies and strategies set by the Board and is accountable to it.
The Board also has responsibility for ensuring the Company’s financial position is sound, and financial statements
comply with generally accepted accounting practice, and that the Company adheres to high standards of ethical and
corporate behaviour.
A summary of the Board protocols is as follows:

98

•

A majority of the Board should be Independent Directors as defined in the NZX Listing Rules

•

The Chair of the Board should be independent

•

The Chair and the CEO should be different people

•

Directors should possess a broad range of skills, qualifications and experience, and remain current on how best to
perform their duties as Directors

•

Information of sufficient content, quality and timeliness, as the Board considers necessary, will be provided by
management to allow the Board to discharge its duties effectively, and

•

The effectiveness and performance of the Board and its individual members should be re-evaluated on an
annual basis.

Directors receive an induction upon appointment to the Board to ensure their full knowledge of the Company and the
industry in which it operates. The Directors are expected to keep abreast of changes and trends in the business and
to keep up to date to ensure they best perform their duties as Directors of the Company.
All Directors have been issued letters setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment.
Delegation of authority
The Board delegates to the CEO responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy and for managing the Company’s
operations. The CEO and management have Board-approved levels of authority and, in turn, sub-delegate authority
in some cases to direct reports. This is documented in the Delegated Authority Policy.
Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution and the NZX Listing Rules, Directors are required to retire three years
after their appointment or at the third Annual Shareholder Meeting following their appointment (whichever is later).
Directors who have been appointed by the Board must also retire at the next Annual Shareholder Meeting following
their appointment.
The Board Charter states that it is not generally expected that a non-executive Director would hold office for more than
ten years or be nominated for more than three consecutive terms. The Board Charter also provides that Directors may
accept other board appointments only where that does not detrimentally affect their performance as a Director of
Summerset. In making this assessment, the number and nature of a Director’s other governance roles may be relevant.
Directors may offer themselves for re-election by shareholders each year at the Annual Shareholder Meeting.
Procedures for the appointment and removal of Directors are also governed by the Constitution.
The People and Culture Committee identifies and nominates candidates to fill Director vacancies for Board approval.
Information about candidates for election or re-election is included in the Notice of Meeting to assist shareholders in
deciding whether or not to elect or re-elect the candidate.

Board composition
The Company’s Constitution prescribes that the Board must comprise a minimum of three Directors, with at least
two Directors ordinarily resident in New Zealand. As at 31 December 2024, the Board comprised seven non-executive
Independent Directors. In determining whether a Director is Independent, the Board has regard to the NZX Listing
Rules and factors described in the NZX Code.
The Company’s Directors derive a portion of their annual revenue from the Company, including via director fees
and distributions. Having regard to the professional nature of their role, the likely opportunity to seek replacement
roles, and the financial position of the Directors, the Board on balance does not consider that the receipt of director
fees and distributions is sufficiently material to outweigh collectively the other factors relevant to the assessment of
independence under the NZX Code.
The Board considers all current Directors to be Independent in that they are not executives of the Company and do
not have a direct or indirect interest or relationship that could reasonably influence (or be perceived to influence), in
a material way, their decisions in relation to the Company.
As at 31 December 2024, the non-executive Independent Directors were Mark Verbiest (Chair), Dr Andrew Wong,
Gráinne Troute, Fiona Oliver, Dr Marie Bismark, Stephen Bull and Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley.
Andrea Scown is a Future Director under the Institute of Directors’ Future Directors programme, which aims to develop
New Zealand’s next generation of directors and provide experience in large companies around the country. Andrea
joined the Board as a Future Director in November 2022. Future Directors fully participate in all Board matters but do
not have voting or decision rights.
The Board comprises Directors who have a mix of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity to adequately meet and
discharge its responsibilities and to add value to the Company through efficient and effective governance leadership.
The current Directors have a varied and balanced mix of skills relevant to the Group’s operations. A summary of the key
skills and experience held across the Board as at 31 December 2024, is set out in the table on the following pages.
More information on the Directors, including their interests, qualifications and security holdings, is provided on our
website and in the Disclosures sections of this report. As a term of their appointment, Directors are required to acquire
and hold shares in the Company to the value of one year’s worth of Director fees, though the Board has the ability to
waive this requirement and would do so in the appropriate circumstances. They have two years in which to acquire the
shares. Once this requirement has been achieved, it is deemed satisfied and is not affected by future fluctuations in
share price. This shareholding requirement may be satisfied by a Director holding shares through an associated person
or entity.
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings. The Directors generally receive material for Board meetings five working
days in advance, except in the case of special meetings, for which the time period may be shorter owing to the urgency
of the matter to be considered.
The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings, and in this capacity is accountable directly to the Board, through
the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board.
All Directors have access to the Executive Leadership Team to discuss issues or obtain information on specific areas
in relation to items to be considered at Board meetings or other areas as considered appropriate. Key executives and
managers are invited to attend and participate in appropriate sessions at Board meetings. Directors have unrestricted
access to Company records and information.
Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice relating to the affairs of the Company or other
responsibilities. Prior approval of the Chair is required before seeking such advice and Directors are expected to ensure
that the cost of such advice is reasonable.

Diversity and inclusion
The Company and its Board are committed to a workplace culture that promotes and values diversity and
inclusiveness. This is outlined in the Company’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which is available on the
Company’s website.
Diversity is defined as the characteristics that make one individual different from another. Diversity encompasses
gender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, physical capability, family responsibilities, education, cultural
background and more.
Inclusion is defined as a sense of belonging, respecting and valuing all individuals, providing fair access to opportunity,
and removing discrimination and other barriers to involvement. The Board recognises that inclusion leads to a better
experience of work for Summerset’s employees, makes teams stronger, leads to greater creativity and performance,
contributes to a more meaningful relationship with residents, their families and stakeholders, and ultimately increases
value to shareholders.
The Board believes that diversity across the workforce makes Summerset stronger and better able to connect with,
and bring the best of life to, residents on a day-to-day basis. When there is a variety of thinking styles, backgrounds,
experiences, perspectives and abilities, employees are more able to understand residents’ needs and to respond
effectively to them.
The Diversity and Inclusion Policy states that its is to: leverage diversity as a competitive advantage, develop
inclusiveness as a core capability for our leaders and people and continually recognise the individual and team
contribution made towards creating a diverse and inclusive work environment.
To help Summerset's leaders lead their increasingly diverse and multi-cultural teams and support diversity and
inclusion the Company offers a Creating an Inclusive Workplace training programme for all managers. The programme
helps leaders to deepen their understanding of others and create an inclusive team environment where all team
members feel valued, appreciated, and can contribute to bringing the best of life for residents.
102

Summerset also supported the establishment of employee representative groups including the Summerset Pride
Network, and continued work of the Women in Construction Forum. Both groups aim to seek equity and inclusion
through building awareness of the challenges, celebrating the successes, and supporting the ideas of these groups.
Each year the Board reviews and assesses performance against the financial year objectives. The Board considers that
for the year ended 31 December 2024, the objectives for achieving diversity have been met.
As at 31 December 2024 (and 31 December 2023 for the prior comparative period), the mix of gender of those
employed by the Company is set out in the table below. The Executive Leadership Team comprises the CEO, the
CFO and all other Executives who report to the CEO. These figures include permanent full-time, permanent part-time,
fixed-term and casual employees, but not independent contractors.

Board performance
The Board is committed to evaluating its performance on a regular basis, generally with a formal, external review
biennally and an internal self-review each intervening year. The process, including evaluation criteria, is considered by
the People and Culture Committee and approved by the Board.
Executive Leadership Team performance
The Board evaluates the performance of the CEO annually. The CEO reviews the performance of direct reports, and
reports to the Board on those reviews. The evaluation is based on criteria that include the performance of the business
and the accomplishment of longer-term strategic objectives. It may include quantitative and qualitative measures.
During FY24 performance evaluations were conducted in accordance with this process.

Principle 3: Board committees
'The Board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining
Board responsibility.'
Board committees
The Board has four standing committees: Audit and Risk Committee, People and Culture Committee, Clinical
Governance Committee, and Development and Construction Committee. Each committee operates under a charter
approved by the Board, and any recommendations they make are to the Board. The charter for each committee is
reviewed annually. All Directors are entitled to attend committee meetings.
Audit and Risk Committee
While the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting rests with the Board,
the Company has in place processes to ensure the accurate presentation of its financial position. These include:
•

An appropriately resourced Audit and Risk Committee operating under a written charter, with specific
responsibilities for financial reporting and risk management;

•

Review and consideration by the Audit and Risk Committee of the financial information and preliminary releases
of results to the market, before making recommendations to the Board;

•

A process to ensure the independence and competence of the Company’s external auditors and a process to
ensure their compliance with the Company’s External Audit Independence Policy (available on the
Company’s website);

•

Responsibility for appointment of the external auditors residing with the Audit and Risk Committee;

•

Monitoring by the Audit and Risk Committee of the strength of the internal control environment by considering
the effectiveness and adequacy of Summerset’s internal controls, reviewing the findings of the external auditor's
review of internal control over financial reporting, and being involved in setting the scope for the internal
audit programme;

•

Ensuring that management has established a risk management framework and monitoring the Company’s risk
profile and reporting of risk, including new and emerging sources of risk (including climate risk).

One of the main purposes of the Audit and Risk Committee is to ensure the quality and independence of the external
audit process. The Committee makes enquiries of management and the external auditors so that it is satisfied as to the
validity and accuracy of all aspects of the Company’s financial reporting. All aspects of the external audit are reported
back to the Audit and Risk Committee and the external auditors are given the opportunity at Committee meetings to
meet with Directors.
The Audit and Risk Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors, the majority of whom must be
Independent. The Committee is chaired by an Independent Director who is not the Chair of the Board. The Committee
currently comprises Fiona Oliver (Chair), Mark Verbiest, Gráinne Troute, Stephen Bull and Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley.
The Audit and Risk Committee generally invites the CEO, CFO, GM Finance, internal auditors and external auditors
to attend meetings. The Committee also meets and receives regular reports from the external auditors without
management present, concerning any matters that arise in connection with the performance of their role.

103

Annual Report 2024

•

Overseeing the process of the Board’s annual performance self-assessment and the performance of the Directors;

•

Assisting the Board in establishing remuneration policies and practices, and setting and reviewing the
remuneration of the Company’s CEO, Executive Leadership Team and Directors; and

Principle 4: Reporting and disclosure
'The Board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance
of corporate disclosures.'
Making timely and balanced disclosures
The Company is committed to promoting shareholder confidence through open, timely and accurate market
communication. The Company has in place procedures designed to ensure compliance with its disclosure obligations
under the NZX and ASX Listing Rules. The Company’s Market Disclosure and Communications Policy sets out the
responsibilities of the Board and management in disclosure and communication, and procedures for managing
this obligation.
Copies of key governance documents, including the Code of Ethics, Securities Trading Policy and
Guidelines, Board and Committee Charters, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Board and Executive Remuneration
Policy, and Market Disclosure and Communications Policy are all available on the Company’s website
at www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/governance-documents.
Non-financial disclosures, such as the Company’s approach to health and safety, our people, the community and the
environment are included within this Annual Report and in our separate Sustainability Review and Climate-Related
Disclosures FY24 document available at www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/esg-reporting/.

Principle 5: Remuneration
'The remuneration of Directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.'
Remuneration of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team is reviewed by the Board’s People and Culture
Committee. Its membership and role are set out under Principle 3. The Committee makes recommendations to the
Board on remuneration packages, keeping in mind the requirements of the Board and Executive Remuneration Policy.
The level of remuneration paid to the Directors and the Executive Leadership Team will be determined by the Board.
However, Directors’ fees must be within the limits approved by the shareholders of the Company.
Further details on remuneration are provided in the Remuneration section of this Annual Report (page 114).

CONSEQUENCES

The Board is responsible for overseeing the management of risks across Summerset’s business. Summerset
has robust risk management and reporting frameworks in place, whereby material business risks are regularly
identified, monitored and managed. The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s
risk management framework and compliance with that framework. Key risks are regularly reported to the Board,
together with Summerset’s approach to risk management. Summerset's Risk Management Policy and Enterprise Risk
Framework are consistent with best practice principles set out in ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard.
The members of Summerset’s Executive Leadership Team are required to regularly identify the major risks affecting
the business, record them in the Risk Register (which identifies the likelihood and consequence of each risk to
Summerset’s business), and develop structures, practices and processes to manage and monitor these risks.
Summerset has a co-sourced model for internal audit and an in-house Risk and External Reporting Manager. As part
of the co-sourced model, Summerset has engaged KPMG as its partner to assist with carrying out internal audit
work on various parts of the Group’s operations, and all major risk and internal control issues are reported on at each
Board meeting.
Health and safety (including in relation to risks, performance and management) is discussed regularly at Board
meetings, and specific reviews are sought as required. Monthly reporting is prepared and used to assist in risk
management, covering areas such as health and safety incidents, injury and near-miss frequency rates, and actions
undertaken. Further information is covered in the health and safety section of this Annual Report on page 33.
Summerset has a Tax Governance Policy in place, which sets out its tax risk management objectives, tax reporting
requirements to the Audit and Risk Committee, and policies and processes to manage tax risk. This Tax Governance
Policy is reviewed by the Board every two years. The Board is satisfied that Summerset has effective policies and

processes in place to ensure the Company is meeting its obligations. Summerset adopts a risk-averse stance in relation
to tax issues and, where possible, seeks certainty on tax positions through proactive engagement with tax authorities.
Summerset's key strategic risks reported to the board are captured below:
•

Cybersecurity – A cyber-attack may lead to data privacy breaches, loss of integrity/availability of information
or of a control system and business disruption potentially resulting in financial loss or reputational damage
or regulatory action. Summerset actively monitors and manages these risks through its risk management and
reporting frameworks.

•

Clinical care – This is a high-risk area for Summerset, which requires constant monitoring, management and policy
review. Good training and professional development, retention of staff, and investment in health and safety all help
mitigate risk in this area. The increasing level of investment required in this area is likely to affect care profitability.

•

Health and safety – The health, safety and wellbeing of its people and residents remain a top priority of
the Company and require systematic approach and strategic focus to ensure continued compliance with
relevant legislation.

•

Capital management – Summerset must manage capital adequately considering local and global
macroeconomic drivers (such as housing market delivery, equity markets, inflation and supply chain) to minimise
any potential negative impact to Summerset or our capacity to operate and provide appropriate returns
for shareholders.

•

Resident care and customer experience – Providing top-level resident and customer experience at all times is a
challenge due to the nature of the organisation. Summerset has various methods in which it manages and monitors
these issues closely, including move-in surveys, ongoing resident feedback surveys, close one-on-one feedback
sessions, and close contact with residents, families, next of kin and prospective residents.

•

Executing Australian growth – Scaling and managing the ongoing growth of the Australian business and
associated business risks. Summerset is mitigating risks through having established a local team, entering a
well-researched market, and developing product and service offerings, procedures and processes tailored for the
new market. Progress in Australia is under close management oversight and has tracked well to date.

•

Regulatory environment – Summerset operates within multiple regulatory environments and additionally as a
listed company has additional societal and investor expectations in relation to corporate governance and ESG
impact of the organisation. Both regulatory change and failure to comply can potentially have negative impact on
Summerset (including financial, reputationally, and operationally). Summerset proactively engages in regulatory
change processes and takes steps to ensure compliance with existing legislation and future amendments
once confirmed.

•

People capability – For Summerset to successfully deliver on our strategy and continue bringing the best of life
to our residents, Summerset must ensure that our people capability continues to meet the required needs of the
organisation but is also able to change and adapt in the future as required. Key areas monitored include nursing
teams and construction.

Other key areas of risk include but are not limited to:
•

Diversity and inclusion – While the Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and annual plans fulfil all of Summerset's
obligations in this area and the Company continues to improve its culture, there is always some level of risk,
particularly in a tight labour market. This will continue to be monitored regularly through staff surveys and
employees being actively engaged in this area. Page 102 provides more information on the Company's Diversity
and Inclusion Strategy.

•

Climate change – Summerset expects to operate in a climate that will progressively experience more acute
challenges and risks arising from increasing climate variability. This is likely to have various impacts on the longerterm plans and operation of the Group – specifically in relation to the design, build and construction of villages, as
well as in the provision of care services to frail residents and the overall lifestyle satisfaction enjoyed in Summerset’s
villages. For more information on how Summerset is managing climate change risks and opportunities please
review our Sustainability Review and Climate-related Disclosures FY24 found at www.summerset.co.nz/investorcentre/esg-reporting/

•

Strategy and innovation – There is a moderate risk with regard to Summerset’s strategic direction and ability
to continue to innovate. Summerset’s intention is to stay at the forefront in all areas of its business, including
technology, design, development and care. Summerset fosters a culture of continuous improvement and invests
in innovation through a programme that enables the Company to anticipate and respond to changes.

107

Annual Report 2024

•

Construction and development – Summerset faces construction and property development risks when
developing new villages. These risks include project delays, default risk, governance and design risk, and potential
labour and materials shortages.

•

Reputation – Summerset operates in a sensitive market involving care of vulnerable members of society.
Summerset’s performance and reputation could be adversely impacted if it suffers adverse publicity, particularly
in respect of care or health and safety issues.

Principle 7: Auditors
'The Board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.'
The Board’s relationship with its auditors, both external and internal, is governed by the Audit and Risk Committee
Charter, External Audit Independence Policy and the Internal Audit Charter. These charters and policies set out the
types of engagements that can be performed by the external and internal auditors. The Audit and Risk Committee
actively monitors the amount of any non-audit work completed by the external auditor to ensure that independence
is maintained.
The external auditor attends the Company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting and is available to answer questions from
shareholders in relation to the external audit.
Ernst & Young was first appointed as external auditor of Summerset in 2004 and is Summerset’s external auditor for
FY24. In 2017, a full tender for the external audit services was completed and Ernst & Young was reappointed through
this process. The lead audit partner changed in 2023, with the appointment of Sam Nicolle. Due to the length of Ernst
& Young’s tenure, Summerset conducted a tender process for its external audit services over the course of 2024. As
a result of this process, PwC has been appointed as external auditor for financial years from 2025 onwards.
108

KPMG was appointed in the role of internal auditor of the Company in December 2016. With the establishment of a
co-source model approach to internal audit in 2020, it currently remains the Company's co-source partner. The internal
audit role is governed by the Internal Audit Charter, which states the objectives and scope of internal audit activities.
The primary objective of internal audit is to increase the strength of the Company’s control environment. This is guided
by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Company. The internal audit assists the Company
in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the
effectiveness of its governance, risk management and internal controls. The Internal Audit Programme is set annually
by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Internal Audit Charter sets out the scope of internal audit activities and this encompasses, but is not limited
to, objective examinations of evidence to provide independent assessments on the adequacy and effectiveness of
operations, governance, risk management and control processes for Summerset. This includes evaluating whether:
•

The actions of Summerset’s officers, directors, staff, and contractors comply with Summerset’s policies,
procedures and applicable laws, regulations and governance standards;

•

The results of operations or programmes are consistent with established goals and objectives;

•

Operations or programmes are being carried out effectively and efficiently, with adequate internal controls;

•

Established processes and systems enable compliance with the policies, procedures, laws and regulations that
could significantly impact Summerset;

•

Information and the means used to identify, measure, analyse, classify and report such information arereliable and
have integrity; and

•

Resources and assets are acquired economically, used efficiently and protected adequately.

Principle 8: Shareholder rights and relations
'The Board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders
that encourage them to engage with the issuer.'
Respecting the rights of Shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that its shareholders understand its activities by communicating effectively with them
and giving them ready access to clear and balanced information about the Company.

To assist with this, the Company’s website is maintained with relevant information, including copies of presentations
and reports. The Company’s key corporate governance policies are also included on the website.
The Company’s major communications with shareholders during the financial year include its Annual and Half Year
Reports and the Annual Shareholder Meeting. The reports are available in electronic and hardcopy format.
Communicating with Shareholders
The Company welcomes communication and feedback from shareholders. The Company’s investor centre (on its
website) provides a Company phone number and email address for communications from shareholders and investor
relations enquiries. All shareholder communications are responded to within a reasonable timeframe.
The Company provides options for shareholders to receive and send communications electronically, to and from both
the Company and its share and bond registrar. The Company’s investor centre includes contact details for MUFG
Pension & Market Services, through which all Company shares and bonds are managed.
Shareholder voting rights
Shareholders have the right to vote on major decisions as required by the NZX Listing Rules. Further information on
shareholder voting rights is set out in the Company’s Constitution.
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings are sent to shareholders and published on the Company’s website
at least 20 working days before the relevant meeting.

Annual Report 2024

Remuneration
Remuneration overview
Report from the Chair
Dear shareholders
As Chair of the Board's People and Culture Committee I am pleased to present Summerset's 2024
Remuneration report.
Remuneration objectives
Summerset’s purpose is to "Bring the Best of Life" to our residents, and the Board is aware that in order to achieve
this we need motivated employees performing at a consistently high level. Our objective is that reward outcomes
for executive and senior leaders are aligned with outcomes experienced by shareholders, and a competitive and
affordable remuneration structure that is equitable and attractive is an important contributory factor for maintaining
this high level of employee engagement. Shareholders will note that these remuneration objectives are consistent with
those detailed in last year’s report.
We recognise that how we manage and reward our employees is a reflection of our broader goals for creating an
inclusive workplace and diverse workforce. In light of this, we have commenced reporting our gender pay gap (GPG)
this year and the Board is committed to better understanding the drivers of this pay gap and closing it for both gender
and ethnic pay over time.
114

Summerset's executive remuneration is set in accordance with the principles laid out in the People and Culture
Committee Charter (available at: https://www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/governance-documents/). We
continue to independently benchmark fixed annual remuneration for the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) to a
peer group of companies of similar size, scale and complexity, while also being cognisant of factors such as incumbent
experience, capability and performance. Our aim is to create a balance between competitiveness (which supports our
ability to attract and retain talent) and affordability for the business.
CEO remuneration
Although not evident in this FY24 report, we advise that the Board has made a further adjustment to Scott Scoullar’s
remuneration to take effect 1 January 2025.
Summerset’s consolidated position within the NZX20, market capitalisation, maturity as a business and growth in
Australia (alongside Scott’s tenure and performance) resulted in the need to align our CEO pay more closely with that
of New Zealand’s top 20 listed companies.
The Board also referenced comprehensive executive remuneration survey data provided by independent external
consultants, benchmarking Summerset's remuneration against New Zealand private sector companies, including
those in the NZX20, as well as relevant companies within the aged care, property management, development, and
construction sectors.
Incentive schemes
Over the course of 2021–2023, Summerset made a number of changes to both our STI and LTI programmes to better
align our Executive and senior leaders to shareholder interests.
Through 2024, we continued to make minor refinements to our incentive plans to better align the STIs for employees
below Executive level to company performance. We have also reviewed the eligibility of our schemes to deliver market
alignment and improve equitable outcomes for our employees in line with our diversity, equity and inclusion goals.
The design of these schemes remains market-aligned, and the focus for 2025 will be to further embed employee
understanding of these schemes to ensure their priorities and performance align to those of the Company.
In addition, for 2025 we will align the Chief Executive’s STI to be solely based on the performance scorecard for
the Company, removing individual performance from any STI earned on the basis that CEO performance outputs
intrinsically align with and drive Summerset's performance outcomes.

Consistent with market practice, we have also aligned our vesting cycle for LTIs for all employees to a one-time
three-year vest. Previously, each LTI plan vested at 50% after three and four years.
In parallel with this change, we plan to encourage a minimum shareholding requirement for our Executive team during
the course of 2025. Our Chief Executive already has a minimum shareholding requirement in place and given his
tenure, has exceeded this requirement.
Executive KPIs
The 2024 shared key performance indicators (KPIs) took a balanced scorecard approach with financial, customer and
staff related KPIs. The performance outcomes have been strong with our financial performance exceeding target.
These KPIs were all stretch targets, and it’s a testament to the strength of the Executive Leadership Team, and their
people, that they have continued to achieve so highly in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The Executives'
achievements against their individual, role-specific KPIs were also very strong.
Board fees
Following external benchmarking data, obtained by PwC and following Shareholder approval at the April 2024 Annual
Meeting (Resolution 3), we also increased the total Directors fee pool to $1,010,000 and made adjustments to the
standard fees as set out in that resolution. No futher changes will be made to the fee pool for 2025.

Gráinne Troute
Chair People and Culture Committee

Remuneration governance
The Board is assisted in delivering its responsibilities and objectives for Executive remuneration by the People and
Culture Committee. The role and membership of this committee is set out in the Governance section of this report.
The People and Culture Committee reviews the annual performance and remuneration outcomes for all Executive
Leadership Team members, including the CEO. The review takes into account external benchmarking to ensure
competitiveness with comparable market peers, along with consideration of each individual’s performance, skills,
expertise and experience.
The Committee operates under a written Charter, which outlines its responsibilities and processes as outlined in
the charter.
The charters and guidelines can be found in the Governance documents section of the Summerset website at
https://www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/governance-documents/
•

People and Culture Committee Charter
The Remuneration Policy is the internal governance policy that provides context for the Executive members’
remuneration outcomes

•

Board and Executive Remuneration Policy
The Board approves the Executive Team annual performance objectives, company financial performance targets
and outcomes on an annual basis.

•

Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines
Summerset’s Securities Trading Policy ensures that Summerset and its subsidiaries’ Directors, senior managers,
employees, contractors and secondees comply with the law prohibiting insider trading and that all dealings in
Summerset securities and other financial products are beyond reproach.

115

Annual Report 2024

Executive Remuneration Policy
The remuneration of members of the ELT (CEO and direct reports) is designed to promote a high-performance culture
and to align executive reward to the development and achievement of strategies and business objectives that create
sustainable value for shareholders. Total remuneration is made up of three components: fixed remuneration, STI
and LTI.
The People and Culture Committee considers external and independent remuneration market information provided
by expert consultants, such as EY and PwC, in order to gauge actual and forecast movements within the market, and
to assess the levels of fixed and target total remuneration to pay its Chief Executive and Executive Team to support
talent attraction and retention.
Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of a base salary and benefits including a company contribution of 3% for Kiwisaver. Other
benefits are elective and the value of each is deducted from fixed annual remuneration.
Short-term incentives
STIs are at-risk payments designed to motivate and reward performance, typically in that financial year. The Chief
Executive, Executive Team, and certain other senior members of staff may participate in the STI scheme. The STI
opportunity within total remuneration reflects the complexity and level of the roles. In FY24 the Chief Executive had
a target STI opportunity of 45% of fixed annual remuneration, and the other Executives had a target STI opportunity
of 30%.
A proportion of the STI (80% for CEO and 70% for the other Executive Leadership Team members) was related to
achievement of annual business performance metrics, which aim to align executives to a shared set of KPIs based on
business priorities for the annual performance period. Target areas for the shared KPIs for 2024 are outlined below:

1 On-target performance results in a payment of 100% of the target bonus opportunity for this performance hurdle.

The Board can reduce or cancel STI payments if there are concerns around health and safety or clinical performance.
There are three performance levels within each target area along with a performance hurdle or gate opener which
needs to be met before any payment under the STI scheme can be made – minimum performance threshold, on-target
and maximum performance. 100% of the amount allocated to that target area is payable when the on-target level
is achieved. Performance against both financial and non-financial measures is assessed and approved by the Board
each year.
If the hurdle or gate opener for underlying EBITDA performance against budget is not achieved, no STI payment will
be made. The gate opener for the financial KPI is based on achieving 90% of underlying EBITDA performance target
and for the three remaining KPIs (each of which is only payable if the target score is also achieved) the gate opener is
80% of EBITDA.
Provided the gate opener is met for each KPI, minimum performance achievement across all KPIs would return an STI
payment of 84.75% of the available target opportunity.

A 100% pay-out is based on achieving 100% of the financial targets and meeting all the other KPI target criteria. The
maximum performance levels allow employees to be rewarded for performance that exceed on-target levels, up to a
specified maximum.
The maximum amount of payment for an Executive Leadership Team member under the company component of the
STI scheme is 155% of the on-target amount and is based on significant overachievement being 125% or more of the
financial targets and meeting all the other KPI target criteria.
The balance of the STI for the Executive team not weighted to business performance is related to the achievement
of individual performance measures, which is also assessed by the Board. For the CEO in FY24, the weighting of
individual achievement was 20% of the available STI opportunity and for the remaining Executive team members this
weighting was 30%. The maximum payable under the individual portion of the STI scheme was 100% for stretch
individual performance.
Long-term incentives
The Chief Executive, Executive Team and a small number of senior leaders have the opportunity to participate in an
LTI plan, which is typically offered annually at the discretion of the Board. The purpose of this plan is to align senior
management with shareholders’ interests and optimise long-term shareholder returns.
For the FY25 LTI plan, the opportunity is 50% of fixed annual remuneration for the Chief Executive, 20-40% of fixed
annual remuneration for the Executive Team and 15–25% of salary for eligible senior leaders. Vesting of the LTI plan is
contingent on meeting absolute and relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance hurdles at the conclusion of
a three-year period. In addition, the participant needs to be employed by Summerset during the vesting period.
Under the plan, participants are granted zero-priced share options. Each zero-priced option entitles the holder to one
ordinary share in the company on vesting.

LTI performance plans
As at 31 December 2024, there are three LTI plans that are yet to vest. These plans have performance periods which
end as follows:
Name of LTI plan

Vesting date – Tranche 1

Vesting date – Tranche 2

FY22 LTI plan

31 December 2024

31 December 2025

FY23 LTI plan

31 December 2025

31 December 2026

FY24 LTI plan

31 December 2026

31 December 2027

These plans have slightly different performance hurdles and comparator groups, as Summerset has taken a number
of steps over several years to modify the plans to more closely align with market practice.

FY21 transitional grant
In FY21 a transitional LTI grant was awarded to participants. This was a time-based grant, with no performance hurdles
attached and was awarded to offset the change in LTI vesting cycles that occurred in 2021 (from two and three years,
to three and four years).
FY22 LTI plan performance hurdles
The FY22 plan that vested in December 2024 has 50% of the zero-priced options not subject to performance
conditions, with the remaining 50% being subject to performance conditions. Of the options subject to performance
conditions, 70% are based on financial performance (absolute earnings and relative earnings) and the remaining 30%
are based on conditions relating to clinical, staff and customer satisfaction.
50%

Absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget)

20%

Relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group)

10%

Clinical strategy delivery

10%

People (5% staff engagement, 5% staff turnover)

10%

Customer satisfaction (5% village residents, 5% care centre residents)

117

Annual Report 2024

When all performance hurdles for a tranche meet minimum performance requirements, and including that tranche's
tenure-based options, a total of 55.6% of that tranche's options vest.
On-target performance of all performance hurdles for a tranche, including that tranche's tenure-based portion, results
in a total of 74.1% of that tranche's options vesting. 100% of the options for each tranche vest when the absolute and
relative earnings (financial performance) hurdles achieve or exceed 125% of the on-target performance requirement,
and all other performance hurdles meet their on-target performance criteria. This includes the tranche's tenurebased options.

FY23 and FY24 LTI plan performance hurdles
The FY23 and FY24 LTI plans were further adjusted to remove non-financial performance hurdles. The FY23 and FY24
LTI plans have the same performance hurdles however, the peer group against which relative TSR performance was
measured for the FY24 plan was broadened to ensure continued appropriateness and reduce potential volatility:
•

Absolute Shareholder Return (aTSR) – 75%

•

Relative Shareholder Return (rTSR) – 25%

The number of aTSR share options that vest is determined by the TSR generated against Summerset’s cost of equity
(plus a margin). The maximum that can be earned under this component is 100% of the target option grant.
The number of rTSR share options that vest is determined by the company’s TSR over the performance period relative
to the peer group which includes the NZX 50, excluding banking institutions. If Summerset’s TSR performance is below
100% of the weighted average for the peer group, then no share options will vest. If Summerset’s TSR performance
is above 125% of the weighted average for the peer group then 100% of the share options will vest. Payouts are a
straight-line interpolation between 0 and 100% for both aTSR and rTSR.
Share options will lapse if the vesting conditions are not satisfied. Share options also lapse if the holder
ceases to be employed by Summerset during the vesting period, unless otherwise determined by the Board for
exceptional circumstances.

The CEO’s fixed remuneration comprising annual salary and taxable benefits was $850,000 per annum, with effect
from 26 February 2024. The STI and LTI (based on the value granted in the FY24), is 45% and 50% respectively of fixed
remuneration. STI had maximum available payment of 155% of the on-target as noted above. The LTI grant for 2024 will
vest based on performance to 31 December 2027 (tranche 1) and 31 December 2028 (tranche 2), subject to retention
and performance criteria being met. Further details are included in the LTI Plan entitlements section.

ESG disclosures
CEO/worker ratio
The pay gap represents the number of times greater the CEO remuneration is to the remuneration of an employee
paid at the median of all Summerset employees. For the purposes of determining the median paid to all Summerset
employees, all permanent full-time, permanent part-time and fixed-term employees are included, with part-time
employees, remuneration adjusted to a full-time equivalent amount.
At 31 December 2024, the CEO’s salary of $819,534 was 13.2 times (2023: 10.97 times) that of the median employee
salary at $62,296 per annum. The CEO's total remuneration, including STIs and LTIs, of $1,524,952, was 23.0 times
(2023: 20.24 times) the total remuneration of the median employee at $66,282 per annum.
Gender pay gap
Summerset is committed to cultivating a workplace that embraces diversity and inclusivity and acknowledges the
significance of addressing gender pay equity within the unique context of New Zealand and Australia. We continue to
examine the factors contributing to our gender pay gap, which is 17% as at 31 December 2024. The gender pay gap is
11.8% for our senior leadership cohort1which is split 55% male and 45% female. The gender pay gap is largely driven by
a wider gap in our Development & Construction business areas (23.7%) due to a relative lack of female representation
within these areas. Our gender pay gap for staff who work in our village and care centre operations is 4.4%.
1

We have defined our senior leadership as those employees placed within the top three pay bands in our organisation

We have planned a number of actions to address our overall gender pay gap that span three key areas: 1) creating
inclusive environments, 2) increasing diversity in our hiring pipelines without compromising talent quality, and 3)
reducing potential for bias in our pay decisions.
We aim to foster an environment that values all employees, and we recognise the importance of fair compensation
and equal opportunities for everyone on our team. Summerset affirms its commitment to advancing discussions and
initiatives that contribute to a workplace where every individual is accorded respect and opportunities.
Remuneration bands
The number of employees or former employees (including employees holding office as Directors of subsidiaries),
who received remuneration and other benefits valued at or exceeding $100,000 during the financial year
ended 31 December 2024 is specified in the following table.
The remuneration figures shown in the Remuneration column include all monetary payments actually paid
during FY24. The table also includes the value of options granted to individual employees under Summerset’s
LTI plan during the same period. The table does not include amounts paid after 31 December 2024 that relate to the
year ended 31 December 2024. The method of calculating remuneration is consistent with the method applied for the
previous year.

Director remuneration
The Board of Directors fees were increased by shareholder resolution with effect from 1 May 2024. The resolution
increased the pool of funds approved by shareholders for payment of Directors' fees.

121

Annual Report 2024

As at 31 December 2024, the maximum aggregate amount of remuneration payable by Summerset to Directors (in
their capacity as Directors) was $1,010,000 per annum for the non-executive Directors (prior to 1 May 2024: $904,450)
and annualised standard Directors’ fees were $960,000, inclusive of additional remuneration for committee Chairs
and comittee members (prior to 1 May 2024: $845,000 noting this figure does not include any Committeee member
fee, new from 1 May 2024)). In respect of Australian based Directors, the Board has decided to pay those Directors in
Australian Dollars at the same face value the New Zealand Directors are paid. This results in those Directors receiving
slightly higher fees (as recorded in the table below). As at 31 December 2024, the only Director who received payment
in Australian dollars was Stephen Bull.
As at 31 December 2024, the standard Director fees per annum are as follows:

The Committee member fee is payable to Directors (other than the Chair) who are a member of a standing Committee.
The fee is payable once per Director (i.e. if a Director is a member of two Committees, they will receive a single fee
of $10,000).
In addition to standard Directors’ fees, in 2024 $10,000 was also paid for additional responsibilities above and beyond
the normal duties of the Board or any standard Committee. These fees related to due diligence work for the issue of
retail bonds in March 2024.
Directors’ fees exclude GST, where appropriate. Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for costs directly
associated with carrying out their duties, including travel costs.
Directors and Officers also have the benefit of Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. Cover is for damages,
judgements, fines, penalties, legal costs awarded and defence costs arising from wrongful acts committed
while acting for Summerset. There are some exclusions within the policy. The insurance cover is supplemented
by the provision of Director and Officer indemnities from the Company, but this does not extend to criminal acts.
The Company distinguishes the structure of non-executive Directors’ remuneration from that of executive Directors.
The total amount of remuneration and other benefits received by each Director during the year ended 31 December
2024 is provided below. These amounts reflect actual payments to directors during the year, and consequently,
depending on each Director's quarterly billing cycle, payroll periods and the actual payment date, the amounts
stated may vary between directors and may not be representative of the directors' fees earned for the year ended
31 December 2024.
