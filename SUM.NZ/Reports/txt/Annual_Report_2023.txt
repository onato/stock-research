Chair and CEO’s
report
Welcome to our annual report for
the 12 months ended 31 December
2023. Despite significant challenges,
Summerset has had a year of
considerable achievements.

Mark Verbiest
Chair
04

We have been able to continue to
deliver value for our residents and
shareholders during a year which has
been one of the most challenging
we’ve seen as a company. Increasing
inflation, recruitment shortages and
a falling residential property market
made business difficult throughout
the year, and yet we continued
to grow.
Over 2023 we saw a record 1,103
sales of Occupation Rights, our
highest year to date, and an
excellent result in a very difficult
macroeconomic environment.

Scott Scoullar
Chief Executive Officer

The downturn in the New Zealand
property market presented a new
challenge for our Sales team in 2023.
With housing turnover reportedly
at its lowest in decades we had
to adapt to help our prospective
residents who wanted to join our
village communities.
To make it easier for our future
residents to join their chosen village,
we employed a number of sales
mechanisms to assist them move
into our villages while they were
still selling their home. Providing
flexibility helped new residents to
sell their homes and get organised
at a time when selling homes was
taking longer.
However, while the residential
property market certainly has an
influence on our business, our strong
sales and demand pipeline shows

that we are not solely dependent
upon the property market to grow.
This is because our residents are
often motivated by life events when
moving to Summerset. They come to
us for a change in lifestyle, security,
health, desire for community and
more. We continued to see these
motivating factors prompting shifts
into our villages while the residential
property market was in a state of flux.
Throughout the year demand
for our retirement living offering
significantly increased, with our
waitlists and prospective resident
databases increasing considerably.
The underlying factors driving
demand in the market look set
to continue. To meet this demand
we have continued to strengthen
our development pipeline in both
New Zealand and Australia. This
year we announced the purchase
of two pieces of land – Rolleston
and Mosgiel in New Zealand. We
continue to explore opportunities
in both countries to expand our
portfolio and land bank.
This year was a landmark for
our Australian business with
the first homes delivered at
our Cranbourne North village
in December. Summerset’s first
Australian residents will move into
their new village in March 2024.
Our hard work has been recognised
with Summerset receiving a number
of awards this year, including
winning Gold for the Reader's Digest
2024 Quality Service Award in
the Retirement Villages category,
it is an honour that New

CHAIR AND CEO’S REPORT

Zealand consumers named us for
this accolade.
Business performance
Underlying profit for 2023 is
$190.3 million, an increase of 11.0%
on 2022. Our IFRS net profit after
tax is $436.3 million, up 62.2%
on 2022. Operating cash flows
of $398.2 million have increased
8.0% from last year. The value of
our investment property is now
$6.4 billion, up 18.3% on 2022,
largely as a result of new purchases
and development.
We are very pleased with the
overall performance of the business
for 2023. We have been able to
withstand significant challenges to
deliver an increase in our underlying
and net (IFRS) profits.
We have continued to show how
we can run our business efficiently
and effectively in unpredictable and
difficult conditions, and at the same
time position ourselves for growth
into the future.
Levels of uncontracted stock have
increased on FY22 but this is
unsurprising as we opened two
new main buildings at our Bell
Block (New Plymouth) and Te Awa
(Napier) villages. Both villages have
had very high demand for their
apartments, and care and memory
care facilities but historically we
know main buildings take 18–24
months to sell down. When we
exclude the new main buildings our
uncontracted stock is down 19%
year-on-year, a very pleasing result
in a tough market.
The Board is pleased to declare
a final dividend of 13.2 cents per
share, payable on 22 March 2024.
Combined with our interim dividend
of 11.3 cents per share, shareholders
have received 24.5 cents per share
for the 2023 financial year — a 9.9%
increase over 2022.
Our dividend policy has been to pay
out 30-50% of underlying profit for
the full year period and we have

traditionally paid at the lower end of
this range to balance the desire to
invest for growth with the preference
of some shareholders for yield.
Summerset's growth strategy is to
deliver on expansion opportunities
in New Zealand and Australia that
will produce competitive returns for
our shareholders.
We are expecting strong underlying
profit growth over the medium
term as our business matures,
which is why we signalled at
our half-year results announcement
that we were undertaking a
review of our Dividend Policy to
ensure it remained appropriate for
Summerset moving forward.
As part of our review we
benchmarked our current policy
against NZX and ASX companies,
tested alternatives and obtained
feedback from our retail and
institutional investors, as well as
investment analysts in our sector.
Our analysis found that our dividend
policy had broad acceptance with
our shareholders and was consistent
with our peers. Many of our
stakeholders highlighted that it
was important to them that the
dividend policy is free from technical
adjustments, can be forecast by the
investment community and is easily
understood by retail investors.
With this information in mind,
the Board has decided to leave
the dividend measure unchanged.
However, the policy range of paying
30–50% of underlying profit was
slightly narrower than it needed to
be, so in order to be more flexible
and prudent in our approach we
have opted to move to 20–50% of
underlying profit.
This gives us more scope to reinvest
our profits when we need to, in
order to maintain long-term financial
health, while ensuring we continue
to give our investors an appropriate
return on their investment where
we can.

Care
Our continuum of care model
remains a key part of our appeal
to prospective residents. We are
committed to providing high-quality
care, and we continue to invest
to provide our residents with the
peace of mind that should their
needs change they have options
at Summerset.
During 2023 we opened new main
buildings at our Kenepuru, Bell Block
and Te Awa villages, which all feature
our world-class care and memory
care centres.
In the care centres, we are
commencing a move to a household
model approach, creating smaller,
family grouping sized environments
which help to grow relationships and
create a sense of home.
In addition to opening new facilities,
we have continued the work to
refurbish our older, first-generation,
facilities around the country. Our
Levin, Havelock North and Trentham
(Upper Hutt) villages’ care centres
are all in varying stages of
development. At each village we will
create a modern facility that better
caters to the needs and demands of
our current and future residents.
We’re also investing in new
technology, including ceiling hoists
above beds being rolled out at all
care centres over the next two years.
These are easier to operate and safer
for both our residents and staff.
Regulation and funding
Throughout the year we’ve
continued, along with many of
our competitors, to advocate for
adequate funding for the aged care
sector. Successive governments
have failed to invest adequately
in aged care and the sector has
become unsustainable.
Aged care beds are closing around
the country, and without change a
large proportion of New Zealand’s
growing aged population will need
to be cared for in hospitals, which

05

Annual Report 2023

has a flow-on effect to the entire
health sector.

Act. We welcome any changes that
make operators raise their standards.

The New Zealand Aged Care
Association (NZACA), with support
from Summerset and other aged
care providers, ran a compelling
campaign highlighting this risk,
called the Domino Effect. More
elderly New Zealanders in hospital
beds or requiring home care
will impact the health system
dramatically, affecting people of all
ages who need hospital care.

Most of Summerset’s practices
already align with the proposals in
the review, for instance we stop
weekly fees after someone vacates
their home, there are no charges
for maintenance and repairs and we
have worked hard to create plain
English documentation.

As a large company Summerset
can, and will, continue to keep
providing care. While we continue to
be committed to providing the very
best care possible for our residents
and we are investing in care, we are
rationalising our care offering. Our
future care centres will be smaller
and will be targeted primarily at
providing a continuum of care to our
independent residents.
As well as funding, finding nursing
staff continues to be an issue for the
sector. It's estimated that there are
more than 1,200 nursing vacancies
in the sector (nearly 25% of nurses
required). While aged care nurses’
salaries were increased 11% this year
to achieve parity with public sector
nurses, Te Whatu Ora increased pay
for hospital nurses shortly after this,
which meant rather than pay parity
the gap remains at least $4,000 per
annum depending on their level.
This has again made aged care
nursing a less attractive option for
nurses when they earn less than
nurses with the same qualifications
and experience in public hospitals.
We continue to advocate with
health officials for a more
equitable outcome.
Summerset also welcomed the
review by the Ministry of Housing
and Urban Development (MHUD) of
the Retirement Villages Act. MHUD
released a discussion document to
the public asking for views about a
number of proposals to change the

Resident initiatives and events
Our purpose is “bringing the
best of life” and we continually
look for opportunities to innovate
and improve on the experience
we provide our residents in all
our villages.
In 2023 we have run a successful
pilot of our Holiday Homes
programme which gives residents
and their families the opportunity
to rent a fully furnished apartment
in one of our villages. The pilot at
three villages was very successful
and popular and we plan to roll it out
to more villages in 2024.
Our entertainment series
“Summerset Sessions” continues
to deliver a mixture of content
live and on-demand to residents
regardless of where they are in
the country. These sessions include
“Cooking with a MasterChef”, our
musical series “Summerset Sings”,
and “An Interview With...” featuring
well-known personalities and
hosted by Summerset Ambassador
Jude Dobson.
Popular singer Will Martin performed
for Summerset residents in
Wellington, Christchurch and
Hawke’s Bay during the year, and
we held resident competitions
including Summerset’s Best Garden
and the Summerset Challenge. The
challenge tested residents' quiz
skills, with regional finalists travelling
to Wellington to compete to be the
best quiz team in our villages.
Our efforts have been recognised
by residents, with our satisfaction
scores remaining extremely high –

96% of village residents and 95%
of care residents tell us they are
very satisfied or satisfied with their
experience with us.
We were also named the Best
Provider Nationwide in Aged
Advisor’s annual "Peoples’ Choice
Awards". As well as the nationwide
win, five of our villages were named
finalists in their categories. The most
satisfying aspect of this award is that
it’s voted on by consumers, including
retirement village residents and their
families. We were honoured that
many of our residents nominated us.
Design and technology
We have continued to modify the
designs and features of our villages
to meet the needs of our current
and future residents, and to tailor
designs for their varying locations
around the country.
Our first provincial main building
(PMB), the village centre that
provides resident amenities and
care facilities, will be built at our
Blenheim village. Built to our usual
high specification, it will be single
storey to be in keeping with its
location and be constructed faster
for our residents.
Similarly, we have been designing
our refreshed regional main building
(RMB). Our current RMBs have been
built successfully and to the delight
of residents around the country for a
number of years, but the needs and
demands of our residents has meant
it’s time to refresh the design.
We continue to look at how the
quality and greenspace in our
villages can be maximised too,
with children’s playgrounds, wider
streets, small parks and indoor/
outdoor golf ranges all being
investigated in our designs.
We also continue to invest in
technology to enhance the lives and
experiences of our residents around
the country. Our resident experience
services and experiences platform
Lumin is now rolled out to seven

villages and will go to a further eight
by 2025. Lumin allows residents to
communicate with each other, book
activities, access entertainment and
much more, all on a specially
designed tablet with a system
designed for elderly users.
Summerset is one of the few village
operators in the country to offer
anything like this to its residents
and we believe it’s a huge step
forward in how we communicate
with, and enable, our residents to get
on and enjoy their retirement with
technology that makes their lives in
the village easier.
New Zealand construction
and development
Our design and consenting
programme continues to position us
well for growth across New Zealand.
In New Zealand we have a very well
diversified portfolio with 73% of our
land bank having resource consent.
Those consents allow flexibility in the
rate and location of development, so
we can respond to localised demand
and supply, and the changing
economic conditions.

This past year has been an excellent
example of the flexibility we can
bring to our build programme.
We back-weighted deliveries to the
second half of the year where we saw
economic and market conditions
improving, to better enable the sale
and settlement of our homes.
We also opted to prudently deliver
a total number of units at the
lower end of our market guidance
while market conditions were less
favourable. This year we delivered
633 homes under Occupation Right
Agreement and 49 care beds in
New Zealand. This reflects growth of
around 5% in construction numbers,
another record year for Summerset.
Our construction team worked
across 17 New Zealand sites this
year, including delivering two new
main buildings complete with indoor
pools, memory and care centres,
cafes and other facilities, and
completing our Kenepuru (Porirua)
and Hobsonville (Auckland) villages.
We also handed over the first
homes at our Cambridge, Boulcott
(Lower Hutt), Waikanae, Milldale
(Auckland) and Blenheim villages,

and commenced construction at a
number of sites including Rangiora.
We expect to increase our output
of homes next year with the
market picking up. Our sophisticated
delivery programme means that we
can scale up and we expect to
build 675–725 homes next year. This
includes delivering our St Johns
(Auckland) village, where 60% of
the 329 homes, as well as the main
building and the care centre, will be
completed in the first stage.
We began the process of divesting
our Parnell site this year, as part
of actively managing our portfolio
weighting of capital deployed
across intensive metropolitan
developments and the regional
developments (which recycle cash
faster). The economics of this
village were very strong over
the long term, and it was
consented, but it fell outside our
current strategy of minimising
the number of concurrent capitalintense metropolitan projects
under development.
In 2022 we advised shareholders
of the tragic death of Michael

07

Annual Report 2023

Noche, a scaffolding contractor who
worked for Marin Construction on
our St Johns site. We worked with
WorkSafe NZ during 2023 while they
investigated Michael’s death.
WorkSafe advised late in 2023 that
they were not taking any action
against either Marin or Summerset.
While we were reassured that
Worksafe didn't feel any action was
warranted, we have not lost sight of
the fact that this was, of course, a
terrible tragedy for Michael’s family,
colleagues and for us as a business
and we needed to learn from it.
As a company we have made
modifications to our processes and
worked across the construction
industry to lead change that we
hope will make our people as safe
as possible when using temporary
work structures.
08

Costs and procurement
We have worked hard to keep a tight
lid on our costs to ensure we set
ourselves up for long-term growth.
Construction costs have been a
focus for us this year as inflation and
materials shortages saw prices rise
sharply, but we are seeing the market
stabilise now.
Our Procurement team works hard
to secure value-for-money longterm contracts through the strong
relationships we have with our
suppliers and we’re confident we’re
tightly managing our construction
costs. This work and the diligence of
our Construction team has meant
that we’ve delivered our forecast
homes on time and within budget.
Our hard work has seen us deliver
a very healthy development margin
through 2023 of 31.6%, well above
the 20–25% guidance we gave
last year.
Like most New Zealand businesses,
we saw overhead costs such as
rates and insurance increasing in
2023. While we can flex our weekly
fees to meet these costs, we opted
to keep our weekly fee increase

as low as possible this year in
recognition that inflation was having
a big impact on our residents too. We
are committed to not increasing fees
beyond the percentage increase to
NZ Superannuation, and this year we
set our weekly fee increase at half
that of superannuation.
Australia
In Australia we achieved a major
milestone with the delivery of our
first homes at our Cranbourne North
village. Our first Australian residents
will move in March 2024.
Construction begins at our Chirnside
Park development shortly, and both
our Oakleigh South and Craigieburn
sites have been consented. We
continue to build a strong land
bank and we plan to mirror our
New Zealand programme where
we have a high percentage of our
sites consented so we can flex our
build programme as demand and
supply dictate. Our three other sites
at Torquay, Mernda and Drysdale
are all progressing through their
consent processes.
Australia continues to offer huge
growth opportunities for us if we
can access the right sites, and we
are now also looking at sites beyond
Melbourne and Victoria. We see
Queensland as the next logical step
in our strategic growth into Australia.
This move will provide us with more
diversity in our portfolio and allow
us to manage market movements
with greater flexibility, similar to
our development approach in New
Zealand where we can adapt to
changing market conditions. We
plan to continue to grow our land
bank in Victoria in parallel to our
expansion into Queensland.
We’re very pleased to have reached
the major milestone of opening
our first Australian village and look
forward to delivering more homes
and villages in the coming years.

Our people
Our people are crucial to our
success. At our heart we are a
people-centred business providing
high-quality homes, care, food,
entertainment, support, therapy and
much more to more than 8,000
people in our villages across New
Zealand, and now into Australia.
Without great people we can’t do
our work and we can’t achieve our
purpose of “bringing the best of life”.
Throughout this year we have
invested in our people, providing
them with the tools and
opportunities to flourish and grow
their careers.
Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) has been
a focus for us to ensure that all our
staff are comfortable and supported
to bring all of themselves to their
workplace. All Summerset managers
were given D&I training through the
year, and we’ve supported employee
representative groups such as our
Pride Network and our Women in
Construction forum.
We’ve supported our people’s
wellbeing by providing them with
access to financial, physical and
mental health information, and we
delivered mental health awareness
training to Summerset managers so
they can support their people more.
Our people’s health and safety is,
of course, of enormous importance
to us as a business. We have
implemented a new three-year
Health and Safety (H&S) strategy and
we’ve grown our H&S compliance
team to ensure that we are doing
everything we can to protect our
people. In 2024 we will introduce
a new H&S monitoring system that
will be a better fit for our varying
business units and allow us to
capture and analyse more of our
data to make improvements quickly
across our villages, constructions
sites and offices.
In recognising that the cost of living
was impacting our people across

CHAIR AND CEO’S REPORT

Summerset's "Green Team" wins a Construction Sector Accord Beacon Award

the country we gifted a one-off
payment of $250 to 65% of our
staff. They were identified through
our set criteria as needing it the
most and in order to give them a
meaningful amount.
We are also pleased to report that
659 permanent staff received free
Summerset shares this year as part
of the vesting of our annual staff
share scheme, and 1,944 eligible
staff received $1,000 of Summerset
shares which vest in July 2026.
Sustainability
Sustainability continues to be a big
focus for the business and we’ve
made huge strides since we started
measuring and reporting on our
environmental impacts. We know
there is a long way to go but we
believe we are on the right track to
meet our sustainability targets.
We were pleased to publish our
Sustainability Review in May which
detailed the many changes we have
made over the last five years.
Our Sustainability Review was our
first step into ESG (environmental,
social and governance) reporting

and cataloguing what we do across
these areas. We have evolved our
new version of this document and
included mandatory climate related
disclosures, which were legislated by
the government in 2023. Our new
Sustainability Review document and
disclosures can be found on the
Summerset website.
All parts of our business have
sustainability goals at the core,
whether it is designing and building
new villages, managing the use of
fossil fuels in our existing facilities,
or removing unnecessary plastic
packaging from our supply chain.
At the same time, we are committed
to creating vibrant, connected
communities with skilled, caring, and
dedicated staff right across New
Zealand and Australia.
Waste reduction in our construction
business continues to be a major
focus for our business and all 17
construction sites we worked on
this year worked hard to reduce
waste wherever possible, resulting
in 4,372 tonnes of waste diverted
from landfill. A great deal of work
has also been done reviewing the

entire building life cycle from design,
procurement, pre-construction
through to waste treatment.
Our work was recognised with
our construction waste avoidance
initiative, titled “Building out Waste
by Thinking Green” winning a
Construction Sector Accord Beacon
Award. Our Think Green programme
was also recognised in the
Retirement Village Association’s
Sustainability Awards where we
won the APL Operator-led
Sustainability Award for our work
in reducing our carbon emissions
and embedding sustainability across
the organisation.
Outside of awards, we were pleased
to again be recognised by Forsyth
Barr in their second Carbon and ESG
Ratings for NZX listed companies.
We were again 11th of all NZX-listed
companies based on their criteria
and we're still the top-rated listed
retirement village operator.
We have continued to roll out green
initiatives at our villages too with our
Karaka village having photovoltaic
solar panels installed this year, and

09

Annual Report 2023

the pool at our Manukau village is
now heated by solar panels too.
Further information is available
in our Sustainability Review and
Climate-related Disclosures FY23
report on the Summerset website
at www.summerset.co.nz/investorcentre/esg-reporting/.
Emergency preparedness
and response
The catastrophic flooding in the
Auckland and Northland regions,
and Cyclone Gabrielle’s impact
across large parts of the North Island,
tested our resilience with multiple
villages suffering power outages
during these events.

10

Our Napier and Te Awa villages
were the most heavily impacted,
with power out for significant
periods, and Te Awa residents
having to temporarily evacuate as a
precaution during the flooding. We
were very pleased that all our village
residents and staff were physically
unharmed during this time and that
none of our villages sustained any
major damage.
The benefits of our scale and expert
staff based around the country
were evident during the cyclone.
Summerset was able to provide
extra generators to power our main
buildings, set up Wi-Fi hotspots for
residents to keep in touch with loved
ones, fly in staff to support their
colleagues and residents and cook
meals for residents for two weeks
while they got back onto their feet.
For our staff we created a disaster
relief fund so they could get
access to cash quickly to replace
anything in their homes that had
been damaged, pay bonds if they
needed to move to new rental
accommodation and anything else
that they might need to look after
themselves and their families. We’d
like to take the time here to thank
the staff of our villages who were
impacted by the flooding and
Cyclone Gabrielle. Their dedication

and support made our residents’
lives a lot easier under very
trying circumstances.
We completed a comprehensive
review of our actions and
preparedness following Cyclone
Gabrielle and have made
changes including purchasing
more generators, installing Starlink
wireless broadband, and updating
our Emergency Response and
Business Continuity plans based on
lessons learned from the event.
Board and Executive changes
We farewelled long serving Board
member, Anne Urlwin, in February
2023 and welcomed our newest
director, Fiona Oliver, who was
formally elected at our April AGM.
Fiona brings significant commercial,
investment and governance
expertise to the Summerset Board
from her experience at Freightways,
First Gas/First Gas Services,
Gentrack and others. Fiona has taken
Anne’s role as chair of our Audit &
Risk Committee.
Chris Lokum joined Summerset as
GM of People & Culture in October.
Chris replaced Dave Clegg who,
after a successful four years with
us, decided to move into a wellearned retirement. Chris joined us
from Waka Kotahi and before that
spent many years in HR in Australia
and the UK, including her role as Vice
President of HR-Fuels in Asia Pacific
at BP.
Chris is known for delivering
organisation efficiency, increasing
organisational capability and
providing strategic leadership. She
is passionate about people and
culture, and brings a strategic,
commercial and business lens to
her work.
Looking forward
While the economic outlook remains
uncertain, we are optimistic for
the coming year. We have come
through one of the most challenging

in Summerset’s history with robust
demand and record sales numbers.
Not only this but we’ve also met
our targeted build rate, opened our
first Australian village, added to our
significant land bank, and continued
to invest in our residents' experience.
During 2023 we showed our ability
to navigate the business through
challenging times while continung
to grow. We have managed our
costs very closely through the year
and brought our gearing down
from our half-year result. We have
acted prudently where we’ve had to,
reducing our build rate to align with
market conditions, and made tough
decisions like planning to sell our
Parnell land.
Subject to economic conditions we
look forward to continued growth in
the year ahead.
Finally, on behalf of the Summerset
Board and management, we’d like
to thank our investors, residents and
partners for your commitment to,
and belief in, Summerset’s goals and
future. We’d also like to thank our
Summerset team, their families and
their support networks for another
very successful year.

For investors, we are primarily a growth
stock, with a clear strategy to continue
expanding in New Zealand
and Australia.

BUILD HIGH-QUALITY ASSETS
We pride ourselves on building
and maintaining villages that are
well designed, well located, and
that enable our residents to interact
with the community. Our expanding
geographical presence is based on
being in growing regions with strong
potential for investment gains.

HIRE SKILLED STAFF
AND HELP THEM THRIVE
We recognise our people as
our most important asset.
They underpin our ability to deliver
the best of life to our residents.
We celebrate their diversity and are
committed to ensuring all our staff
are well remunerated, motivated
and safe.

LOOK AFTER OUR RESIDENTS
We want our residents to feel secure
and respected, and our consistently
high satisfaction rates reflect that. We
are also committed to our continuum of
care model and providing residents high
quality assistance should their needs
change as they age.

PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT
We have short-, medium- and longterm sustainability plans in place to
reduce our carbon emissions intensity
over time and to monitor our progress
and performance. We significantly

OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

Our people and
community
We’re proud to be home to more than
8,000 retirement village residents. Our vibrant
and diverse communities are built, run and
supported by over 2,800 staff.
Bringing the best of life is
Summerset’s purpose, and we value
and recognise our people who
are at the core of delivering this
to our residents. Our business
functions across Australasia are
multi-faceted – we employ a
diverse range of roles to design
beautiful villages, construct highquality homes and buildings, give
our residents amazing experiences
and care, and bring new residents to
live in our villages every week.
For more than 25 years, Summerset
has been dedicated to creating
retirement villages that go beyond
providing homes and evolve into
thriving communities. We were
delighted to win the Aged Advisor’s
2023 "Peoples' Choice Award"
for Group Provider Nationwide,
underscoring the genuine affection
our residents have for the lifestyle
we offer.
The award is based purely on
independent reviews and ratings
from residents and their families
throughout New Zealand. We were
very proud to get this endorsement
from them to win this award.
Also, an outstanding achievement
for us this year was being named

winner of the coveted Reader’s
Digest 2024 Quality Service Award in
the Retirement Villages category. To
find those companies that provide
the highest level of customer service
and that truly understand and value
consumer needs, Reader’s Digest
approaches everyday consumers
to ask them to assess companies
across five pillars of customer
service. These prestigious awards
have been running for ten years,
and while we've been runner-up a
number of times, taking top spot this
year is a testament to our team's
commitment to bring the best of life.
Emergency preparedness
In 2021 and 2022 the global
COVID-19 pandemic challenged our
teams to think and act differently in
how we continued to safely provide
the quality experiences that village
life offers. As an aged care provider,
COVID-19 was still with us in 2023
and impacted a number of our care
centres; however, our skilled teams
have managed to care for residents
while safely continuing visits. It
meant we didn’t have to close our
care centres to visitors (except under
special circumstances) like we’d had
to in previous years.

The challenges of extreme weather
events earlier in the year further
strengthened our resilience and
adaptability to focus on the needs of
our residents and staff. Particularly in
Hawke’s Bay with Cyclone Gabrielle,
we were able to lean on our
exceptional people throughout the
business who assisted with the
logistics of procuring additional
generators, food and supplies, as
well as filling in for staff who
had been personally affected by
the event.
We are very proud of the lengths
that our people went to in finding
and delivering these solutions and in
ensuring that our residents and their
families were able to keep in touch
either directly or through our regular
communication updates during a
very difficult time for the region.
Engaging residents
We pride ourselves on the
opportunities socially, physically and
mentally that we can provide our
residents to bring them the best
of life, and our annual resident
engagement scores are an indicator
of how well we’re getting those
experiences right. This year, 96%
of village residents tell us that

21

Annual Report 2023

they are very satisfied or satisfied
with their experience, which is an
improvement over 2022. For our
care residents, 95% are very satisfied
or satisfied, with many praising
the professionalism and care they
receive from our staff.
We maintain a continuous listening
approach to drive improvements
that our residents tell us are
important to them, surveying our
residents regularly on a number of
aspects of village life to understand
what is and isn’t working for them.
This allows our village managers
to understand and change things
at their village quickly to better
reflect the needs and wants of
their residents.
We’ve also committed this year
to ensure we’re keeping all our
residents and their families better
informed about what we’re doing to
bring the best of life and to bring
in innovations they’ve asked for.
This led to us launching a quarterly

email newsletter – Your Summerset –
providing regular updates.
A desire to bring loved ones closer
together was at the heart of a new
“Holiday Homes” initiative we started
trialling in February this year. The trial
involved three villages offering shortterm accommodation exclusively for
Summerset residents, families, and
friends in the village.
It offers on-site convenience
and best value for money for
residents and their families in a
fully furnished, comfortable, selfcontained apartment. During the
trial we had apartments available
at our Hobsonville, Hastings and
Richmond (Nelson) villages and it
allowed residents to travel and stay
in familiar surroundings and the
opportunity to host their family in
their village. There has been a lot of
demand and bookings so far and we
intend to roll this out further in 2024
with a view to doing this nationally
over the coming years.

Events and experiences
Our "Summerset Sessions” continue
to provide an exciting array of events
and entertainment that residents
can enjoy in person or online.
The programme includes events,
concerts, cooking lessons (with
former MasterChef winner Brett
McGregor) and interviews with wellknown Kiwis. Various Summerset
Sessions were held at villages
around the country and were filmed
at the same time so they could be
enjoyed on-demand.
We’ve also created a few new events
and initiatives this year including:
•

“A Summerset World”, a video
series filmed at each village
that highlights the vibrancy
and variety of village life and
showcases the residents who call
it home.

•

“The Great Summerset
Challenge”, a general knowledge
quiz for teams of residents.
Our first nationwide inter-village

OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

competition saw teams of
village residents from across
the country competing in six
regional events to earn a spot in
the grand final held in Wellington.
The events were live-streamed
for fellow village residents and
staff to enjoy and cheer on their
talented teams. Congratulations
to Team Heritage from our
Ellerslie village who took out the
inaugural title.
•

”Summerset’s Best Garden
Competition”, a seasonal event
to showcase how talented our
residents are at tending to their
gardens, plants and veggies,
judged by top New Zealand
landscape designer and wellknown TV and radio host
Tony Murrell.

We also continue to invest in
technology that enhances the lives
and experiences of our residents.
After a successful trial in Kenepuru of
the Lumin platform, we launched the
product at the village and installed it
at six other villages in 2023.
Lumin is run through a dedicated
17-inch tablet and allows residents to
stay connected to village life from
the comfort of their home, providing
the ability to receive newsletters,
instant messages and emergency
alerts from the village team, view and
book village activities, special events
and outings, and to connect with
fellow residents and loved ones.
We plan to roll Lumin out further in
2024 across another eight villages.
Enhancing our services and
our care
We continue to introduce and roll
out new measures and initiatives
to improve the lives of our
residents. Our care offering, and our
continuum of care model, is a very
important part of why our residents
choose us, and we want to adopt
relevant best practice to bring the
best of life to our residents.

During 2023 we opened three village
centre buildings in our Kenepuru,
Bell Block and Te Awa villages, which
in addition to a range of beautiful
village amenities also contain our
serviced apartments and state-ofthe-art care and memory care
centres. These new facilities have
allowed us to develop new initiatives
in our continuum of care offering
in those villages, including the
introduction of care apartments.
Our care apartments are certified
to provide care to residents right
up to hospital-level which means
that residents can purchase a care
apartment and can remain in their
home even if their needs change.

families when we close a care
centre in order to upgrade it, and
our team worked very closely with
them to ensure minimal disruption
in moving to alternative temporary
or permanent accommodation while
this work was undertaken. Where
possible we’ve given our residents
the opportunity to move into another
Summerset care centre if they’d like
to, and for our Trentham residents
we have temporarily leased Kelvin
House, a facility eight kilometres
down the road where they can
receive care while their homes are
refurbished. This has also allowed us
to keep our staff with us and provide
continuity of care.

It also gives couples the ability to
remain in the same home even if they
have different care needs. Our care
apartments have been very popular
and are selling very well.

We are also investing in equipment
and technology to make our care
residents more comfortable and
to maximise the effectiveness of
their care.

In the care centres, we have
commenced a move to a household
model approach, creating smaller,
family grouping sized environments
which help to grow relationships and
create a sense of home.

This year we’ve commenced
installing ceiling hoists above beds
in all our care centres to aid residents
with mobility difficulties. The ceiling
hoists are far more comfortable, and
residents tell us they feel safer than
the manual hoists. They’re also easier
to operate for our staff and reduce
the risk of strains when assisting a
resident to move.

We continue to focus on providing
high-quality aged care for our
residents already living in our care
facilities, and offering an ongoing
continuum of care with guaranteed
priority placement for our village
residents. Our care business saw
occupancy rates this year at 93% in
our developed villages.
In addition to investing in new
care facilities in new villages we
are committed to progressively
upgrading our older care centres.
Our care centre refurbishment
programme has progressed well
at our Havelock North, Trentham
and Levin villages, where extensive
refurbishment work at all three
villages is underway to modernise
these facilities and meet the needs
and expectations of our care
residents and their families.
We recognise that it is not always
easy on our residents and their

We have also completed a
successful pilot of the app version of
our resident and care management
software. The app allows staff to
enter resident care information at
the time the care is delivered, with
the benefit of saving staff valuable
time to spend with residents directly,
and also ensuring that the resident
information is shared efficiently
and effectively among care team
members. We will be rolling this out
to all our care centres in 2024.
Older people continue to enter aged
care services with complex health
and support needs and deserve
excellence in clinical care from
appropriately skilled staff.
Alongside continuing our work with
medication optimisation we have

23

Annual Report 2023

focussed on falls prevention and
management. For older people it
is important to balance the risk
of harm alongside enabling their
independence and participation in
activities. Best practice informs us of
the need to reduce loss of muscle
for older people and maximise
bone health. We have focussed on
boosting prescription of vitamin D
for residents, and boosting protein
and calcium in food offerings. These
initiatives are delivering positive
results for residents in relation to
harm from falls and unintended
weight loss.

the last 12 months and does not
address the systemic pressures the
sector is under.

Sector funding
Summerset, and many other aged
care sector operators, continue to be
very concerned about underfunding
in the wider aged care sector. The
population of New Zealanders over
85 is set to triple over the next
25 years, and estimates indicate
that at least another 40,000 aged
residential care beds, including
those providing hospital-level care,
will be needed.

We continue to support the New
Zealand Aged Care Association
(NZACA) in their work to highlight the
underfunding of aged care. This year
NZACA ran a compelling campaign
highlighting this risk, called the
Domino Effect. Without aged care
beds, more elderly New Zealanders
will end up in hospital beds which will
impact all New Zealanders who need
hospital care.

Instead of the necessary growth,
underfunding contributed to 1,000
aged care beds being permanently
closed across New Zealand in the
past year, and with nowhere else to
go our elderly will fall back on the
public health system.
Successive governments have failed
to invest in aged care, and the
sector has become unsustainable.
The former government made some
changes in the year: increasing
the funding to aged care facilities
with a lift in remuneration for aged
care nurses to reduce the pay gap
compared to public hospital nurses,
and a five percent cost pressures
increase which was added to the
funding for nurses.
These increases were collectively
expected to be 11%, and while
that was a meaningful change, it
only largely covers the inflationary
pressures operators have faced over

Also, while the nursing pay disparity
was reduced, it was only a temporary
change as Te Whatu Ora also
increased pay for public sector
nurses last year. Nurses in the
public sector continue to be paid
significantly more than aged care
nurses and this only increases
the challenges for the sector to
attract people. It’s estimated that
there are more than 1,200 nursing
vacancies in the sector (nearly 25%
of nurses required).

Not only that, the cost of providing
a hospital bed is $1,700 a day,
four-and-a-half times the break-even
cost of providing an aged care bed
at $372. At the moment providers
receive approximately $170 per day
for an aged care bed, far below
what they need and it means small
providers are closing their doors.
Our message is clear - the current
situation is not sustainable, nor
is it fair to New Zealanders
and we’ll continue to advocate
with health officials for a more
equitable outcome.
Regulatory environment
We welcomed the review of the
Retirement Villages Act 2003 led by
the Ministry of Housing and Urban
Development (MHUD). In August,
MHUD released a public discussion
paper seeking views on a number of
proposed changes to the Act.
As in every industry around the
country there are a range of

practices between the different
operators in the retirement village
sector and some have terms that are
fairer than others. We welcome these
reviews, especially where it requires
operators to raise the bar if they are
not already doing so.
Summerset is broadly aligned with
the proposed changes from MHUD
and we do not engage in the
vast majority of the practices the
review is seeking feedback on.
For instance we do not charge
weekly fees after our residents have
vacated their units, we don’t charge
additional fees for maintenance or
repairs and our advertising does
not guarantee services which are
subject to availability.
We have developed plain English,
clear and fair contract terms and
conditions for our residents. We work
hard to make sure people joining
our villages around the country have
easy-to-understand contracts and,
of course, all residents must get
independent legal advice before
they join one of our villages.
Lifting our profile
In New Zealand, the retirement
village sector is a highly competitive
environment, with 2023 being the
most competitive we’ve seen in
media investment across the main
players in the sector.
Despite this heightened activity
our independent research shows
that Summerset has continued to
hold the number one position
for consideration amongst our
core audience. This means that
Summerset is not only top of
mind for our audience, but also a
brand of choice when making the
decision to move into a retirement
village community.
We pride ourselves on being one of
the best performing in the sector
in converting advertising spend into
leads for our sales team. This year we
have seen 22% year-on-year growth

round series over five months and
commenced in November 2023.

Ahead of the opening of our
Cranbourne North village in
Australia, we began marketing in
the local media and via community
engagement activity to tell our local
target audience who we are, our
depth of experience and what we
have to offer. We will grow both
our brand and presence as we
open more villages and expand our
Australian footprint.

We provided our continued
support through partnerships with
organisations in key areas that are
important to our residents and
their families:

In addition to having in-village

this year, including attending
live rehearsals and meeting
the musicians.

We also like to give back to our local
communities where our villages
are and will be in the future.
Over the year we worked with
approximately 202 local community
clubs and organisations, including
bowls, golf, bridge and croquet

clubs, Age Concern, Lions, Rotary,
RSAs and more.
Engaging our people
Our people are exceptional and
valued - without them we couldn’t
deliver a quality retirement living
experience to the more than
8,000 residents who have made
Summerset their home.
We strive to ensure we create a
great place for them to work and
thrive, and we are committed to the
protection and promotion of their
health and wellbeing so they can
be at their best both at home and
at work.
Our wellbeing programme provides
an intranet hub with support
tools that sit alongside a calendar
of regular communications on
wellbeing initiatives, spanning
physical, mental and financial health.
During the year we changed our
Employee Assistance Programme
(EAP) provider as we seek to evolve
our offering to our people and
better ensure they have the support
available to them if they need it.

Recognising and celebrating
the dedication, commitment
and successes of our people
demonstrates how we, and our
residents, value them. We celebrate
their exceptional hard work at our
annual Applause Awards, which this
year had a record of more than
1,500 nominations received across
34 categories.
Held in Auckland, our Applause
Awards event, with 135 finalists in
attendance, was a great occasion
to celebrate our people. It was
also a highlight to be able to livestream the awards, meaning that
fellow staff and residents could
cheer on their finalists and celebrate
alongside them.
In addition to those awards, and
to allow our hardworking staff
the opportunity to be recognised
more regularly, we introduced the
Surprise and Delight monthly staff
recognition programme to support
staff to nominate their peers for their
exceptional day-to-day successes
and achievements.

OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

To increase engagement with our
village and frontline staff, we
completed a rollout of our digital
signage platform, Vibe, in all our
village staffrooms to better enable
us to communicate with those staff
who are often not at a computer
to get information they may need,
whether it’s a village-specific notice
or a national update.

Providing leadership
and development
pathways is important
to us in both
attracting and retaining
our people.

We also recognised that the cost
of living was impacting our people
across the country and gifted 65% of
our 2,500 staff a one-off payment
of $250 to help with larger than
expected bills or other necessities.
We targeted the payment to those
staff we identified as needing it
the most in order to give them a
meaningful amount.

Our Construction Management
Cadet programme offers a pathway
for motivated people to get handson, practical experience across a
range of construction disciplines.
After a minimum two years of
work our successful management
cadets graduate to be fully trained
site supervisors or junior quantity
surveyors. We commenced this
programme four years ago with
one cadet in Christchurch and now
have six around the country. They
are important roles for Summerset
to create a talent pathway and
to give talented and enthusiastic
construction workers opportunities
to progress their careers in a marketleading organisation.

We were pleased to see our work
to engage our people reflected in
our latest employee survey which
returned our highest engagement
score to date at 8.1.
Attracting and retaining talent
Now, some 18 months on from
the reopening of our borders since
COVID-19 restrictions, attracting
talent in a highly competitive market
continues to be challenging. This is
difficult particularly in nursing and
construction professions.
Employee benefits provide an
opportunity for us to differentiate
ourselves as an employer of choice
in a competitive environment,
and we are one of the market
leaders in terms of our benefits
package. We continue to enhance
our offering and look to improve
our engagement with staff through
benefits such as enhancing
our parental leave offering. All
permanent Summerset staff are
offered free health insurance and
can receive an annual $1,000 in
Summerset shares – two benefits
which our people value highly.

In our villages we work with
Careerforce to provide learning
modules that upskill our frontline
staff and allow them to increase
their remuneration. Careerforce
now marks all our modules so
our motivated people can learn
and grow.
Similarly, bringing our food services
offering in-house has seen this
side of our business evolve, and
we have created ways to attract
and retain hospitality staff with
career pathways.
While we know there is more to do
we are pleased to see our retention
figures increase four percent against
2022 to 77%.

Building safety into everything
we do
Creating safe work environments for
our people and ensuring that we are
leaders in health and safety is of the
greatest importance to us, and this
year we implemented a new threeyear Health and Safety strategy.
We are also rolling out a new
Health & Safety monitoring system
across the company in early 2024,
Donesafe, allowing us to get even
better at recording and analysing our
incidents, issues and near misses to
continuously improve how we keep
our people safe.
Following the tragic incident at our
St Johns site in November last
year, where scaffolding contractor
Michael Noche lost his life, Worksafe
completed their investigation and
advised us that they were not taking
any action against Summerset. This
outcome is welcome; however,
we also haven't lost sight of
the fact that this was a tragedy.
We are committed to continuous
improvement and undertook our
own investigations into where
improvements could be made.
Michael was working on what is
called a ‘temporary works’ structure,
and since the incident we have
made a number of process and
procedural improvements to make
our people as safe as possible
on these structures. Summerset is
leading an industry working group to
look at what can be done to make
these even safer for all construction
workers and we will be engaging
with leading engineers.

At Summerset we celebrate diversity
in all its forms and we are committed
to an inclusive culture where
everyone feels a sense of equity,
inclusion and belonging at work.

We believe it’s
important to support
our leaders to
effectively lead their

OUR VILLAGES

Our villages
Despite a challenging start to the year with
inflationary pressures and a volatile property
market we have seen record sales and demand
for our retirement living offering.
In 2023 our build programme
has continued to perform, and
we’ve delivered homes across
New Zealand as well as our first
Australian retirement homes. Even
in an economic downturn we saw
increased demand and interest,
because our residents are motivated
by many factors when deciding to
live in a retirement village – a desire
for more community, security, health
changes, lifestyle and much more.
Record levels of interest
We experienced record levels of
demand in our developing villages
with record sales settlements
and very strong presales. Our
development pipeline remains
strong to meet the growth of
demand for our retirement living
offering around the country.
It was a very busy year for our
sales teams with four new villages
welcoming their first residents
in 2023 – Cambridge in March,
Boulcott in August, Waikanae in
October, and Milldale in December.
All four new villages have sold
consistently well since opening,
particuarly Cambridge, achieving 30
settlements in 2023, followed by
Waikanae with 11 settlements.
With the completion of main
buildings at our Bell Block and
Te Awa villages, we were also
able to welcome residents into

serviced apartments, care centres
and memory care centres in
those villages.
Presales commenced for our
Blenheim village, with first residents
to move in early 2024. Our multistorey St Johns village in the heart of
Auckland has seen strong demand
and presales.
We also continued to generate
record levels of interest with strong
waitlists at our completed villages
throughout the country. Our resale
villages have very strong demand
with Whanganui, Dunedin and
Napier in particular seeing strong
levels of enquiry.
While demand has been high and
sales strong, we were mindful that
cost of living pressures and the
slowdown in the residential property
market had the potential to delay
settlement times and move-in dates
for some prospective residents. In
response, we were able to provide
comfort to those considering
coming into a Summerset village
with a Moving Made Easy package at
selected villages, offering six months
to sell their home (double our
standard offer), six months waiver of
weekly fees, a contribution towards
legal costs and a moving package.
To further support and encourage
people considering one of our
villages, we continue to grow

our in-house moving services to
support residents moving into our
villages. We are the only retirement
village provider offering this inhouse service. The response has
been so overwhelmingly positive
we now have moving specialists
based at key regions – Auckland,
Hamilton, Hawke's Bay, Wellington
and Christchurch, while also
servicing our New Plymouth and Bay
of Plenty villages.
To support prospective residents
to prepare for their next step
towards retirement village living, we
have delivered highly successful
downsizing and decluttering
seminars. We have also added real
estate seminars, partnering with
local agencies to provide their
expertise and insights, to assist
not only our prospective residents,
but also members of community
clubs and groups to understand
the current property market. These
events have been very well attended,
and valued.
We pride ourselves on our ability to
listen, understand and be flexible to
meet the needs of our prospective
and existing residents, allowing us to
continue to innovate our customer
service to help people make what
can be challenging choices about
their retirement years.

Strength in our
building programme
We have invested approximately
$500 million into our build
programme this year, and we remain
the largest constructor in the New
Zealand retirement village sector.
Once again, we have successfully
met our annual New Zealand build
target, delivering 633 units to be sold
under occupation right agreements.
Our ability to deliver year-on-year
ensures we are well positioned to
meet ongoing increases in sector
demand and we expect to deliver
675–725 homes in FY24.
All our villages under construction
met their year-end delivery targets.
There are a number of reasons
for this achievement, including
robust procurement, planning
and consenting processes, and
designing most of the villages inhouse. We also have long-standing
and reliable supply agreements
that have enabled us to secure
materials well in advance, and
after supply chain constraints
experienced during COVID-19, we

are pleased to see timber and
steel commodity pricing beginning
to ease.
We have a very mature procurement
programme and function, which
has seen us through difficult and
uncertain times, and our team
were announced as finalists in two
categories – Most Effective Team
of the Year, and Transformation of
the Year – in the New Zealand
Procurement Excellence Forum’s
2023 Awards.
Our construction teams were
simultaneously building on 17 sites
this year, including completing our
main buildings at Bell Block, and
Te Awa.
Our main buildings not only provide
village residents with an array of
amenities, but also contain our
world-class care and memory care
centres. During 2023 we also
handed over the first homes at
our Cambridge, Boulcott, Waikanae,
Milldale and Blenheim villages,
and completed our Kenepuru and
Hobsonville villages.

Work at our St Johns village has
gone very well and four of the
seven multi-level buildings will open
as a grand Stage 1 later in 2024,
comprising the main building, care
centre and 60% of all dwellings.
At our broadacre sites we take a
more staged approach, releasing
smaller quantities of new homes
as they’re built. St Johns has up to
300 subcontractors working onsite
at any one time and it’s a testament
to our team’s planning and capability
that we have continued to hit our
deadlines and this great village is
quickly taking shape.
The incredible views and location
of the St Johns village, as well
as the promised community and
amenities we’re creating there, have
led to extremely strong presales
activity with many of the penthouse
and premium apartments already
presold. When settled these will be
among the most valuable retirement
village homes in the country.

OUR VILLAGES

Summerset Palms village centre which opened in November 2023

Commitment to vibrancy
and innovation
Bringing the best of life to our
residents requires us to build vibrant
villages with superior amenities that
meet the expectations of our current
residents and consider the future
needs of our prospective residents.
Each village is designed with
consideration to its unique
surroundings, creating great indoor
and outdoor spaces and features
for our residents, their families and
friends to enjoy.
Residents have told us they want
more options and we're looking at
how we can incorporate additions
such as outdoor BBQ areas, winter
gardens, indoor/outdoor golf ranges
and children’s playgrounds in future
designs. This year our Te Awa
village residents enjoyed our first
installation of a pétanque piste.
We have commenced a redesign of
our regional main buildings (RMBs)
which are the heart of our villages
containing resident amenities, and
care and memory care centres.

The new buildings will be more
contemporary in architecture and
will be two storeys rather than
three in our current design, with
more flexible and scalable spaces
that can be adapted to various
uses such as private functions and
family gatherings. In supporting our
residents to enjoy social, active
and healthy lifestyles there will be
an increased emphasis on outdoor
leisure and activities.
Amenities on offer will match those
of the existing main buildings,
such as pools, libraries, cafes and
more but the buildings will be
smaller overall in keeping with our
aim to rationalise the scale of
our care offering – ensuring we
continue to meet the continuum
of care requirements of our village
residents. Larger care centres
capable of accommodating people
from outside the village are no longer
economic to operate under the
current government funding model.
For smaller areas or towns, we
have designed a single-storey main
building, and the first of these
provincial main buildings (PMBs) will

be built at our Blenheim village. Our
PMBs are designed to be modular,
allowing us to add or reduce different
elements as needed, or as the area
demands. For instance, we may not
include memory care in all locations
initially, but the PMB design means
we can add that in the future should
we want to.
Also boasting contemporary
architectural design and a highspecification build, the PMB will have
the added benefit of being delivered
faster to residents. PMBs will also be
more in keeping with the areas they
are located in where large two-storey
buildings are less common in the
local environment.
The largest land bank in the sector
We continue to find quality sites
to grow our business where
we’ll be able to introduce more
New Zealanders to our retirement
village lifestyle.
In New Zealand we were pleased to
announce two new land acquisitions
at Mosgiel (Dunedin) and Rolleston
(Christchurch). Both sites are well
appointed with excellent local

35

Annual Report 2023

amenities available to residents,
and make strong additions to our
land bank.
The site in Mosgiel will complement
our existing Dunedin village and
offer access to a high level of
amenities and recreational and open
space areas.
Rolleston is predicted by Statistics
New Zealand to have the highest
population growth in New Zealand
over the next 30 years. Rolleston’s
attractiveness is driven by its easy
access to Christchurch, and position
as the primary satellite town for the
Selwyn District. The site is our sixth in
the Canterbury region.

36

The new sites will each offer over
300 units and further boost our land
bank of units, the largest in New
Zealand’s retirement village sector.
We have enough secured land to
more than double the size of our
current New Zealand business.
First deliveries from these sites are
expected from FY26 onwards.
Earlier in the year, we gained consent
for our Half Moon Bay development
in east Auckland and construction
will commence in 2024. We have
also gained resource consent for
our Kelvin Grove (Palmerston North)
village, resource consent for a
premium extension to the St Johns
village, and we received the Minister
for the Environment's referral to
use the fast-track consenting
process for our Rotorua village.
A resource consent application is
currently being processed for the
Masterton village.
We also completed a strategic
review of our land portfolio and
decided to sell our Parnell site.
Despite being consented and
promising very good long-term
returns, we elected to balance the
portfolio and prudently manage
our capital demands with a higher
weight of more regional villages with
short cash recycling profiles.

We are proud to be providing
high quality homes at reasonable
prices for retirees, and we have
the capacity, the consents, and the
development capability to continue
to do so.
Australia expansion progresses
We achieved a major milestone in
our Australian build programme this
year completing the first stage of
villas at our Cranbourne North village
and look forward to welcoming
our first Australian residents to
the Summerset community in
early 2024.
Cranbourne North was our first site
to be consented and commence
construction in Australia. The
second stage of the development
is progressing well, and work will
commence on the village’s main
building in 2024. With the delivery
of these first units our team has also
expanded as we appointed our first
Village Manager and Sales Manager
in Australia.
Once complete, the village will
provide a variety of purpose-built
homes including two- and threebedroom independent living villas
and townhouses, as well as serviced
apartments for residents requiring
extra support. There will also be
extensive recreational amenities and
aged care onsite, offering options
for residents in our aged care or
memory care facility.
Enablement works are underway
and construction will begin shortly
at our Chirnside Park site. In
November we held a traditional
Smoking Ceremony at the site,
performed by local Wurundjeri
elders (the traditional owners of
the land), a significant Aboriginal
custom that cleanses places and
people of bad sprits, to promote the
wellbeing of our people and guests
in attendance.
At the end of June, we were very
pleased to receive consent for our
Oakleigh South site from Victoria’s

City of Monash Council and will
begin construction early in 2024. The
Oakleigh South site is our first inner
suburban approval for a boutique
medium-density village, and it is
important to note that the upfront
funding required to build this village
is similar to our broadacre village
model. We undertook extensive
community engagement to ensure
we developed a proposal that
met the community needs and
expectations and were pleased
of the local community support
we received.
Our Cragieburn site achieved
consent in January 2024 with the
Hume City Council approving the
Planning Permit Application.
Planning processes are continuing
well at our three other Victoria sites
at Torquay, Mernda and Drysdale,
as we build a strong land bank
and have a high percentage of
our sites consented to provide
our build programme with the
flexibility required as demand and
supply necessitates.

Australia offers huge
growth opportunities
for us and we’re
very pleased with
the progress we
have made there.
We’re looking forward
to delivering more
homes and villages
in the coming
years, and we have
begun the process
of looking beyond
Victoria as part of our
expansion strategy.

OUR VILLAGES

Staff and guests celebrating the sod turning and smoking ceremony at our second Australia site, Chirnside Park

We will seek to grow our land bank in
Victoria, but in parallel to this growth
we have started to investigate
opportunities in Queensland, as we
believe it is the next logical step in
expanding our Australian operations.
Queensland appeals as it has
supportive residential house
prices and strong forecast
population growth. The state
also has a favourable lifestyle
appeal to our target audience
and is supported by excellent
economic growth prospects and
development opportunities.
Building our land bank in
Queensland also provides us
with greater diversity in our
portfolio and ability to adjust
our Australian build programme
based on market conditions, similar
to our development approach in
New Zealand.
Australian Reconciliation
Action Plan
Summerset is founded on a deep
respect for people, striving to be
the best and bringing the best
of life. As our business develops

in Australia, we recognise the
importance of taking affirmative
action towards reconciliation efforts,
and we wanted to acknowledge the
enduring connection of Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander peoples
to the land over tens of thousands
of years.
We initiated a Reflect Reconciliation
Action Plan (Reflect RAP) as our first
step towards supporting the selfdetermination and recognition of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples, and this has now been
formally endorsed by Reconciliation
Australia. With our current and
future team, we aim to embrace
diversity, cultivate an inclusive
work environment, and enrich our
business with the knowledge to
champion reconciliation efforts.
As Summerset grows, our
villages will become home to
thousands of older Australians and
workplaces for hundreds, fostering
diverse communities.
We crafted our Reflect RAP
to promote education and
cultural awareness in our villages,
empowering both residents and

employees to participate in
reconciliation events. Additionally,
it supports our efforts to establish
meaningful relationships with First
Australian businesses and local
communities, actively supporting
endeavours for reconciliation.
Throughout the plan's development,
we partnered with a local Victorian
artist Sam Richards from the
Wurundjeri and Dja Dja Wurrung
people. The beautiful artwork
she has created, unveiled at
our Chirnside Park Smoking
Ceremony, embodies our core
values of Bringing the best of life,
Strong enough to care, and One
team, and symbolises Summerset
communities, illustrating staff
and residents coming together
to share knowledge, strengths,
and experiences.

EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY

Embedding
sustainability
We are committed to our sustainability goals
and in everything we do aim to be a good
corporate citizen. In 2023 we took further
steps to embed sustainability and sustainable
practices across our business.
We have also taken further steps
to enhance our reporting to give
our staff, residents, shareholders
and other interested stakeholders an
understanding of our sustainability
performance and activities.
In May 2023 we released our
Sustainability Review FY18–22 which
documented the first five years
of our sustainability journey since
we began measuring our impacts
in 2017. This was our first steps
into ESG (environmental, social
and governance) reporting, and
shows how we are contributing and
working to have an impact beyond
just the environmental aspects of
our operations.
In 2023 the government legislated
new disclosure requirements for
large listed companies to outline the
potential negative impacts and risks
of climate change on business and
society, and how we will mitigate and
adapt to the effects.
Alongside this Annual Report we
have released our Sustainability
Review and Climate-Related
Disclosures FY23 document which

includes our mandatory climate
disclosures. We believe the new
disclosures are a positive step in
transparent reporting.

Environment
Summerset has made a number of
changes to mitigate and reduce our
environmental impact.

Below we have provided a
high-level update on our
sustainability activities with more
detailed information available in
the Sustainability Review. Our
Sustainability Review and Climaterelated Disclosures FY23 report
is available on the Summerset
website at www.summerset.co.nz/
investor-centre/esg-reporting/.

Across our villages, construction
sites and offices we have focused
on waste minimisation, carbon
emissions reductions through our
decarbonisation programme and
operational efficiencies, working to
determine how and where we use
water, and protecting and enhancing
our biodiversity efforts.

We were very pleased to be again
recognised by Forsyth Barr in their
second Carbon and ESG Ratings for
NZX-listed companies. We retained
our place at 11th, and were noted
by Forsyth Barr as a "leader"
among NZX-listed companies. We
were also the highest-rated listed
retirement village operator. External
acknowledgement of our work is
very pleasing and helps validate our
approach to date.

Our efforts have been recognised
externally and in 2023 we won two
sustainability awards.
We won a Construction Sector
Beacon Award for our entry titled
“Building out Waste by Thinking
Green”. The Beacons identify
instances of excellence within
the construction industry, offering
valuable lessons and examples for
other companies to follow.
The panel of judges said our entry
showed, “A strong example not only
of collaboration but of sharing and
educating with the wider network for
broader outcomes. A shining

process. Materials like timber create
a lot less embodied carbon than
concrete, for example, during the
building process.

As well as our construction waste
avoidance we have worked hard to
reduce the impact of our existing
villages with LED light replacement
programmes, installation of electric
vehicle (EV) charging points and
working with residents to reduce
and recycle their waste. Residents
across New Zealand have worked
with us on many projects to reduce,
reuse and recycle where they can,
including taking part in NZ Recycling
Week to learn more about how
they can minimise waste and be
more sustainable.

We have measured the embodied
carbon of two of our key housing
types – our Louisville and our standalone villas which are at many of our
sites. We will use this information
to form a baseline figure we can
compare against and to help us
refine future designs and reduce
the embodied carbon found in
these homes.

where we won the
Best Operator-led
Sustainability initiative
Award for our work
over the last five
years to reduce our
carbon emissions.
The judges for this award said
they were impressed with how
much we’d learned, how we had
embedded sustainability across the
organisation, how we have taken
residents on the journey with us, and
our commitment to do more.
We know this is the beginning and
we have more to do. As a business
we’re also looking at how we can
decrease our embodied carbon.
This is the carbon that is used
and created in the construction

As our understanding and work
around sustainability matures, we
want to look at what materials and
other aspects of our operations
we could change to lessen our
longer-term impacts. This might
mean designing out unnecessary
materials or activities, or removing
or phasing out assets that create
emissions, prioritising the use
of energy-efficient equipment or
renewable energy sources, or
choosing materials that have a
longer life cycle, or can be reused
or recycled at end of life.
Water consumption is another focus
for us in the coming years. We
installed water meters at a number
of villages this year and they’re
already providing us with a better
level of understanding of our usage
at village level in the areas of care,
grounds and independent living
residents. Over the next 12 months
we’ll look at how we can make water
savings across the villages.

environmental impact and work see

Social
As a retirement village operator,
it is our impact on our residents,
staff and communities that most
defines us.
This is why one of our three
sustainability goals is focused on

creating caring communities for our
residents and employees.
Summerset supports causes,
charities and organisations that
resonate with our residents and are
part of the local communities of
our villages, including Netball New
Zealand, Hato Hone St John Therapy
Pets, golf clubs, Rotary and more.
As well as the more
than 190 organisations we
support throughout New Zealand,
Summerset's villages and
construction sites play a large part
in the communities they're located
in, employing hundreds of people,
supporting local businesses and
providing high-quality, affordable
homes, which frees up housing
stock elsewhere.
One of our strategic goals is to
“Invest in our people”. We do
this by providing a supportive and
encouraging workplace where they
can grow their careers. We also
want them to be at their best
both at work and at home so we
support our staff’s wellbeing with our
wellbeing hub, encouraging them to
be their full selves in the workplace
with cultural celebrations and
employee representative groups
like our Pride Network. Summerset
managers have also received
Diversity & Inclusion and mental
health awareness training.
Summerset also provides care and
memory care beds across the
country to not only provide peace of
mind to our residents that they can
access help if their needs change,
but to provide a supportive, dignified
and enjoyable care experience for
them and their family.
While Summerset is committed
to providing aged care, and can
continue to do so, it is getting
very difficult for smaller providers
to continue operating due to
inadequate funding. Summerset,
along with a number of other aged
care providers, supported the New
Zealand Aged Care Association’s

45

Annual Report 2023

Domino Effect campaign this year to
highlight the effects that a lack of
aged care beds has on the wider
health system.
With aged care beds closing around
the country it will mean that more
elderly people will need to be
cared for in hospitals, reducing
the capacity for other people to
receive much needed health care.
We continue to advocate for our
industry so we can all continue the
important work of aged care across
New Zealand.

impact and work, see page 12 of our
Sustainability Review and Climaterelated Disclosures FY23 report.

Governance
To ensure we remain on track
and meet our ambitious goals,
strong governance and oversight
is essential.
Summerset has a Sustainability
Forum made up of executives, senior
managers and other critical staff
who are responsible for leadership,

coordination and advice on our
sustainability initiatives.
This team is overseen by the
Summerset Board who receive sixmonthly updates and reporting
against our sustainability strategy.
In addition Summerset’s Executive
team are responsible for delivering
sustainability projects in their
business units.
For more information on our
sustainability governance see page
16 of our Sustainability review
and Climate-related Disclosures
FY23 report.
Our emissions profile
Summerset’s total emissions in
2023 were 102,926 tCO2e, which
is an increase from our 2017 base
year (5,381 tCO2e1). As Summerset’s
portfolio grows and the number
of villages in operation increases,
our scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions
will continue to increase. However,
the growth in emissions per
square metre of developed land
decreased 58% when compared
to our base year of 2017 due to

FY17 has been restated as a result of historical emission factor changes

greater construction, operational
efficiencies and the sourcing of
renewable energy. In 2023 we
disclosed our full value chain scope
3 emissions for the first time,
including category 1 capital goods,
2 purchased goods and services,
and employee commuting category
7. This has resulted in a significant
change to our emissions profile.
With most of our greenhouse gas
emissions now in our value chain,
we started work on establishing
our procurement sustainability
programme to work with our
suppliers to drive down our scope
3 emissions and innovate lower
carbon products and services.
We have commenced our supplier
engagement programme through
national and regional supplier
forums focused on both material
and product suppliers as well as
service providers. We work hard to
build strong relationships with our
suppliers and through this approach
we will successfully encourage
our supply chain to continually

EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY

Continued progress on our
medium-term target
Our medium-term (2028) targets
are based on our sustainability
linked lending facility. We were the
first retirement village operator in
New Zealand to link sustainability
to our funding arrangements, and
during the year further illustrated
our commitment by extending the
facility for a further two years. All our
bank funding is now sustainabilitylinked.

Our sustainabilitylinked lending allows
us to get favourable
rates by linking
sustainability targets
to our medium-term
business strategy. It is
also a way of keeping us
accountable externally.

After more than achieving our
previous five-year target of a 5%
reduction in carbon emissions
intensity across scopes 1, 2 and
selected 3 per $m of revenue by
2023, our new five-year target of a
34% reduction in emissions intensity
per square metre by 2027 on
baseline year 2022 is more ambitious
and meets the Science Based Target

There are three key deliverables
associated with this arrangement:
ongoing dementia certification and
increasing supply of dementia beds;
reduction in our emissions intensity;
and a reduction in construction
waste going to landfill.
We are very pleased with our
progress – we have done an
excellent job in reducing our
construction waste and all 17 New
Zealand sites we worked on this
year practiced waste avoidance
and onsite source separation.
Since we implemented our site
separation policy in 2021, over 6,000
tonnes of waste has been diverted
from landfill.
Similarly, we met our carbon
emission intensity reduction targets
and we’ve set ambitious goals for the
coming years to reduce further.
We continue to be dementia
accredited and we opened memory
care centres at our Te Awa and
Bell Block villages. We plan to open
more memory care beds in 2024
at Papamoa and St Johns so we
are confident in meeting this target
going forward.

Our long-term goals
We introduced our long-term
science-aligned target in late 2020.
This target means we have
committed to reducing our
emissions intensity by 62% per
square metre by 2032, from our 2017
base year.
With electricity use being a key
element of our carbon footprint we
recognise that we will need to move
to more renewable energy sources
to achieve our science-aligned
target. We have taken a number of
steps to start this process, including
the introduction of a biomass boiler
that uses wood pellets, and this
year we’ve successfully introduced
solar panels on the pool house at
our Karaka village, the pool and
gym building at our Manukau village
and on the main building at our
Richmond village.

Our Richmond village is
the first to have solar
panels on the main
building and they’re
already seeing savings
in kWh usage and cost
on our electricity bills.
We’ve also scoped solar panels
to be installed at all our future
main buildings, with Whangārei and
Cambridge the first two to be
delivered in the coming years. We
recognise reducing our absolute
emissions is a challenge, particularly
when we’re growing so quickly and
reducing our reliance on the national
grid will help us to achieve this goal.
Other initiatives this year
We continue to replace the
Summerset village fleet with EVs and
we’ve installed more EV charging
points at villages around the country.
We now have nine villages with an
EV available for residents to use as
part of our car sharing programme.

EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY

We anticipate a further 10 EVs to be
delivered into villages in 2024.

more people riding to work and living
healthier lives.

Our residents are also keen to help
with sustainability initiatives. At our
Avonhead village we realised that
waste diversion was very low, so staff
and residents worked together on
the barriers that were in place. With
simple changes like more recycling
bins, food collection stations and
more regular waste collections from
our property team, the village was
able to increase their diversion from
15% to 68% in a matter of months.

We continue to look for
opportunities in our new and existing
villages to increase biodiversity.

We worked to educate and engage
our staff about how they can be more
sustainable too – completing our first
commuting survey to understand
how our people get to work and
how we can educate them on
more sustainable travel. Following
this survey, we are investigating
a number of actions including
the implementation of a staff
Workride scheme, an employee
benefit scheme designed to get

At our Waikanae village we replanted
a mahoe forest adjacent to the
village and have seen significant
growth over the past year.
Our commitment to sustainability
extends to our Australian villages
too, with all villages being designed
so they are gas free and 100%
electric. Our Australian villages
will also integrate initiatives such
as drought-resistant landscaping,
reticulated greywater use (where
available), rainwater collection for
use in the village, and waterefficient fittings and fixtures used
throughout. Our Cranbourne
North construction site is part of
our very successful construction
waste avoidance initiative, achieving
landfill diversion rates of above 90%
across the recent reporting period.

We’re very pleased with the work
we’ve done to date, and we remain
committed to leading positive
change within our industry.
As a business we’ll continue our
regular reporting and improving the
activities and initiatives we’re already
undertaking dedicated to ongoing
investigation and experimentation
with new methods and technologies
that will help us in achieving our
sustainability goals and ensure we
continue to advance our corporate
citizenship in both New Zealand
and Australia.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Summerset has delivered another
year of strong financial performance
and maintained balance sheet
resilience despite a challenging
operating environment.
Financial performance overview
Underlying profit for the year ended
31 December 2023 increased by 11%
on the prior year to $190.3 million
(2022: $171.4 million), driven primarily
by record new sales and resales in
the year. New sales increased by
23 units on the prior year (+4%),
while resales increased by 73 on
the prior year (+16%). We maintained
our delivery of units to a similar
rate on prior year of 643 (2022:
625). Realised gains on investment
property are $209.4 million (2022:
$175.1 million). Revenue for the
year grew 14% to $272.2 million
(2022: $238.7 million), reflecting
village revenue growth from
deliveries within our developing
villages and continued high rates
of care occupancy in existing
villages. Profits from operations have
reduced slightly on prior year, with
three new care centres opening,
which incur large fixed costs while
occupancy builds up. We continue
to see wages and costs increasing at
a rate higher than the increases to
public funding, in particular nurses
wages, council rates, insurance,
and power.
Long-term growth
A key component of underlying
profit is the realised development
margin on new sales, which was
$121.2 million in 2023 (2022:
$104.9 million). The increase was
driven by higher volume of new
sales on last year (+23 units) and
improving margins from higher sales
prices across the portfolio. The
development margin was 31.6%,
up from 29.7% in the previous
year. We expect that development
margins will be maintained within
the 20–25% range over the
medium term. Good margins

reflect the advantage of having
strong in-house capabilities for
each stage of village development
including land acquisition, planning,
consenting, design, procurement
and construction management.
We continue to work to manage
cost inflation across our build
pipeline through leveraging from
scale, standardisation and mature
procurement planning.

Summerset continues
to maintain the
largest land bank
for a retirement
village operator in
New Zealand.
We acquired two new sites in
New Zealand in 2023. These
are Rolleston (Christchurch) and
Mosgiel (Dunedin). This brings our
total land bank to 6,909 units.
Summary of sales
and developments
Summerset had another record
sales year, with 1,103 unit sales of
occupation rights (2022: 1,007), 560
of them new unit sales and 543
sales of existing units. Average gross
proceeds per new sale settlement
of $686,000 was up from $658,000
in 2022 due to higher sales prices
across all product types, in particular
in villa sales, where the average
sale price increased to $843,000
from $730,000 in 2022. Realised
resale gain increased by 26% to
$88.1 million in 2023. Average gross
proceeds per resale settlement were
$587,000, up 5% from 2022. Key
development milestones included
the delivery of the Te Awa, and Bell
Block main buildings along with the
start of construction at two new
villages, Rangiora (Christchurch),
and Blenheim. For developing
villages still under construction, new
unit sales were particularly strong at

Bell Block (Taranaki), Cambridge, and
Te Awa (Hawke’s Bay). In Australia
we delivered our first units at
Cranbourne North, and expect first
residents in March 2024
Net profit after tax
Summerset recorded a net profit
after tax of $436.3 million for the year
ended 31 December 2023, up from
$269.1 million in 2022. This increase
is largely due to the large fair
value recognised in 2023. Fair value
movement in 2023 of $441.6 million
reflects the delivery of retirement
units in the financial year as well as
pricing, the uplift in land bank and
growth rate assumptions.
Business growth and expenses
Summerset derives its revenue from
selling units (deferred management
fees) and providing village and
care services. The company’s
revenue increased as a result
of higher volumes, reflective
of the continuing growth and
scale of our operations. Deferred
management fees on Summerset’s
units sold under occupation right
agreements were $104.6 million
in 2023 (2022: $92.3 million). The
growth reflects the increase in
the number, occupancy and value
of Summerset’s portfolio of units.
Underlying profit is a non-GAAP
measure. A detailed explanation
is included in Note 2 to the
Financial Statements (see page 65).
In general terms, underlying profit
removes the fair value movement of
investment property and reinstates
the realised gains associated with
our resales and the development
margin associated with our new
sales. Underlying profit is used
to determine the dividend payout
to shareholders.
Summerset’s total unit portfolio
reached 7,371 (2022: 6,679), and
at year end there were only 408
new units and 156 resale units
available for sale. Occupancy in our
mature care centres was 93% (2022:

51

Annual Report 2023

92%), which is above the industry
average of 90%. Total expenses were
managed well, increasing by 17% to
$263.8 million in 2023 (2022:
$225.7 million), mainly driven by the
increased care wage costs at a rate
above the level of public funding
increases, and general cost growth
across head office functions. We
continue to experience growing
employee costs due to tight labour
conditions, higher rates across our
properties and increased insurance
premiums. We incurred $0.5 million
of one-off operational costs due to
the impact of Cyclone Gabrielle.

Net cash from operating activities
Summerset’s net cash from
operating activities was
$398.2 million for the year, up 8%
from 2022 (2022: $369.2 million).
This was principally driven by
increased receipts from residents
but reduced by increased costs
of providing care. Summerset is
a growth company and reinvests
operating cash flows back into
the business to finance future
growth. In 2023 Summerset invested
$668.5 million, primarily in relation
to new and existing retirement
villages and care centres (2022:
$651.7 million).

OUR PERFORMANCE

Assets rose to $6.9 billion
Total assets rose 19% to $6.9 billion
at 31 December 2023 (2022:
$5.8 billion), mainly due to growth
in the size and value of Summerset’s
investment property, which reached
$6.4 billion (2022: $5.4 billion).
At balance date, Summerset also
had property, plant and equipment
valued at $403.2 million (2022:
$326.1 million), most of this being
care centres (these are operated
to provide services and are
therefore not included as investment
property). An increased embedded
value of $1.6 billion (2022: $1.5 billion)
demonstrates future cash that
can be generated when units
are resold. Interest-bearing debt
of $1,393.5 million was 20% of
total assets at year end (2022:
$1,060.5 million). The year-end debt
at face value is made up of
$949.0 million of bank borrowings
and $450.0 million of retail bonds.
Summerset also has residents' loans
of $2.5 billion (2022: $2.2 billion).
This is in the form of licences paid
by residents under occupation right
agreements. These are repayable
when residents vacate units and
the associated occupation rights
are resold.
2023 dividends
Summerset will pay a final dividend
of 13.2 cents per share (cps) on
22 March 2024, making a full
payout for the 2023 year of 24.5
cps (2022: 22.3 cps). Board policy
for shareholder distributions was
reviewed during the year and the
payout range updated to 20–50%
of each year’s underlying profit. The
2023 distribution of $57.3 million
represents 30% of underlying profit
($190.3 million), which is consistent
with the last seven years. Summerset
continues to offer shareholders
a dividend reinvestment option,
including a 2% discount to market
share price.

Annual Report 2023

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Accounting policies
Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and that are relevant to the understanding of the financial
statements are provided throughout the accompanying notes.
The accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the periods presented in these financial statements.
The Group adopted all mandatory new and amended NZ IFRS Standards and Interpretations and there has been no material impact
on the Group's financial statements.
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and are not yet effective, that are expected to have
a significant impact on the Group.
During the period, the Group reviewed its cash flows from operating activities disclosure. The Statement of Cash Flows presentation
has been amended to more accurately reflect the nature of the cash flows and to assist users of the financial statements. Previously
cash receipts received from residents relating to expected deferred management fees were included in the receipts for residents’
loans categories. This has now been split into its own category.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The principal areas of judgement in preparing these
financial statements are described in the following notes:

64

•

Deferred management fees – Note 4

•

Deferred taxation – Note 7

•

Interest rate swaps – Note 15

•

Leases – Note 17

•

Revenue in advance – Note 4

•

Valuation of investment property – Note 12

•

Valuation of buildings – Note 10

•

Valuation of retail bonds – Note 18

•

Valuation of asset held for sale - Note 9

Comparative information
The Statement of Cash Flows presentation has been amended to separately disclose cash receipts from residents relating to deferred
management fees. This amendment has been applied retrospectively and the impact on the comparative periods is shown below:

Underlying profit

Underlying profit is a non-GAAP measure and differs from NZ IFRS profit for the period. Underlying profit does not have a standardised
meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by other entities.
The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure in addition to IFRS profit to assist readers in determining the realised
and unrealised components of fair value movement of investment property, impairment and tax expense in the Group’s income
statement. The measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures to monitor performance and make investment
decisions. Underlying profit is a measure that the Group uses consistently across reporting periods. Underlying profit is used to
determine the dividend pay-out to shareholders.
This statement presented is for the Group, prepared in accordance with the Basis of preparation: underlying profit described below.

Basis of preparation: underlying profit
Underlying profit is determined by taking profit for the period determined under NZ IFRS, adjusted for the impact of the following:
a)

Less fair value movement of investment property: reversal of investment property valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS profit
for the period, which comprise both realised and non-realised valuation movements. This is reversed and replaced with realised
development margin and realised resale gains during the period, effectively removing the unrealised component of the fair
value movement of investment property.

b)

Less reversal of impairment of assets: remove the impact of non-cash care centre valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS profit
for the period. Care centres are valued annually, with fair value gains flowing through to the revaluation reserve unless the gain
offsets a previous impairment to fair value that was recorded in NZ IFRS profit. Where there is any impairment of a care centre, or
reversal of a previous impairment that impacts NZ IFRS profit for the period, this is eliminated for the purposes of determining
underlying profit.

c)

Add realised gain on resales: add the realised gains across all resales of occupation rights during the period. The realised gain
for each resale is determined to be the difference between the licence price for the previous occupation right for a unit and the
occupation right resold for that same unit during the period. Realised resale gains are a measure of the cash generated from
increases in selling prices of occupation rights to incoming residents, less cash amounts repaid to vacated residents for the
repayment of the price of their refundable occupation right purchased in an earlier period, with the recognition point being
the cash settlement. Realised resale gains exclude deferred management fees and refurbishment costs.

d)

Add realised development margin: add realised development margin across all new sales of occupation rights during the
period, with the recognition point being the cash settlement. Realised development margin is the margin earned on the first
time sale of an occupation right following the development of a unit. The margin for each new sale is determined to be the
licence price for the occupation right, less the cost of developing that unit.
Components of the cost of developing units include directly attributable construction costs and a proportionate share of the
following costs:
◦

Infrastructure costs

◦

Land cost on the basis of the purchase price of the land

◦

Interest during the build period

◦

Head office costs directly related to the construction of units

All costs above include non-recoverable GST.
Development margin excludes the costs of developing common areas within the retirement village (including a share of the
proportionate costs listed above). This is because these areas are assets that support the sale of occupation rights for not just

65

Annual Report 2023

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
the new sale but for all subsequent resales. It also excludes the costs of developing care centres.
Where costs are apportioned across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the
nature of the cost.
Where a unit not previously sold under occupation right agreement is converted to a unit sold under occupation right
agreement, realised development margin recognised on the new sale of these units includes the following costs:

e)

◦

Conversion costs

◦

A fair value apportionment reflecting the value of the property immediately prior to conversion

Add/(less) deferred tax expense/(credit): reversal of the impact of deferred taxation.

Underlying profit does not include any adjustments for abnormal items or fair value movements on financial instruments that are
included in NZ IFRS profit for the period.

3. Segment reporting
The Group operates in one industry, being the provision of integrated retirement villages. The services provided across all of the
Group’s villages are similar, as are the type of customer and the regulatory environment. The chief operating decision makers, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Board, review the operating results of the Group as a whole on a regular basis. On this basis, the Group
has one reportable segment, and the Group results are the same as the results of the reportable segment. All resource allocation
decisions across the Group are made to optimise the consolidated Group’s result.
The Group continues to proceed with its expansion into Australia with seven sites purchased to date. These sites are currently being,
or will be, developed into retirement villages. To date the activities in Australia have been immaterial to the Group and so are not
reported as a separate operating segment as at 31 December 2023.

66

Te Whatu Ora is a significant customer of the Group, as the Group derives care fee revenue in respect of eligible government
subsidised aged care residents. Fees earned from Te Whatu Ora for the year ended 31 December 2023 amounted to $44.3 million
(2022: $36.1 million). No other customers individually contribute a significant proportion of the Group revenue. All revenue is earned
in New Zealand, apart from a small amount of interest income earned in Australia.

4. Revenue
Care fees and village services income are charged to residents on a monthly basis, as agreed, and are recognised over time. A portion
of village services is considered lease income based on the nature of the services provided.
Deferred management fees, which entitle residents to accommodation and the use of the community facilities within the village,
are recognised over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue.
The expected periods of tenure, being based on historical Group averages, are estimated to be seven to eight years for villas,
five years for apartments, three years for serviced apartments and memory care apartments, and two years for care suites. Where
the deferred management fees over the contractual period exceed the amortisation of the deferred management fee based on
estimated tenure, the amount is recorded as a liability (revenue in advance). At balance date, the majority of the revenue in advance
balance is non-current.

Borrowing costs are capitalised for property, plant and equipment (Note 10), and investment property (Note 12), if they are directly
attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities
to prepare the asset commence and expenditure and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Borrowing costs of $51.0 million (2022: $25.5 million) have been capitalised during the period of construction in the current year. The
weighted average capitalisation rate on funds borrowed representing the borrowing costs of the loans used to finance projects is
5.09% per annum (2022: 3.42% per annum).
Two of the Group's retail bonds are designated in a fair value hedging relationship. Details of fair value hedging are included in Note 15.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
7. Income tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax, calculated using the tax rate enacted or substantively enacted at balance date and
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, except when it relates to
items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the tax expense is recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax expense is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable it will be utilised. Temporary differences for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit, unless they arise from business combination, are not provided for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

8. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Trade receivables are not significant on an individual
basis and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate, less an
allowance for doubtful debts. The allowance for doubtful debts is made up of expected credit losses based on assessment of trade
receivables debt at the individual level for impairment, plus an additional allowance on the remaining balance for potential credit
losses not yet identified. The expected credit losses allowance requirement on the remaining balance has been set at 2%.

9. Asset held for sale
Following a review of the Group’s land portfolio, land at Parnell in Auckland is being held for sale. The land is being actively marketed
for sale and a sale is expected to take place within 12 months. The land is being held at its fair value. The fair value of the land was
determined by independent registered valuers Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (“JLL”) using the direct comparison approach.

10. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes care centres (including memory care apartments and care suites), both complete and under
development, and corporate assets held.
All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
of the asset. The cost of self-constructed care centres includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to
bring the care centres to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest
during the build period and head office costs directly related to the construction of the care centres. Where costs are apportioned
across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, completed care centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of
the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, since the assets were
last revalued. Other corporate assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if

any. Where an item of plant and equipment is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the income statement is calculated as the
difference between the net sales price and the carrying amount of the asset.
Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence, which is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged
between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction as at the valuation date.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset
previously recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement unless it directly offsets
a previous surplus in the same asset in other comprehensive income. Any accumulated depreciation at revaluation date is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal,
any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings. Independent valuations are
performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the asset’s fair value at the
balance sheet date.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line (SL) basis over the estimated useful life of each item of property,
plant and equipment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are
reassessed at each reporting date.
Major depreciation rates are as follows:
•
•

Buildings (2% to 14% SL)
Motor vehicles (8% to 10% SL)

•
•

Furniture and fittings (7% to 20% SL)
Plant and equipment (7% to 50% SL)

Also included in the buildings category is building fit-out.
Right of use assets are depreciated on an SL basis over the term of their lease. Refer to Note 17.

Carrying amounts

Buildings include $51.1 million of care centres under development carried at fair value, which reflects cost due to the proximity of
completion to 31 December 2023 (2022: $49.4 million).
Right of use assets relate to the Group's leased office premises, car park spaces and plant and equipment; refer to Note 17 for
further information.

Classification between investment property and property, plant and equipment
On initial recognition, the Group performs an assessment to determine whether a unit type should be classified as investment
property or property, plant and equipment. The assessment is based on the significance of ancillary services provided to residents
who occupy accommodation under an occupation right agreement. For the purposes of this assessment, the Group considers
that portion of weekly fees that gives rise to a separate performance obligation for the Group, as ancillary services. In addition
to a quantitative assessment, the business model (being the provision of accommodation) is considered when determining the
classification of the property as either investment property or property, plant and equipment. Subsequent reclassification of unit
types between investment property or property, plant and equipment, occur only when there has been a change in use.

Revaluations
An independent valuation to determine the fair value of all building assets related to completed care centres was carried out as at
31 December 2023 by CBRE Limited ("CBRE NZ"), an independent registered valuer. Valuations are carried out annually.
CBRE NZ determines the fair value of care centres (excluding units under occupation right agreement) using an earnings-based
multiple approach and the amount apportioned to goodwill is not recognised. Significant assumptions used in the most recent
valuation are included in the table below:

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
As the fair value of buildings is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised property, plant and
equipment as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolio of care centres (excluding units under occupation right agreement) are the capitalisation rates applied to
individual unit earnings and the market value per care bed. A significant decrease (increase) in the capitalisation rate would result in
a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the market value per care bed would
result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the
entity’s portfolio of units under occupation right agreement, held as property, plant and equipment, are the discount rates and growth
rates. A significant decrease (increase) in the discount rate would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement,
and a significant increase (decrease) in the growth would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Other key
components in determining the fair value of units under occupation right held as property, plant and equipment are the average entry

73

Annual Report 2023

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
age of residents and the average occupancy of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the occupancy period of units would result
in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents
would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

11. Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on an SL basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date
that they are available for use. The intangible assets are software and the amortisation rates at 31 December 2023 are between 10%
and 20% SL basis.

Investment property is held to earn current and future rental income and capital appreciation. It comprises land and buildings,
and associated equipment and furnishings, relating to retirement units and common facilities in the retirement village. Investment
property includes buildings under development, excluding care centres under development which are included in property, plant
and equipment. Initial recognition of investment property is at cost and it is subsequently measured at fair value, with any change in
fair value recognised in the income statement.
The cost of retirement units includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to bring the retirement units
to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest during the build period
and head office costs directly related to the construction of the retirement units. Where costs are apportioned across more than one
asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Land acquired with the intention of constructing investment property on it is classified as investment property from the date
of acquisition.
Depreciation is not charged on investment property.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.

1 Included in development land are pieces of land that were acquired close to balance date. These pieces of land have been accounted for at fair value, which has been
determined to be cost due to the proximity of the transaction to balance date. At 31 December 2023 the land at cost was $35.7 million (2022: $162.5 million).
2 Included in retirement villages measured at fair value is $5.4 million related to completed retirement units at cost, which reflects fair value due to the proximity of completion

The Group is unable to reliably determine the fair value of the non-land portion of retirement villages under development at
31 December 2023 and therefore these are carried at cost, with the exception of one site due to its advance stage of construction.
This equates to $526.3 million of investment property
(2022: $462.9 million).
The fair value of investment property as at 31 December 2023 was determined by independent registered valuers CBRE NZ and JLL
for villages including land in New Zealand, and CBRE Valuations Pty Limited ("CBRE AU") and Jones Lang LaSalle Australia Pty Limited
("JLL AU") for land in Australia. The fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on a semi-annual basis, based on market
values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing buyer
and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently
and without compulsion.
As required by NZ IAS 40 - Investment Property, the fair value as determined by the independent registered valuer is adjusted for
assets and liabilities already recognised on the balance sheet which are also reflected in the discounted cash flow analysis.
To assess the fair value of the Group's interest in each New Zealand village, CBRE NZ and JLL have undertaken a discounted cash flow
analysis to derive a present value. The Group's development land has been valued by CBRE NZ using the direct comparison approach.
One of the sites under development has been valued using the residual approach where a number of blocks were valued as work in
progress together with residual land. The value of the work in progress was calculated as the market value of completed stock less
selling expenses, and an allowance for profit and risk, holding costs, and costs to complete including a contingent sum. Previously
land at this site was valued using the direct comparison with any development measured at cost. The change in valuation approach
provides a more fair and accurate representation of fair value at balance date.
The valuers' view is that the markets both nationally and globally are being heavily impacted by high interest rate rises instigated by
central banks to combat inflation. Markets are also impacted by ongoing disruption to global supply chains and geopolitical instability
in certain regions, particularly the ongoing war in Ukraine and recent events in Gaza. With these factors in mind, the valuers reiterate
that their conclusions are based on data and market sentiment as at the date of the valuation and that a degree of caution should
be exercised when relying upon the valuation.
Significant assumptions used by CBRE NZ and JLL in relation to the New Zealand investment property are included in the table below:
2023

2022

Discount rate

13.5% - 16.5%

13.5% - 16.5%

Growth rate

0.5% - 3.5%

Average entry age of residents

73 years - 91 years

73 years - 88 years

Stabilised departing occupancy periods of units

3.8 years - 8.7 years

3.9 years - 8.6 years

Sites under development in Australia have been valued separately by CBRE AU and JLL AU. Land is valued under the same
methodology as development land in New Zealand.
As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are significant and unobservable, the Group has categorised
investment property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
To assess the market value of the Group's interest in a retirement village, CBRE and JLL have undertaken a discounted cash flow
analysis to derive a present value.

Difference (%)

1 Adopted value differs to figures in other notes. It is the value of completed units, net of related resident liability. The amount does not include unsold stock, work in progress
or development land.

Other key components in determining the fair value of investment property are the average entry age of residents and the average
occupancy of units. A significant decrease (increase) in the occupancy period of units would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair
value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents would result in a significantly higher
(lower) fair value measurement.

Operating expenses
Direct operating expenses arising from investment property during the period amounted to $66.5 million (2022: $57.7 million).

Security
At 31 December 2023, all investment property relating to registered retirement villages under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are
subject to a registered first mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor to secure the Group’s obligations to the occupation right
agreement holders.

15. Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swaps are initially
recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value on each reporting date.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined based on cash flows discounted to present value using current market
interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its floating rate debt. These interest
rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. When interest rate swaps meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective
portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to reserves are transferred out of reserves and included in the
measurement of the hedged transaction when the forecast transaction occurs. When interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for
cash flow hedge accounting, all movements in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.
78

Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
variable rates and to pay interest at fixed rates. At 31 December 2023, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with a
total notional principal amount of approximately $847.0 million, made up of $497.0 million denominated in NZD and $350.0 million
in AUD (2022: $762.3 million, made up of $442.0 million denominated in NZD and $320.3 million in AUD). Of the swaps in place,
at 31 December 2023 $673.4 million (2022: $535.5 million) are being used to cover approximately 71% (2022: 78%) of the floating
rate debt principal outstanding. These agreements effectively change the Group’s interest exposure on the principal covered by the
interest rate swaps from a floating rate to fixed rates, which range between 0.56% and 4.93% (2022: 0.56% and 4.85%).
The fair value of these agreements at 31 December 2023 is a $1.9 million asset, comprised of $11.9 million of swap liabilities and
$13.8 million of swap assets (2022: asset of 26.5 million, comprised of $0.7 million of swap liabilities and $27.2 million of swap assets).
Of this, a liability of nil is estimated to be current (2022: nil). The agreements cover notional amounts for terms of up to seven years.

Fair value hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its fixed rate debt arising from the retail
bonds. The hedge is for the future fair value movements in the retail bonds as a result of market interest rate movements. The Group
has designated $300.0 million of its retail bonds in fair value hedge relationships.
Both the hedging instrument (interest rate swap) and the hedged risk are recognised at fair value. The change in the fair value of both
items offset in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent the hedging relationship is effective. The increase in fair value
of the interest rate swaps of $10.4 million (2022: reduction of $11.8 million) has been recognised in finance costs and has been offset
with a similar fair value gain on the retail bonds to leave an ineffective amount in finance costs of nil (2022: nil).
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
fixed rates and to pay interest at floating rates. At 31 December 2023, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with
a total notional principal amount of $300.0 million (2022: $225.0 million). Of the interest rate swaps in place, at 31 December 2023
$300.0 million (2022: $225.0 million) are being used to cover 67% (2022: 60%) of the fixed interest rate retail bonds outstanding.

16. Residents’ loans
Residents’ loans are amounts payable under occupation right agreements. An occupation right agreement confers a right of
occupancy to a villa, apartment, serviced apartment, care suite or memory care apartment. The consideration received on the grant
of an occupation right agreement is allocated to the resident's loan in full. These loans are non-interest bearing and are payable when
both an occupation right agreement is terminated and there has been settlement of a new occupation right agreement for the same
unit and the proceeds from the new settlement have been received by the Group. Residents’ loans are initially recognised at fair value
and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

80

The Group holds a contractual right to set-off the deferred management fee receivable on termination of an agreement against the
resident's loan to be repaid. Residents’ loans are therefore recognised net of the deferred management fee receivable on the balance
sheet. Deferred management fees are payable by residents in consideration for the supply of accommodation and the right to share
in the use of community facilities. Deferred management fees are paid in arrears, with the amount payable calculated as a percentage
of the resident's loan amount as per the resident's occupation right agreement. Deferred management fee receivable is calculated
and recorded based on the current tenure of the resident and the contractual right to deferred management fee earned at balance
date. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on recognition of deferred management fee revenue.

17. Leases
The leases to which NZ IFRS 16 applies are the leases of plant and equipment and office premises and car parks occupied by the Group
in New Zealand and Australia. In respect of these leases, a right of use asset is disclosed along with a corresponding lease liability.
The right of use assets are depreciated on an SL basis, while the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments
that are not yet paid, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.
The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months
or less and certain leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as incurred as
a rental expense over the lease term.
Right of use assets primarily relate to the Group's leased office premises and are classified as property, plant and equipment, and lease
liabilities are disclosed as such in the Group's statement of financial position.
When the Group has the option to extend a lease, management uses its judgement to determine whether or not an option would be
reasonably certain to be exercised. Management considers all facts and circumstances, including their past practice and any cost
that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help determine the lease term. Other assumptions and
judgements used by management include calculating the appropriate discount rate.

As a lessor
The Group acts as a lessor under occupation right agreements with village residents, along with a small number of residential rental
properties. The assets leased by the group as a lessor are disclosed as investment property and lease income on occupation right
agreements is generated in the form of deferred management fees and a portion of care fees and village services. The lease term
is determined to be the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue. The Group allocates individual
leases of units to village residents to different portfolios depending on the type of unit. The Group does not have any subleases.

18. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings include secured bank loans and unsubordinated fixed-rate retail bonds.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to
initial recognition, the borrowings are measured at amortised cost, with any difference between the initial recognised amount and the
redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest rate. Two of the three
retail bonds, SUM020 and SUM040, are designated in fair value hedge relationships, which means that any change in market interest
rates results in a change in the fair value adjustment of that debt. SUM030 is not hedged. Transaction costs incurred in arranging
financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant debt instrument.

The bank loans and retail bonds rank equally with the Group’s other unsubordinated obligations and are secured by the following
securities held by a security trustee:
•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is not a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages
Act 2003;

•

a second-ranking registered mortgage over the land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages Act
2003 (behind a first-ranking registered mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor);

•

a first-ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group member;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group members; and

•

a Specific Security Deed in respect of each marketable security of Summerset Holdings (Australia) Pty Limited, held by
Summerset Holdings Limited.

19. Financial instruments
Exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board adopts policies for
managing each of these risks as summarised below.

Categories of financial instruments

Financial assets
All financial assets of the Group are classified at amortised cost except for interest rate swaps and investments, which are classified
as fair value through profit and loss, and those assets that are designated in a hedge relationship.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities except interest rate swaps and retail bonds are classified as liabilities at amortised cost. Refer to Note 18 for detail
on the retail bonds.

Credit risk

84

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a resident or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual
obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk relates to receivables from residents and bank balances. The Group manages
its exposure to credit risk. The Group’s cash is held with its principal banker, with the level of exposure to credit risk considered
minimal, with low levels of cash generally held. Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and funds are placed
with high-credit-quality financial institutions. The level of risk associated with sundry debtors is considered minimal due to the
recoverability of this balance being assessed as high. The Group does not require collateral from its debtors and the Directors
consider the Group’s exposure to any concentration of credit risk to be minimal.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The status of trade receivables is as follows:

In summary, trade receivables are determined to be impaired as follows:

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by seeking to obtain the most competitive rate of interest at all times. The Group
has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to provide an effective cash flow hedge against the variability in floating
interest rates. The Group has also entered into other interest swap agreements to reduce interest rate repricing risk in relation to retail
bonds. See Note 15 for details of interest rate swap agreements.
To comply with the Group’s risk management policy, the hedge ratio is based on the interest rate swap notional amount to hedge
the same notional amount of bank loans or retail bonds. This results in a hedge ratio of 1:1. This is the same as used for actual risk
management purposes, and such a ratio is appropriate for the purposes of hedge accounting as it does not result in an imbalance
that would create hedge ineffectiveness.
In these hedge relationships the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
•

a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship;

•

where the hedge instrument has been transacted on a date different to the rate set date of the bank loan or retail bonds, interest
rates could differ; and

•

differences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.

Other than these sources, due to the alignment of the hedged risk in the hedged item and hedged instrument, hedge ineffectiveness
is not expected to arise.
At 31 December 2023 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’s
profit by approximately $9.4 million (2022: decrease by $6.7 million) and increase total comprehensive income by approximately
$16.7 million (2022: increase by $14.3 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity
by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk on residents’ loans and related
sundry debtors through the contractual requirements of occupation right agreements, whereby a resident’s loan is repaid only on
receipt of the loan monies from the incoming resident.

obligations on bank loans and retail bonds):

Residents’ loans

Total

Residents’ loans are non-interest bearing and are not required to be repaid following termination of an occupation right agreement
until receipt of cash for the new resident loan from the incoming resident. Residents' loans are classified as being repayable on
demand, and therefore fully repayable within 12 months, because the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer repayment
of residents' loans for at least 12 months after balance date. Based on historical information including estimated periods of tenure
as disclosed in Note 4, it is estimated that $191.2 million (2022: $202.8 million) is expected to become payable in the 12 months
following balance date. To date, cash for new residents’ loans received has exceeded cash to repay residents’ loans, net of deferred
management fees.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of the Group's assets, liabilities and financial performance will fluctuate due to changes
in foreign currency rates.
The Group is primarily exposed to currency risk through its subsidiaries in Australia.

Annual Report 2023

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
The risk to the Group is that the value of the overseas subsidiaries' financial position and financial performance will fluctuate in
economic terms and as recorded in the Group financial statements due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Due to limited activity
in the Australian subsidiaries in 2023, the Group did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange risk.

The fair value of retail bonds is based on the price traded at on the NZX market as at 31 December 2023. The fair value of the retail
bonds is categorised as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using inputs from third parties that are observable, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Based on this, the Company and Group have categorised these financial instruments as Level 2
under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of investments is categorised as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value
Measurement and its fair value is measured using valuation techniques based on discounted future cash flow forecasts and various
unobservable inputs.

Capital management
86

The Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings. The objective of the Group’s capital management is
to ensure a strong credit position to support business growth and maximise shareholder value. The Group is subject to capital
requirements imposed by the bank lenders (through covenants in the Syndicated Facility Agreement) and bondholders (through
covenants in the Master Trust Deed). The Group has met all of these externally imposed capital requirements for the year ended
31 December 2023 (2022: all requirements met). The Group capital structure is managed, and adjustments are made, with Board
approval. There were no changes to objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: none).

20. Share capital and reserves
At 31 December 2023, there were 234,281,382 ordinary shares on issue (2022: 232,116,894). All ordinary shares are fully paid and have
no par value. All shares carry one vote per share and carry the right to dividends.

22. Employee share plans
Senior employee share plan - share option scheme
The number of options granted to each participant equals the incentive remuneration value divided by the volume weighted average
price on the NZX during the 10 trading day period. Where applicable, the exercise price of the granted share options is determined
from the volume weighted average price on the NZX during the 10 trading day period determined by the Board prior to the grant.
Effective from the 2021 annual option grant, the option exercise price is set at nil and therefore no option valuation is required.

Options outstanding as at 31 December 2023 have a weighted average remaining life of 2.46 years (2022: 1.93 years).
For the 2023 annual option grant, the following performance hurdles apply to all participants:
•

75% of each Tranche will vest based on absolute total shareholder return performance

•

25% of each Tranche will vest based on relative total shareholder return performance

For annual option grants made between 2018 and 2020, while there is a requirement to remain employed by Summerset up to vesting
date, there are no performance hurdles for vesting of share options to senior management team members, other than the members
of the Executive Leadership Team.
For certain one-off option grants outside of the annual option grant process, performance hurdles are set relating to specific
performance milestones for the relevant Participant.
The maximum terms for options granted range between three and six years.
The share option scheme is an equity-settled scheme and measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at
the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate that
the share options will vest. Where applicable, these options were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the option cost
for the year ending 31 December 2023 of $2,782,606 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the Group
for that period (2022: $2,147,000). The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the share options in cash.

All-staff employee share plan
The Group operates an all-staff employee share plan. A total of 1,944 employees participated in the share issue under the plan for
the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: 1,706 employees). In 2023, the Group contributed $1,000 per participating employee
(being the total value of the shares issued). A total of 188,568 Company shares were issued under the scheme at $10.27 per share
(2022:167,188 shares at $10.16 per share). The shares are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited and vest to participating employees
after a three-year period.
The cost for the year ending 31 December 2023 of $891,000 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the
Group for that period (2022: $566,000).

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Shareholders of Summerset Group
Holdings Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Summerset Group Holdings Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the
Group”) on pages 56 to 90, which comprise the statement of financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and the income
statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended
of the Group, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements including material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements on pages 56 to 90 present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial
Reporting Standards.
This report is made solely to the Company's shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company's shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's
shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of Ethics for Assurance
Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Ernst & Young provides IFRS training, other assurance and remuneration advisory services to the Group. Partners and employees of
our firm may deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. We
have no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of
the audit report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to
respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures,
including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Annual Report 2023

Valuation and classification of investment property and freehold land and buildings
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

As disclosed in notes 10 and 12 of the consolidated
financial statements:

To address the key audit matter, we:

•

the Group’s investment property portfolio was valued
at $6,407 million at 31 December 2023 and included
completed investment property and investment
property under development.

•

the Group’s care centre buildings were valued at
$359 million at 31 December 2023. This included
completed care centre buildings operated by the
Group for the provision of care services and care
centres under development.

Independent valuations of all investment property
and completed care centre buildings were carried
out by third party valuers, CBRE Limited and Jones
Lang LaSalle Limited (the Valuers). The valuation of
investment property and care centre buildings is
inherently subjective given that there are alternative
assumptions and valuation methods that may result in
a range of values.
Properties which are externally valued are recorded in
the consolidated financial statements based on the value
determined by the Valuers.

92

Investment property and care centre buildings under
development that are not substantially progressed to
enable fair value to be reliably determined are carried at
cost less any impairment.
Summerset derives revenue from properties it holds in the
form of both deferred management fees and the provision
of services to residents. NZ IAS 40 requires properties to
be classified as an investment property where the revenue
from the supply of ancillary services is insignificant to the
arrangement as a whole. Judgement is required to assess
the significance of ancillary services in this context.

External valuations
•

read the valuation reports and discussed them with
the Valuers. We assessed the valuation approach and
confirmed that this was in accordance with the relevant
accounting standards; and

•

tested, on a sample basis, whether property specific
information supplied to the Valuers by the Group
reflected the underlying property records of the Group.

Assumptions and estimates
•

held discussions with the Valuers to gain an
understanding of the assumptions and estimates used
and the valuation methodology applied. We also sought
to understand and consider whether any restrictions had
been imposed on the valuation process;

•

considered whether the valuation incorporated
appropriate assumptions for a sample of individual
properties to reflect their characteristics, overall quality,
geographic location and desirability as a whole; and

•

engaged our in-house Real estate valuation experts to
challenge the work performed by the Valuers and assess
the reasonableness of the assumptions used based
on their knowledge gained from reviewing valuations
of similar properties, known transactions and available
market data.

Our work over the assumptions focused on the largest
properties within the portfolio and those properties where the
assumptions used and/or year-on-year fair value movement
suggested a possible outlier compared to the rest of the
portfolio and the market data for the sector.
Estimated valuation range
As a result of the judgement involved in determining
valuations for individual properties and the existence of
alternative assumptions and valuation methods, there is a
range of values which can be considered reasonable when
evaluating the independent property valuations used by the
Group. If we identified an error in a property valuation or
determined that the valuation was outside of a reasonable
range, we evaluated the error or difference to determine
if there was a material misstatement in the consolidated
financial statements.
Classification and measurement
We considered management’s assessment of the
classification of each type of property as either investment
property or care centre buildings. This included assessment
against the requirements of the accounting standards,
and where relevant considering the significance of
ancillary services.
We also considered management’s assessment of whether
the fair value of investment property under development
could not be reliably determined.

Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Disclosures
We considered the adequacy of the disclosures in notes
10 and 12 to the financial statements. These notes explain
the key judgements made in relation to the classification
and valuation of investment property and freehold land
and buildings and the estimation uncertainty involved in
this process.

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the Annual Report, which includes information other than the consolidated financial
statements and auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge
obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based upon the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the entity, for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting
Standards, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing on behalf of the entity the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the External
Reporting Board’s website: https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards-for-assurance-practitioners/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/.

Governance
Summerset has adopted the principles below as an appropriate way to demonstrate its commitment to best practice
governance and to provide transparency in the Company’s approach to corporate governance for the benefit of its
shareholders and other stakeholders. These principles are from the NZX Corporate Governance Code issued in April
2023 ('NZX Code'). Each principle of the NZX Code is set out below with an explanation on how Summerset meets it.
As at 31 December 2023, Summerset considers that it was in full compliance with NZX Listing Rules and the NZX Code.
The Code of Ethics Policy, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines, Whistle Blowing
Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, Modern Slavery Policy and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy can be found on the
Company’s website and internal intranet alongside other governance documents.

Principle 1: Ethical standards
'Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management
accountable for these standards being followed throughout the organisation.'
Ethical standards
The Board maintains high standards of ethical conduct and expects the Company’s employees to act legally and
with integrity in a manner consistent with the policies, guiding principles and values that are in place. These include
the following:
94

•

Code of Ethics – This guide sets out the basic principles of legal and ethical conduct expected of all employees
and Directors. The Company encourages open and honest communication by staff about any current or potential
problem, complaint, suggestion, concern or question.

•

Diversity and Inclusion Policy – This policy outlines the Company’s guiding principles for diversity and inclusion.
Refer to Principle 2 for further details.

•

Securities Trading Policy – In accordance with the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, the NZX Listing Rules and
the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, Directors and employees of the Company are subject to limitations on
their ability to buy or sell Company shares.

•

Whistle Blowing Policy –This policy encourages employees to come forward if they have concerns regarding
serious wrongdoing, and ensures that employees have access to a confidential process in which they can report
any issues in relation to serious wrongdoing without fear of reprisal or victimisation.

•

Supplier Code of Conduct and Modern Slavery Policy – These documents set out the minimum standards
expected of Summerset’s suppliers and support Summerset’s commitment to sustainable, ethical and
inclusive procurement.

•

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy – This policy sets out Summerset’s zero-tolerance approach to bribery and
corruption. It also makes clear that donations to political parties are not permitted.

•

Code of Conduct – This policy sets out the expected behaviours while in employment with the Company.
Company employees are expected to act honestly, conscientiously, reasonably and in good faith, while at all times
having regard to their responsibilities, the interests of Summerset, and the welfare of our residents and staff.

•

Gift Policy – This policy governs the acceptance and reporting of benefits given to staff by third parties.

•

Conflicts of Interest – Summerset's Code of Ethics outlines the standards of integrity, professionalism and
confidentiality to which all employees and Directors of the Company must adhere with respect to their work and
behaviour. To maintain integrity in decision-making, each Director must advise the Board of any potential conflict
of interest if such arises. If a conflict of interest exists, the Director concerned will have no involvement in the
decision-making process relating to the matter.

•

Interests Register – In accordance with the Companies Act 1993 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013,
the Company maintains an Interests Register in which all relevant transactions and matters involving the Directors
are recorded.

Principle 2: Board composition and performance
'To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience
and perspectives.'
Role of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is elected by Shareholders and has responsibility for taking appropriate steps to protect and
enhance the value of the assets of the Company in the best interests of its Shareholders. The Board has adopted
a formal Board Charter detailing its authority, responsibilities, membership and operation. The key responsibilities
of the Board include setting the overall direction and strategy of the Company, establishing appropriate policies
and monitoring performance of management. The Board appoints the CEO and delegates the day-to-day operating
of the business to them. The CEO implements policies and strategies set by the Board and is accountable to it.
The Board also has responsibility for ensuring the Company’s financial position is sound, and financial statements
comply with generally accepted accounting practice, and that the Company adheres to high standards of ethical and
corporate behaviour.
A summary of the Board protocols is as follows:
•

A majority of the Board should be Independent Directors as defined in the NZX Listing Rules,

•

The Chair of the Board should be independent,

•

The Chair and the CEO should be different people,

•

Directors should possess a broad range of skills, qualifications and experience, and remain current on how best to
perform their duties as Directors,

•

Information of sufficient content, quality and timeliness, as the Board considers necessary, will be provided by
management to allow the Board to discharge its duties effectively, and

•

The effectiveness and performance of the Board and its individual members should be re-evaluated on an
annual basis.

Directors receive an induction upon appointment to the Board to ensure their full knowledge of the Company and the
industry in which it operates. The Directors are expected to keep themselves abreast of changes and trends in the
business and to keep themselves up to date to ensure they best perform their duties as Directors of the Company.
All Directors have been issued letters setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment.
Delegation of authority
The Board delegates to the CEO responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy and for managing the Company’s
operations. The CEO and management have Board-approved levels of authority and, in turn, sub-delegate authority
in some cases to direct reports. This is documented in the Delegated Authority Policy.
Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution and the NZX Listing Rules, Directors are required to retire three years
after their appointment or at the third Annual Shareholder Meeting following their appointment (whichever is later).
Directors who have been appointed by the Board must also retire at the next Annual Shareholder Meeting following
their appointment.
The Board Charter states that it is not generally expected that a non-executive Director would hold office for more than
ten years or be nominated for more than three consecutive terms. The Board Charter also provides that Directors may
accept other board appointments only where that does not detrimentally affect their performance as a Director of
Summerset. In making this assessment, the number and nature of a Director’s other governance roles may be relevant.
Directors may offer themselves for re-election by Shareholders each year at the Annual Shareholder Meeting.
Procedures for the appointment and removal of Directors are also governed by the Constitution.
The People and Culture Committee identifies and nominates candidates to fill Director vacancies for Board approval.
Information about candidates for election or re-election is included in the Notice of Meeting to assist Shareholders in
deciding whether or not to elect or re-elect the candidate.

Annual Report 2023

Board composition
The Company’s Constitution prescribes that the Board shall be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, with at
least two Directors ordinarily resident in New Zealand. As at 31 December 2023, the Board was comprised of seven
non-executive Independent Directors. In determining whether a Director is Independent, the Board has regard to the
NZX Listing Rules and factors described in the NZX Code.
The Board considers all current Directors to be Independent in that they are not executives of the Company and do
not have a direct or indirect interest or relationship that could reasonably influence (or be perceived to influence), in
a material way, their decisions in relation to the Company.
As at 31 December 2023, the non-executive Independent Directors were Mark Verbiest (Chair), Dr Andrew Wong,
Gráinne Troute, Fiona Oliver, Dr Marie Bismark, Stephen Bull and Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley.
Andrea Scown is a Future Director under the Institute of Directors’ Future Directors programme, which aims to develop
New Zealand’s next generation of directors and provide experience in large companies around the country. Andrea
joined the Board as a Future Director in November 2022. Future Directors fully participate in all Board matters but do
not have voting or decision rights.
The Board comprises Directors who have a mix of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity to adequately meet and
discharge its responsibilities and to add value to the Company through efficient and effective governance leadership.
The current Directors have a varied and balanced mix of skills relevant to the Group’s operations. A summary of the key
skills and experience held across the Board as at 31 December 2023, is set out in the table on the following page.

More information on the Directors, including their interests, qualifications and security holdings, is provided on our
website and in the Disclosures sections of this report. As a term of their appointment, Directors are required to acquire
and hold shares in the Company to the value of one year’s worth of director fees, though the Board has the ability to
waive this requirement and would do so in the appropriate circumstances. They have two years in which to acquire
the shares. Once this requirement has been achieved at a point in time, it is deemed satisfied and is not affected by
future fluctuations in share price. This shareholding requirement may be satisfied by a Director holding shares through
an associated person or entity.
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings. The Directors generally receive material for Board meetings five working
days in advance, except in the case of special meetings, for which the time period may be shorter owing to the urgency
of the matter to be considered.
The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings, and in this capacity is accountable directly to the Board, through
the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board.
All Directors have access to the Executive Leadership Team to discuss issues or obtain information on specific areas
in relation to items to be considered at Board meetings or other areas as considered appropriate. Key executives and
managers are invited to attend and participate in appropriate sessions at Board meetings. Directors have unrestricted
access to Company records and information.
Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice relating to the affairs of the Company or other
responsibilities. Prior approval of the Chair is required before seeking such advice and Directors are expected to ensure
that the cost of such advice is reasonable.
Diversity and inclusion
The Company and its Board are committed to a workplace culture that promotes and values diversity and
inclusiveness. This is outlined in the Company’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which is available on the
Company’s website.
Diversity is defined as the characteristics that make one individual different from another. Diversity encompasses
gender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, physical capability, family responsibilities, education, cultural
background and more.
Inclusion is defined as a sense of belonging, respecting and valuing all individuals, providing fair access to opportunity,
and removing discrimination and other barriers to involvement. The Board recognises that inclusion leads to a better
experience of work for Summerset’s employees, makes teams stronger, leads to greater creativity and performance,
contributes to a more meaningful relationship with residents, their families and stakeholders, and ultimately increases
value to Shareholders.
The Board believes that diversity across the workforce makes Summerset stronger and better able to connect with,
and bring the best of life to, residents on a day-to-day basis. When there is a variety of thinking styles, backgrounds,

97

Annual Report 2023

experiences, perspectives and abilities, employees are more able to understand residents’ needs and to respond
effectively to them.
The Diversity and Inclusion Policy states that the objective of Summerset’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy is to:
'Actively engage, communicate and develop our people leaders and our employees to enhance the awareness
and understanding of diversity and inclusion that enhances our organisational culture and positively contributes to
delivering the “best of life” for our customers.'
To help Summerset's leaders lead their increasingly diverse and multi-cultural teams and support diversity and
inclusion the Company started its "Creating an Inclusive Workplace" training programme for all managers in 2023. The
programme helps leaders to deepen their understanding of others and create an inclusive team environment where
all team members feel valued, appreciated, and can contribute to bringing the best of life for residents.
Summerset also supported the establishment of employee representative groups including the Summerset Pride
Network, and continued work of the Women in Construction Forum. Both groups aim to seek equity and inclusion
through building awareness of the challenges, celebrating the successes, and supporting the ideas of these groups.
Each year the Board reviews and assesses performance against the financial year objectives. The Board considers that
for the year ended 31 December 2023, the objectives for achieving diversity have been met.
As at 31 December 2023 (and 31 December 2022 for the prior comparative period), the mix of gender of those
employed by the Company is set out in the table on the following page.
The Executive Leadership Team comprises the CEO, the CFO and all General Managers who report to the CEO.
These figures include permanent full-time, permanent part-time, fixed-term and casual employees, but not
independent contractors.

Board performance
The Board is committed to evaluating its performance on a regular basis, generally with a formal, external review
bi-annually and an internal self-review each intervening year. The process, including evaluation criteria, is considered
by the People and Culture Committee and approved by the Board.
Executive Leadership Team performance
The Board evaluates the performance of the CEO annually. The CEO reviews the performance of direct reports, and
reports to the Board on those reviews. The evaluation is based on criteria that include the performance of the business
and the accomplishment of longer-term strategic objectives. It may include quantitative and qualitative measures.
During the most recent financial year, performance evaluations were conducted in accordance with this process.

Principle 3: Board committees
'The Board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining
Board responsibility.'
Board committees
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit and Risk Committee, the People and Culture Committee, the
Clinical Governance Committee, and the Development and Construction Committee. Each committee operates
under a charter approved by the Board, and any recommendations they make are to the Board. The charter for each
committee is reviewed annually. All Directors are entitled to attend committee meetings.
Audit and Risk Committee
While the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting rests with the Board,
the Company has in place processes to ensure the accurate presentation of its financial position. These include:
•

An appropriately resourced Audit and Risk Committee operating under a written charter, with specific
responsibilities for financial reporting and risk management;

•

Review and consideration by the Audit and Risk Committee of the financial information and preliminary releases
of results to the market, before making recommendations to the Board;

•

A process to ensure the independence and competence of the Company’s external auditors and a process to
ensure their compliance with the Company’s External Audit Independence Policy (available on the
Company’s website);

•

Responsibility for appointment of the external auditors residing with the Audit and Risk Committee;

•

Monitoring by the Audit and Risk Committee of the strength of the internal control environment by considering
the effectiveness and adequacy of Summerset’s internal controls, reviewing the findings of the external auditor's

audit programme;

•

Ensuring that management has established a risk management framework and monitoring the Company’s risk
profile and reporting of risk, including new and emerging sources of risk (including climate risk).

One of the main purposes of the Audit and Risk Committee is to ensure the quality and independence of the external
audit process. The Committee makes enquiries of management and the external auditors so that it is satisfied as to the
validity and accuracy of all aspects of the Company’s financial reporting. All aspects of the external audit are reported
back to the Audit and Risk Committee and the external auditors are given the opportunity at Committee meetings to
meet with Directors.
The Audit and Risk Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors, the majority of whom must be
Independent. The Committee is chaired by an Independent Director who is not the Chair of the Board. The Committee
currently comprises, Fiona Oliver (Chair), Mark Verbiest, Gráinne Troute, Stephen Bull and Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley.
The Audit and Risk Committee generally invites the CO, CFO and General Manager Corporate Services, Head of
Finance, internal auditors and external auditors to attend meetings. The Committee also meets and receives regular
reports from the external auditors without management present, concerning any matters that arise in connection with
the performance of their role.
People and Culture Committee
The role of the People and Culture Committee is to assist the Board in establishing and reviewing remuneration
policies and practices, culture, leadership and capability, succession, employee development, inclusion, diversity and
engagement for the Company and in reviewing Board composition. Specific objectives include:
•

Supporting the Board in ensuring the Company's vision and commitment to its people strategy is aligned with, and
an enabler of, the Company's business strategy;

•

Assisting the Board in planning the Board’s composition;

•

Evaluating the competencies required of prospective Directors (both non-executive and executive);

•

Identifying those prospective Directors and establishing their degree of independence;

•

Developing the succession plans for the Board, and making recommendations to the Board accordingly;

•

Overseeing the process of the Board’s annual performance self-assessment and the performance of the Directors;

99

Annual Report 2023

•

Assisting the Board in establishing remuneration policies and practices, and setting and reviewing the
remuneration of the Company’s CEO, Executive Leadership Team and Directors; and

•

Monitoring remuneration policy and practice and making recommendations to the Board in relation to any
substantive changes.

The People and Culture Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors, the majority of whom must
be Independent. The Committee currently comprises Gráinne Troute (Chair), Mark Verbiest, Dr Marie Bismark and
Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley. The Board’s policy is that the Board needs to have an appropriate mix of skills, experience
and diversity to ensure that it is well equipped. The Board reviews and evaluates on a regular basis the skill mix required,
and identifies any existing gaps.
Clinical Governance Committee
The role of the Clinical Governance Committee is to assist the Board in ensuring a systematic approach to maintaining
and improving the quality of care provided by the Company. Specific objectives include:
•

Providing oversight that appropriate clinical governance mechanisms are in place and are effective throughout
the organisation;

•

Supporting the leadership role of the Chief Executive Officer in relation to issues of quality, safety and clinical risk;

•

Working with management to identify priorities for improvement;

•

Ensuring that the principles and standards of clinical governance are applied to the health improvement and health
protection activities of the Board;

•

Ensuring that appropriate mechanisms are in place for the effective engagement of representatives of residents
and clinical staff.

The Clinical Governance Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors. The Committee currently
comprises Dr Marie Bismark (Chair), Gráinne Troute, Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley and Dr Andrew Wong.
100

Development and Construction Committee
The role of the Development and Construction Committee is to assist the Board in:
•

Supporting management to establish and achieve development and construction objectives within the
Company’s long-term plan;

•

Supporting management to develop and implement strategies to achieve the Company’s development and
construction objectives in line with best practice;

•

Helping the Company maintain appropriate risk management strategies to identify, mitigate and manage
development and construction risks;

•

Maintaining a good understanding of, and confidence in, the Company’s frameworks, systems, processes and
personnel required to manage the Company’s development and construction activities effectively, including the
assessment and realisation of opportunities and the application of appropriate risk management;

•

Working with management to identify areas for improvement and innovation in construction and
development practices.

The Development and Construction Committee must comprise a minimum of three Directors. The Committee
currently comprises Stephen Bull (Chair), Mark Verbiest, Fiona Oliver, Venasio-Lorenzo Crawley and Dr Andrew Wong.

Principle 4: Reporting and disclosure
'The Board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance
of corporate disclosures.'
101

Making timely and balanced disclosures
The Company is committed to promoting Shareholder confidence through open, timely and accurate market
communication. The Company has in place procedures designed to ensure compliance with its disclosure obligations
under the NZX and ASX Listing Rules. The Company’s Market Disclosure and Communications Policy sets out the
responsibilities of the Board and management in disclosure and communication, and procedures for managing
this obligation.
Copies of key governance documents, including the Code of Ethics, Securities Trading Policy and
Guidelines, Board and Committee Charters, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Board and Executive Remuneration
Policy, and Market Disclosure and Communications Policy are all available on the Company’s website
at www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/governance-documents.
Non-financial disclosures, such as the Company’s approach to health and safety, our people, the community and the
environment are included within this Annual Report and in our separate Sustainability Review and Climate-Related
Disclosures FY23 document available at www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/esg-reporting/.

Principle 5: Remuneration
'The remuneration of Directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.'
Remuneration of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team is reviewed by the Board’s People and Culture
Committee. Its membership and role are set out under Principle 3. The committee makes recommendations to the
Board on remuneration packages, keeping in mind the requirements of the Board and Executive Remuneration Policy.
The level of remuneration paid to the Directors and the Executive Leadership Team will be determined by the Board.
However, Directors’ fees must be within the limits approved by the Shareholders of the Company.
Further details on remuneration are provided in the Remuneration section of this Annual Report (page 110).

Annual Report 2023

Principle 6: Risk management
'Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them.
The Board should regularly verify that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential
and material risks.'

102

The Board is responsible for overseeing the management of risks across Summerset’s business. Summerset has
robust risk management and reporting frameworks in place, whereby material business risks are regularly identified,
monitored and managed. Summerset’s Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for providing oversight over the
Company’s risk management framework and compliance with that framework. Key risks are regularly reported to
the Board, together with Summerset’s approach to risk management. Summerset introduced its refreshed Risk
Management Policy and its Enterprise Risk Framework in 2023, consistent with best practice principles set out in the
ISO31000:2018 Risk Management Standard.
The members of Summerset’s Executive Leadership Team are required to regularly identify the major risks affecting
the business, record them in the Risk Register (which identifies the likelihood and consequence of each risk to
Summerset’s business), and develop structures, practices and processes to manage and monitor these risks.
Summerset has a co-sourced model for internal audit and an in-house Risk and Assurance Manager. As part of
the co-sourced model, Summerset has engaged KPMG as its partner to assist with carrying out internal audit work
on various parts of the Group’s operations, and all major risk and internal control issues are reported on at each
Board meeting.
Health and safety (including in relation to risks, performance and management) is discussed regularly at Board
meetings and specific reviews are sought as required. Monthly reporting is prepared and used to assist in risk
management, covering areas such as health and safety incidents, injury and near-miss frequency rates, and actions
undertaken. Further information is covered in the health and safety section of this Annual Report on page 27.
Summerset has a Tax Governance Policy in place, which sets out its tax risk management objectives, tax reporting
requirements to the Audit and Risk Committee, and policies and processes to manage tax risk. This Tax Governance

Policy is reviewed by the Board every two years. The Board is satisfied that Summerset has effective policies and
processes in place to ensure the Company is meeting its obligations. Summerset adopts a risk-averse stance in relation
to tax issues and, where possible, seeks certainty on tax positions through proactive engagement with tax authorities.
Summerset has considered whether it has any material exposure to economic, environmental and social sustainability
risks (as defined in the ASX Corporate Governance Principles) and has determined the following:
•

Climate change risk – Summerset expects to operate in a climate that will progressively experience more acute
challenges and risks arising from increasing climate variability. This is likely to have various impacts on the longerterm plans and operation of the Group – specifically in relation to the design, build and construction of villages, as
well as in the provision of care services to frail residents and the overall lifestyle satisfaction enjoyed in Summerset’s
villages. For more information on how Summerset is managing climate change risks and opportunities please
review our Sustainability Review and Climate-related Disclosures FY23 found at www.summerset.co.nz/investorcentre/esg-reporting/

•

Property market risk – Property market factors could adversely affect sales volumes, occupancy levels or
prices. This may have a flow-on impact to the value of Summerset’s property assets and the associated property
valuations, which would in turn impact Summerset’s financial performance.

•

Staff retention and capability risk – In a tight and highly competitive labour market, Summerset is at risk of staff
shortages. Key areas within our construction and nursing teams will continue to be monitored closely.

•

Corporate governance and compliance risk – Failure to comply with regulatory, societal and investor
expectations in relation to corporate governance and environmental sustainability could impact Summerset’s
reputation and financial performance over the longer term. Summerset's governance procedures are
continually monitored.

•

Strategy and innovation risk – There is a moderate risk with regard to Summerset’s strategic direction and ability
to continue to innovate. Summerset’s intention is to stay at the forefront in all areas of its business, including
technology, design, development and care. Summerset fosters a culture of continuous improvement and invests
in innovation through a programme that enables the organisation to anticipate and respond to changes.

•

Diversity and inclusion risk – While our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and annual plans fulfil all our obligations
in this area and we continue to improve our culture, there is always some level of risk, particularly in a tight labour
market. This will continue to be monitored regularly through staff surveys and employees being actively engaged
in this area. Pages 99 and 100 provide more information on the Company's Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.

•

Construction and development risk – Summerset faces construction and property development risks when
developing new villages. These risks include project delays, default risk, governance and design risk, and
potential labour and materials shortages.

•

Clinical care risk – This is a high-risk area for Summerset, which requires constant monitoring, management
and policy review. Good training and professional development, retention of staff, and investment in health and
safety all help mitigate risk in this area. The increasing level of investment required in this area is likely to affect
care profitability.

•

Resident and customer experience risk – Providing top-level resident and customer experience at all times is a
challenge due to the nature of the organisation. Summerset has various methods in which it manages and monitors
these issues closely, including move-in surveys, ongoing resident feedback surveys, close one-on-one feedback
sessions, and close contact with residents, families, next of kin and prospective residents.

•

Health and safety risk – The health, safety and wellbeing of our people and residents remain a top priority and
require systematic approach and strategic focus to ensure continued compliance with relevant legislation.

•

Executing Australian growth risk – Scaling and managing the ongoing growth of the Australian business and
associated business risks. Summerset is mitigating risks through having established a local team, entering a
well-researched market, and developing product and service offerings, procedures and processes tailored for the
new market. Progress in Australia is under close management oversight and has tracked well to date.

•

Cybersecurity risk – A cyber-attack may lead to data privacy breaches, loss of integrity / availability of information
or of a control system and business disruption potentially resulting in financial loss or reputational damage
or regulatory action. Summerset actively monitors and manages these risks through its risk management and
reporting frameworks.

•

Asset maintenance and upgrades risk – Summerset has a coordinated approach to asset management and
upgrades in all areas of the business. The Summerset Asset Management Plan dictates likelihood of replacement,
and coupled with reactive maintenance analysis and trending directs a proactive application to our replacement

103

Annual Report 2023

programme. Asset upgrade standards are clearly defined and well documented, and industry accepted national
asset grading methodology is enforced.
•

Sector penetration rates risk – Summerset is fortunate to operate in the high-growth New Zealand retirement
sector. The risk is a declining penetration (or participation) in the market. Current forecasts show this is unlikely to be
the case in New Zealand, but it is a risk to be monitored. Competitors making significant changes to their revenue
models or pricing strategy could impact on the revenue earned by Summerset.

•

Reputational risk – Summerset operates in a sensitive market involving care of vulnerable members of society.
Summerset’s performance and reputation could be adversely impacted should it suffer adverse publicity,
particularly in respect of care or health and safety issues.

•

Regulatory change risk – Changes in regulation could have a material impact on Summerset’s business
operations. Summerset has been actively involved in the regulatory change process in relation to the New Zealand
and Victorian retirement villages legislative reviews and is well placed to comply with the amendments to these
regimes, as well as the amendments to the Australian aged care regime.

Principle 7: Auditors
'The Board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.'
The Board’s relationship with its auditors, both external and internal, is governed by the Audit and Risk Committee
Charter, External Audit Independence Policy and the Internal Audit Charter. These charters and policies set out the
types of engagements that can be performed by the external and internal auditors. The Audit and Risk Committee
actively monitors the amount of any non-audit work completed by the external auditor to ensure that independence
is maintained.

104

The external auditor (Ernst & Young) attends the Company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting and is available to answer
questions from Shareholders in relation to the external audit.
Ernst & Young was first appointed as external auditor of Summerset in 2004. In 2017, a full tender for the external audit
services was completed and Ernst & Young was reappointed through this process. The lead audit partner changed in
2023, with the appointment of Sam Nicolle.
KPMG was appointed in the role of internal auditor of the Company in December 2016. With the establishment of a
co-source model approach to internal audit in 2020, it currently remains the Company's co-source partner. The internal
audit role is governed by the Internal Audit Charter, which states the objectives and scope of internal audit activities.
The primary objective of internal audit is to increase the strength of the Company’s control environment. This is guided
by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Company. The internal audit assists the Company
in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the
effectiveness of its governance, risk management and internal controls. The Internal Audit Programme is set annually
by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Internal Audit Charter sets out the scope of internal audit activities and this encompasses, but is not limited
to, objective examinations of evidence to provide independent assessments on the adequacy and effectiveness of
operations, governance, risk management and control processes for Summerset. This includes evaluating whether:
•

The actions of Summerset’s officers, directors, staff, and contractors comply with Summerset’s policies,
procedures and applicable laws, regulations and governance standards;

•

The results of operations or programmes are consistent with established goals and objectives;

•

Operations or programmes are being carried out effectively and efficiently, with adequate internal controls;

•

Established processes and systems enable compliance with the policies, procedures, laws and regulations that
could significantly impact Summerset;

•

Information and the means used to identify, measure, analyse, classify and report such information is reliable and
has integrity; and

•

Resources and assets are acquired economically, used efficiently and protected adequately.

Principle 8: Shareholder rights and relations
'The Board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders
that encourage them to engage with the issuer.'
Respecting the rights of Shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that its Shareholders understand its activities by communicating effectively with them
and giving them ready access to clear and balanced information about the Company.
To assist with this, the Company’s website is maintained with relevant information, including copies of presentations
and reports. The Company’s key corporate governance policies are also included on the website.
The Company’s major communications with Shareholders during the financial year include its annual and half-year
reports and the Annual Shareholder Meeting. The annual and half-year reports are available in electronic and
hard-copy format.
Communicating with Shareholders
The Company welcomes communication and feedback from Shareholders. The Company’s investor centre (on its
website) provides a Company phone number and email address for communications from Shareholders and investor
relations enquiries. All Shareholder communications are responded to within a reasonable timeframe.
The Company provides options for Shareholders to receive and send communications electronically, to and from both
the Company and its share and bond registrar. The Company’s investor centre includes contact details for Link Market
Services, through which all Company shares and bonds are managed.
Shareholder voting rights
Shareholders have the right to vote on major decisions as required by the NZX Listing Rules. Further information on
Shareholder voting rights is set out in the Company’s Constitution.
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings
Notice of Annual and Special Shareholder Meetings are sent to Shareholders and published on the Company’s website
at least 20 working days prior to the relevant meeting.

Remuneration
Remuneration overview
Report from the Chair
Dear shareholders,
On behalf of Summerset’s People & Culture Committee I am pleased to present our 2023 Remuneration report.
In December 2023 the NZX released a suggested template for the remuneration sections of listed companies’ Annual
Reports which we have opted to follow for our FY23 Report. We believe this is a positive step in transparent and
consistent reporting.
Remuneration objectives
Our remuneration objectives remained consistent in 2023. Summerset’s purpose is to "Bring the Best of Life" to
our residents, and the Board is aware that in order to achieve this we need motivated employees performing at
a consistently high level. Our objective is that reward outcomes for executive and senor leaders are aligned with
outcomes experienced by shareholders, and a competitive and affordable remuneration structure that is equitable
and attractive is an important contributory factor for maintaining this high level of employee engagement.

110

Summerset's executive remuneration is set in accordance with the principles laid out in the People and
Culture Committee Charter. More broadly, remuneration encompasses wages, salaries, incentives, non-reimbursing
allowances, and a range of employee benefits including KiwiSaver. More information on Summerset's staff benefits can
be found on the careers page of the company website1.
Summerset continues to benchmark pay rates to a market median position, while also being cognisant of factors such
as incumbent experience, to create a balance between competitiveness and affordability for the business. During the
year we conducted (with expert external input) our annual market analysis of our pay to ensure we remain appropriately
positioned against the market, and we continued to offer a number of benefits to our staff to differentiate our offering.
Changes to incentive schemes
Through 2023 we have continued to refine our approach to incentives. We assessed our alignment with other listed
companies to ensure we benchmark and balance appropriately in rewarding the performance of the Summerset
Executive and Senior managers. To assist this ongoing process, we sought advice from PwC during the year.
In 2022 we moved to solely financial targets for the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) scheme hurdles. Our work during
2023 included further refining our LTI scheme regarding the comparator companies we use to measure the hurdle
for absolute total shareholder return. This has meant that, starting with our 2023 allocation, we’ve broadened our
comparator group to the NZX50.
We also completed a review of our Short-Term Incentive (STI) scheme that resulted in refining the shared set of key
performance indicators (KPIs) for 2024 and ensuring individual KPIs for the Executive Leadership team are aligned to
our new ten year Strategy. We also looked at the STI weighting for the Executive Leadership team between shared and
individual KPIs to bring them closer to NZX and ASX market practice, as well as the inclusion of some carbon specific
targets for individual KPIs.
Executive KPIs
The 2023 Shared KPIs took a balanced scorecard approach with financial, customer and staff related KPIs. The
performance outcomes against 2023 shared KPIs has been strong with all targets achieving on target performance
and several exceeding targets including our financial targets and retirement unit deliveries.
These KPIs were all stretch targets, and it’s a testament to the strength of the Executive Leadership team, and
their people, that they have continued to achieve so highly in a very difficult macroeconomic environment. The
Executives' achievements against their individual, role-specific KPIs was also very strong, with the majority fully or
partially achieved.

Board fees
Following external benchmarking data we also increased the Board Chair’s fee from $181,200 to $195,000, within the
approved fee pool, to address a relative misalignment. At the time of writing, a market review of Director fees is being
carried out by PWC for the Committee. The outcomes of this review will determine whether an increase to the fee pool
might be sought at the forthcoming Annual Shareholder Meeting.
During the year we also established a Due Diligence Committee to oversee Summerset’s 2023 bond issue. The three
directors on the Committee (Anne Urlwin (replaced on retirement by Mark Verbiest), Stephen Bull and Gráinne Troute)
were each paid a fee of $5,000 (+GST) to recognise the additional responsibilities above and beyond the normal duties
of the Board they were undertaking.

Gráinne Troute
Chair People & Culture Committee

Remuneration Governance
The Board is assisted in delivering its responsibilities and objectives for Executive remuneration by the People
and Culture Committee. The role and membership of this committee is set out in the Governance section of this report.
Summerset’s remuneration policy for members of the Executive Leadership Team provides the opportunity for them to
receive, where performance merits, a total remuneration package in the upper quartile for equivalent market-matched
roles. The People and Culture Committee reviews the annual performance outcomes for all Executive Leadership Team
members, including the CEO. The review takes into account external benchmarking to ensure competitiveness with
comparable market peers, along with consideration of each individual’s performance, skills, expertise and experience.

Executive Remuneration Policy
The remuneration of members of the Executive Leadership Team (CEO and direct reports) is designed to promote
a high-performance culture and to align executive reward to the development and achievement of strategies and
business objectives that create sustainable value for Shareholders.
Total remuneration is made up of three components: fixed remuneration, short-term incentive (STI) and longterm incentive (LTI).
Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of a base salary and benefits. Summerset’s guiding policy is to benchmark fixed
remuneration with reference to the fixed pay market median.
Short-term incentives
Short-term incentives (STIs) are at-risk payments designed to motivate and reward for performance, typically in
that financial year. The target value of an STI payment is set annually, as a percentage of the Executive Leadership
Team member’s fixed remuneration. For 2023, the relevant percentages were 20–30% (2022: 20–30%).
A proportion of the STI (80% for CEO and 40–70% for the other Executive Leadership Team members) is related to
achievement of annual business performance metrics, which aim to align executives to a shared set of KPIs based on
business priorities for the next 12 months. Target areas for the shared KPIs for 2023 are outlined below:

For 2024, the KPI scheme has been adjusted, with the removal of the health and safety and the clinical target areas.
Instead, the Board can now reduce or cancel STI payments where there are concerns around Health and Safety or
Clinical performance. This has effectively strengthened their oversight by granting the Board the explicit ability to
exercise discretion.
There are three performance levels within each target area – gate-opener, on-target and maximum performance – with
100% of the amount allocated to that target area being payable when the on-target level is achieved. Performance
against both financial and non-financial measures is assessed and approved by the Board each year.
The balance of the STI is related to individual performance measures.

112

In the event that gate-opener underlying EBITDA performance against budget is not achieved, no STI payment will be
made. The gate opener is based on achieving 100% of underlying EBITDA performance target (90% pay-out in relation
to this target). In addition, the areas of new sales development margin and the resales net cash pay out 90% on
achievement of performance targets. Including the other targets, this would mean a total pay-out of 94.5%.
A 100% pay-out is based on achieving 110% of the financial targets (*) and meeting all the other KPI target criteria.
The maximum performance levels allow employees to be rewarded for performance above on-target levels.
The maximum amount of an STI payment for an Executive Leadership Team member is 155% of the STI on-target
amount for that Executive Leadership Team member and is based on significant overachievement being 125% or more
of the financial targets (*) and meeting all the other KPI target criteria and individual performance measures.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives (LTIs) are at-risk payments made through a share options plan, designed to align the reward of
Executive Leadership Team members with the enhancement of shareholder value over a multi-year period.

LTI Plan
The Executive Leadership Team members are participants in an LTI option plan. Under this plan, Executive Leadership
Team members are granted share options. These share options are exercisable in relation to shares in Summerset
Group Holdings Limited.
Option grants are made annually, with the value of each grant being set at the date of each grant and determined as a
percentage of the Executive Leadership Team member’s fixed remuneration. For the three annual option grants made
under this plan in 2018, 2019 and 2020, the relevant percentages were 20–40%. Vesting of these share option grants
is subject to achievement of performance hurdles, which are assessed over two and three-year periods.
In 2021 the LTI plan was amended. Options are zero priced and vesting will occur in two tranches at three and four
years. 50% of each tranche vests based on time (retention) and 50% vests based on performance hurdles. The option
grants as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team member’s fixed remuneration ranged from 20% to 30%.
Consistent with prior years, the performance hurdle portion of each tranche is based on the following measures.

50%

Absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget)

20%

Relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group)

10%

Clinical strategy delivery

10%

People (5% staff engagement; 5% staff turnover)

10%

Customer satisfaction (5% village residents; 5% care centre residents)

Each performance hurdle has a gate opener, which if met results in 50% of the options related to that
performance hurdle vesting for that tranche. Where all performance hurdles for a tranche meet gate opener
requirements, and including that tranche's time-based options, a total of 55.6% of that tranche's options vest.
On-target performance of all performance hurdles for a tranche, including that tranche's time-based portion, results
in a total of 74.1% of that tranche's options vesting. 100% of the options for each tranche vests when the absolute
and relative earnings financial performance hurdles (*) achieve 125% (or above) of the on-target performance
requirement, and all other performance hurdles meet their on-target performance criteria – this includes the tranche's
time-based options.
With the change in vesting periods from two and three years to three and four years, the Board approved a
one-off transition grant for existing participants in 2021. The transition grant consisted of two tranches with the first
tranche vesting at two years and the second tranche at three years. The options granted were zero priced and are time
(retention) based with no performance hurdle requirements.
In 2022 the LTI plan was amended to further improve our alignment with other NZX listed companies. Options remain
zero-priced and vesting occurs in two tranches at three and four years. The vesting of all options is now subject to
the achievement of two financial performance hurdles – 75% based on absolute Total Shareholder Return (aTSR) and
25% based on relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) (compared to a defined peer group). Non-financial hurdles and
time-based vesting have been removed.
In 2023 the option grants as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team member’s fixed remuneration ranged
from 20–50% (30%-50% in 2022). The performance hurdles for 2023 are consistent with those in 2022 as explained
above. However, during the year, Summerset sought external and independent advice from PwC to review the
comparator companies we use to measure aTSR. This resulted in a broadening of our comparators to the NZX50.
Performance hurdles are set by the Board with the objective of aligning executive reward to the development
and achievement of strategies and business objectives creating sustainable value for shareholders. The Board
considers the performance hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for shareholders.
For certain one-off option grants outside of the annual option grant process, performance hurdles are set relating
to specific performance milestones for the relevant participant.
In addition to the LTI share option plan in place for Executive Leadership Team members, Summerset also operates an
LTI share option plan for other senior managers. The 2018, 2019 and 2020 grants for senior managers did not have
any performance hurdles. Effective from 2021, and including the changes made in 2022, all senior managers invited to
participate do so on the same terms and conditions as the Executive Leadership Team. In 2023, the number of options
granted based on a percentage of fixed remuneration ranged from 15% to 25% (consistent with 2022).
As at 31 December 2023 138,756 Executive share options vested and are therefore currently exercisable subject
to Board confirmation of satisfaction of performance hurdle achievement and approval.
The Executive Leadership Team includes the CEO. The CEO Remuneration section provides further details of share
option movements under the LTI Plan for the CEO.
Summersets Remuneration Policy relating to the Board and Executive is available to view here www.summerset.co.nz/
investor-centre/governance-documents/. The number of executives to whom this policy applies is nine (9) and Board
members seven (7).
This Remuneration Report contains disclosure of the employees (other than employees who are directors) who
received remuneration and any other benefits in their capacity as employees, the value of which was or exceeded
$100,000 per annum, in brackets of $10,000, as required by the Companies Act 1993.

Chief Executive Officer remuneration arrangements and outcomes
CEO FY23 Remuneration outcomes
This year we have adopted the new NZX reporting guidelines issued in December 2023. This represents a change to
STI and LTI reporting in the CEO remuneration table (below). This table refers to the STI earned in the reporting year,
i.e. the FY23 STI reported will be paid in FY24. Previous annual reports refer to STI paid in the financial year, which may
relate to a previous year's performance. The LTI value in the table refers to the market value, less exercise price of the
vested options within the reporting period at the time of vesting. Previous annual reports record the value of options
issued in the reporting year, at the time of issue.

The table above includes options granted under the LTI plan prior to 29 March 2021, when the CEO took up this role
(previously CFO).
ESG Disclosures
CEO/Worker Ratio
The pay gap represents the number of times greater the CEO remuneration is to the remuneration of an employee
paid at the median of all Summerset employees. For the purposes of determining the median paid to all Summerset
employees, all permanent full-time, permanent part-time and fixed-term employees are included, with part-time
employees remuneration adjusted to a full-time equivalent amount.
At 31 December 2023, the CEO’s salary of $683,612 was 10.97 times (2022: 11.0 times) that of the median employee
salary at $62,296 per annum. The CEO's total remuneration, including STIs and LTIs, of $1,319,562, was 20.24 times
(2022: 20.0 times) the total remuneration of the median employee at $65,210 per annum.
Gender pay gap
Summerset is commited to cultivating a workplace that embraces diversity and inclusivity and acknowledges the
significance of addressing gender pay equity within the unique context of New Zealand and Australia.
We are undertaking a thorough examination of the factors contributing to any gender pay gap that may exist within
our organisation. We are dedicated to fostering an environment that values all employees, and we recognise the
importance of fair compensation and equal opportunities for everyone on our team.
While we are currently in the process of reviewing our internal data, Summerset affirms its commitment to advancing
discussions and initiatives that contribute to a workplace where every individual, irrespective of gender, is accorded
respect and opportunities.

Remuneration bands
The number of employees or former employees (including employees holding office as Directors of subsidiaries), who
received remuneration and other benefits valued at or exceeding $100,000 during the financial year
ended 31 December 2023 is specified in the following table.
The remuneration figures shown in the Remuneration column include all monetary payments actually paid
during the course of the year ended 31 December 2023. The table also includes the value of options granted
to individual employees under Summerset’s LTI Plan during the same period. The table does not include amounts paid
after 31 December 2023 that relate to the year ended 31 December 2023.
The method of calculating remuneration is consistent with the method applied for the previous year.

Annual Report 2023

Director remuneration
The Board of Directors Chair fees were increased by the Board with effect from 1 September 2023. The increase was
made utilising the pool of funds approved by shareholders for payment of Directors fees. As at 31 December 2023, the
maximum aggregate amount of remuneration payable by Summerset to Directors (in their capacity as Directors) was
$904,450 per annum for the non-executive Directors (2022: $904,450) and annualised standard Directors’ fees were
$845,000, inclusive of additional remuneration for committee Chairs (2022: $831,200).
In respect of Australian based Directors, the Board has decided to pay those Directors in Australian Dollars at the
same face value the New Zealand Directors are paid. This results in those Directors receiving slightly higher fees (as
recorded in the table below). As at 31 December 2023, the only Director who received payment in Australian dollars
was Stephen Bull.
As at 31 December 2023, the standard Director fees per annum are as follows:

No additional fees are paid to standing committee members.
Directors’ fees exclude GST, where appropriate. Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for costs directly
associated with carrying out their duties, including travel costs.
Directors and Officers also have the benefit of Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. Cover is for
damages, judgements, fines, penalties, legal costs awarded and defence costs arising from wrongful acts committed
while acting for Summerset. There are some exclusions within the policy. The insurance cover is supplemented by
the provision of Director and Officer indemnities from the Company, but this does not extend to criminal acts.
The Company distinguishes the structure of non-executive Directors’ remuneration from that of executive Directors.
The total amount of remuneration and other benefits received by each Director during the year ended 31 December
2023 is provided below. These amounts reflect actual payments to directors during the year, and consequently,
depending on each Director's quarterly billing cycle, payroll periods and the actual payment date, the amounts
stated may vary between directors and may not be representative of the directors' fees earned for the year ended
31 December 2023.
