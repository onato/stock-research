ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Chair and
CEO Report

Welcome to Summerset’s annual report for the financial year
ending 31 December 2018. We are pleased to report continued sound
financial performance with an underlying profit of $98.6 million, an
increase of 21% on 2017, and a net profit after tax of $214.5m. We now
have more than 5,000 residents who call Summerset home and over
1,400 staff.
You will see some changes in our annual report
this year. Readers of our reports over the last few
years will have noted our continuing investment
in improving our resident experience, the overall
attractiveness of our staff offering, and our
desire to play a greater part in our communities.
In this year’s report we have dedicated sections,
so readers can see our progress in each of
the business and financial, resident, staff and
community realms. We have also amalgamated
the Chair and CEO letters into a single letter
focused on key themes and issues for the
business.
Business and financial performance
Financial performance for the 2018 year has been
strong with the 21% growth in underlying profit
achieved in an environment where property

price growth, in key markets such as Auckland,
has moderated compared to prior years.
This is a pleasing result and due in a large part to
the consistent demand for what we offer.
Our customers are, on average, aged around
80 on entry to a village and it is the desire for
security, care and community that drives their
decision to move into a retirement village.
We note that our net profit after tax of $214.5m
was down 11% on the previous year. This
was due to the moderating property market
which impacted the fair value movement on
investment property.
We sold 339 new occupation rights in 2018, down
slightly on the previous year, and completed 301
resales. The slight dip in new sales was largely due

CHAIR AND CEO REPORT

to timing, some of our larger builds were delivered
late in the year. However, we are seeing continued
good demand for our retirement units. Offsetting
this lower number of new sales were strong
development margins, with a 33.2% development
margin on new sales for 2018 compared to
27.3% in 2017. In the longer term we expect
development margins in the 20%-25% range.

We have previously signalled that we see our build
rate increasing to an average of 600 retirement
units a year. We are on track to achieve this within
the next two to three years. We will continue to
build only when customer demand and financial
return levels are appropriate, but market demand,
viable projects, and our ability to deliver make this
increase a natural progression.

Operating cash flow for 2018
totalled $217.8 million and total
assets reached $2.8 billion.

To support our building programme and meet our
target build rates, we announced the acquisition
of three sites during 2018. These were Te Awa,
Napier and sites in New Plymouth and Papamoa.
In February 2019 we announced the acquisition
of two further sites; Waikanae (on the Kapiti Coast
north of Wellington) and Milldale (near Orewa,
north of Auckland).

The board has declared a final dividend of 7.2
cents per share. This is a total dividend payment
for 2018 of 13.2 cents per share and represents
30% of underlying profit.
In 2018 we built 454 retirement units, in line
with our earlier guidance. This result makes
Summerset the largest builder of retirement units
in New Zealand for 2018. While this is not one of
our goals, the achievement clearly demonstrates
Summerset’s growth since its listing in 2011, when
we built 122 retirement units.

These sites are described in more detail further in
this report. Overall they represent a mix of urban
and attractive regional areas with good underlying
customer demand. These recent acquisitions
bring our total number of greenfield sites to 9,
on top of our 25 villages completed or under
construction.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

As Summerset continues to grow, so will our land
banking programme. We are currently seeing a
range of attractive sites around New Zealand. We
have held back from acquiring smaller urban sites
that would require high rise buildings over the
last few years, due to having a good selection of
these projects in Auckland already (for example
Hobsonville, Ellerslie, St Johns, Parnell). The
pressurised construction market, high vendor
expectations for land prices, and flattening
residential property prices are other factors.

We continue to see good
underlying customer demand
in these areas and expect
this to only pick up over time.
Villages in these urban locations are attractive
and, at the right time, we will return to purchasing
such sites. Having a diverse portfolio in terms of
geography and construction types (ie single-level
units and high-rise urban) has been a strength of
the business. This has meant having the flexibility
to focus our landbanking and growth in the
market providing the best risk-adjusted returns.

Pleasingly we received a number of resource
consent approvals in 2018 with Te Awa (Napier),
Richmond (Nelson), Kenepuru (Wellington) and
Avonhead (Christchurch) all getting the official
go-ahead. Earthworks and civil works have
started on each of these three sites and we have
seen good early customer interest. Our consent
application for the St Johns village in Auckland
was declined. We have appealed this decision
and are engaging with parties in mediation, and
we remain confident of a positive resolution.
The land-use resource consent for our Boulcott
village in Lower Hutt has been referred to the
Environment Court on our request and this case
will be heard in 2019.
Our flagship Parnell project is progressing well. We
have appointed renowned architects Warren and
Mahoney to the project and will have concepts of
the village ready for resource consent lodgement
later this year, or early 2020. Our Parnell village will
provide all the benefits of retirement village living
while taking advantage of the city fringe location
and, its proximity to Parnell village, the Auckland
Domain, and the adjacent train station.

CHAIR AND CEO REPORT

We are still seeing capacity constraints for
construction in many areas of New Zealand with
Auckland being the worst affected. We do not
expect the pressure in the construction market
to reduce in 2019. There were a number of
construction-related company failures in 2018 and
while we have had very limited exposure to any
of these, we believe 2019 may bring more issues
and Summerset will continue to be vigilant in this
area. We maintain strong relationships with our
contractors at all times.

We finished the rollout of two large IT projects
in 2018. VCare, our new resident management
system, has been introduced across all our
villages and corporate offices. It replaced our
previous internally developed system. This has
been an important project with a large dedicated
project team and significant investment. Using
VCare means our nurses and caregivers have
up-to-date health information at their fingertips,
and can record patient notes quickly and easily
for care residents.

Last year we completed our second bond issue
with a seven-year senior bond. The issue attracted
strong demand which saw us take $50m in
oversubscriptions and a final issue size of $125m
and coupon of 4.20%. Our two bonds provide
us an attractive form of funding, with long tenors,
competitive pricing, and attractive terms. They
also diversify the range of funding sources.

We also completed the implementation of a new
Human Resources Information System (HRIS),
transitioning payroll for all staff onto a modern
system; thereby streamlining processes and
improving usability.

The gearing under our banking and bond
covenants remains conservative at 32.3%. This is
considerably below the maximum level of gearing
allowable under our debt agreements of 50%.
Unlike many businesses, our debt position is not
“core” debt but effectively working capital as
it funds only development assets for the business
such as land, work in progress, and completed
retirement units. As such we are able to
reduce our debt levels quickly by altering the
pace of our development business. Given the
increased degree of uncertainty in property and
global markets generally, we plan to maintain a
relatively conservative approach to gearing. This
is designed to protect us against any unforeseen
shocks as well as provide the ability to pursue
attractive opportunities should they emerge. We
believe we are able to achieve our guidance of
building around 600 retirement units per annum
whilst maintaining this conservative approach
to gearing.
Operations and care
Our operations and care business has continued
to perform well with care centre occupancy at
96.3% for 2018.

A government review of care funding is underway
currently, and results are expected for release
in 2019. Our strategy in the care business is to
focus on being a leading provider of quality
care, and investing in facilities, equipment and
people in order to do this. This position ensures
we can charge additional service fees for the
superior care and accommodation we provide.
The strategy has worked well for us and we
will continue to pursue it, given constraints on
government funding.
From a sector perspective, hearings for the
Australian Royal Commission into Aged Care and
Quality and Safety started in January and, as with
their inquiry into banking, we expect there will
be a number of negative revelations. Everyone
has a right to safe, respectful and quality aged
care. We will be following the inquiry very closely
and will continue to invest time into ensuring we
stay ahead of expectations and are providing
services we are proud of.

We will continue to do what
we’ve done since we started
21 years ago – consistently
lifting the quality of retirement
and aged care for older people.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Residents
Bringing the best of life to our residents is our key
focus and we measure our success through
an annual resident satisfaction survey. 2018 results
continued the trend of strong satisfaction levels
with village resident satisfaction at 95% (97% in
2017) and care resident satisfaction at 97% (the
same as in 2017). Over the last few years we have
focused on lifting property standards, resolving
issues faster, and having greater presence of head
office staff with our residents.

We published four editions
of our new quarterly magazine,
Summerset Scene, in 2018,
celebrating the lives of our
amazing residents.

Food and hospitality is an essential part of village
life and we introduced new food providers across
our villages in 2018, including in-house catering
at our Levin and Paraparaumu villages. This has
seen resident satisfaction levels rise and we will
continue to work on lifting standards further in
2019 and beyond.

Our People
Our people strategy is simple – to be the
employer of choice in our sector. Skilled and
experienced staff, who are engaged in their
work, are absolutely critical to our ability to
provide the best of life for our residents. We have
invested heavily in improving what we do for staff
and how we work together. We measure staff
engagement through the Aon survey. In 2015,
our first year using the Aon survey, we had a
credible staff engagement score of 53%. This year
our engagement score was 69%. We are proud
of this result and it puts us in the top quartile of
Australasian employers, as measured against
the 700 Australian and New Zealand companies
participating in the survey.

Summerset was a silver winner
in the Reader’s Digest annual
2019 Quality Service Awards.
We also opened our Casebrook village in
Christchurch and Rototuna village in Hamilton
in 2018 with our first residents now settled in,
and main buildings, including our new memory
care concept, planned for completion towards
the end of this year.
The Summerset brand
In 2017 we rebranded Summerset, introducing
a fresh, vibrant look and feel – with a new logo,
website, redesigned marketing materials, and an
upgraded social media presence on Facebook
and LinkedIn. Our new staff uniforms are
consistent with this branding. The last step of
this rebrand was a new television advertisement
which went to air in late 2018.
We have started tracking our brand penetration,
that is, who knows about us and what they think
about us. Our research shows that people who
know us, like us a lot, but we have the opportunity
to lift awareness in a number of areas around the
country where we are less well known.

The magazine brings the best of our residents’
lives into print each quarter, reminding us all of
the vibrant life lived in our villages.

We continued to strengthen our employment
offering throughout 2018 and benefits now
include free health insurance, funeral cover,
travel voucher prizes, discounts at a range of
Summerset suppliers, a free staff share scheme,
sick leave from the first day of employment, a
day of leave on each staff member’s birthday,
contributions to staff charity fundraising efforts,
and various types of special leave, including
domestic abuse leave.
Last year we also introduced a brand new uniform
for frontline staff from Wellington designer Lucilla
Gray. Developed to better suit the work our staff
undertake each day, it has been well received by
our people. We now have a beautiful, professional,
and tailor-made uniform with enough variation
to suit most people’s tastes. We were delighted
to unveil our new look at the 2018 New Zealand
Fashion Week with Auckland staff providing willing
and able runway models.

CHAIR AND CEO REPORT

We signalled in our 2018 half year report a
growing shortage of care workers, particularly
nurses. The Government is currently considering
placing nurses back onto the long-term skills
shortage list, which would encourage additional
nurses to come to this country. We believe this is a
very important step given the demands for nurses
from the growth in aged care as well as demand
from District Health Boards (DHBs).

In response to the DHB wage
settlement for nurses, we
lifted wages significantly. It is
essential we have a skilled and
stable nurse workforce.
We have made good improvements in the staff
arena in the last few years but have more to do.
Our main focus in 2019 and beyond will be staff
training and development programmes. We will
be greatly assisted in this with the appointment of
a new General Manager Human Resources, Dave
Clegg. Dave was previously General Manager
of People and Culture at leading steel solutions
supplier, Steel & Tube Holdings Limited.

Keeping our people safe is an important aspect of
our work. We have continued our good progress
in health and safety with reductions in Reportable
Injury Frequency Rates (RIFR) and Lost-Time
Injury Frequency Rates (LTIFR) for the third year
running. We introduced compulsory gloves and
glasses on all Summerset construction sites this
year, and completed a pilot of improved training
on moving residents in our care centres. In 2017
we were accepted into the ACC Accredited
Employers Programme. In 2018 we advanced to
secondary status in this programme. This allows
us to manage our own workplace injury claims
and we are now working with specialist WorkAon
to manage assistance for our staff injured at work.
Summerset’s health and safety plans also
incorporate our residents, contractors and visitors.
Everyone who lives at or visits a Summerset
village can be confident the village meets every
health and safety standard.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Summerset’s place in the community
Our villages and residents are part of a wider
community and we believe in playing a positive
role in these communities. Last year we signalled
our intention to lift our social and environmental
presence. To this end we have announced a
number of key partnerships and completed
initiatives in 2018, including:
•

Taking our first steps toward reducing
greenhouse gas emissions through the
Certified Emissions Measurement and
Reduction Scheme (CEMARS)

•

Partnering with Dementia New Zealand, to
provide more education on this growing
disease while reducing the stigma of having it

•

Partnered with Dementia New Zealand and
The New Zealand Dementia Coopoertative
to commission Nielsen to research dementia
perceptions, awareness and understanding in
New Zealand

•

Sponsoring Bowls New Zealand and New
Zealand Indoor Bowls, helping players come
together to enjoy these popular sports

•

A host of community relationships, including
Wellington Free Ambulance, the Orokonui
Ecosanctuary in Dunedin, sports tournaments
and health conferences around the country,
as well as the many local fundraising events
involving our residents and staff

Expansion across the Tasman
Taking the Summerset business into Australia has
been an active consideration for us over the last
year and we are now in the process of identifying
potential sites for acquisition. We completed
a restructure of our banking facilities in 2018,
introducing the Commonwealth Bank of Australia
to the banking syndicate (also comprising
ANZ and BNZ), and subsequently have the ability
to borrow funds in Australian dollars to fund
our expansion.
Property prices in the Melbourne residential
market are softening and have fallen 8%-9% over
the 2018 calendar year. A number of factors
appear to be at play, including reduced foreign
buyer demand, tightening credit conditions,
and fewer investors buying property. However,
underlying demand for retirement village

and aged care is not property market-related
and continues to grow. Nevertheless we are
proceeding cautiously given the property market
changes and will apply appropriate safety buffers
when considering the financial returns of any sites
purchased. We believe we are well protected
as any land purchase now would see units being
sold some two to three years from now, by which
time the residential property market should
have stabilised. We also note we expect some
good land-buying opportunities to emerge
in the current market.
Looking ahead
Our business is very well positioned for the
coming years. Although we may be entering a
period of greater uncertainty, we believe
our steady investment in the business will provide
stability. These include continual improvements
in people capability, our employment offer,
systems and processes, enhanced village designs,
and a stronger brand and service offering.
We have leading resident satisfaction results,
top-quartile staff engagement, solid earnings and
cashflow growth, and a strong balance sheet.
We are in a very strong position to not only
continue our growth but to meet the increasing
demand for the quality lifestyle we offer.
We would like to thank our residents for choosing
to live at Summerset, our staff for their hard
work bringing the best of life to our residents, to
our wider stakeholders for their involvement
in the business and to you, our shareholders, for
your ongoing support.

From humble
beginnings
John wanted to build a retirement village
that would be good enough for his Nana.
In the mid 1990s, Summerset’s founder
John O’Sullivan visited his Nana, who had
moved into a geriatric ward in Waikanae.
“She was in what was basically a dormitory
with only a plastic curtain between beds,”
John remembers. “What room she had was
so pokey you could stretch out your arms
and touch all four walls. And all the facilities
were shared – nothing was hers, nothing
was private. When I investigated the market
I found all aged care was like that.”

Mary Finnerty, John’s Nana, who was the catalyst for Summerset.

John wanted to build a retirement
village that would be good enough
for his Nana.

That was the trigger for John to build an
aged care facility that he deemed good
enough for his Nana.

Twenty-one years later,
Summerset is a listed
company with 25 villages,
9 sites for development,
more than 5,000 residents,
more than 1,400 employees
and many thousands of
shareholders.

Room designed for four people at Jubilee Hospital in Wanganui.
Similar to the room John’s grandmother was in.

Residents can move in with the peace
of mind that Summerset will provide them
with the continuum of care they need.
While we’ve grown a lot bigger, and
are looking to double in size over the next
five years, we still put everything to the
ultimate test – is it good enough for Nana?

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

New sites acquired in 2018
The population of people aged over 75 years in New Zealand is forecast to more than triple in the
next fifty years. This statistic clearly shows why demand for quality retirement living will continue to
grow. Summerset now holds nine sites in its landbank, including the five land purchases made during
the year. We have increased the master planning capability in our development team to manage the
increasing demands of finding, securing and managing the resource consents for new pieces of land.
Pohutukawa Place, New Plymouth
Summerset’s second New Plymouth property
is on an 8.1ha property in Waiwhakaiho.
New Plymouth’s over 75-year old population
is forecast to grow by around 37% over the
next decade.
298 homes
Rest home and hospital level care
Memory care centre

Te Awa, Napier
We bought 9.0ha of land on Eriksen Road, Te
Awa for our fourth Hawke’s Bay village.
Napier City has a current over 75-year old
population of around 5,570 with a forecast
40% increase by 2028. Neighbouring Hastings
District’s over 75-year old population is
also forecast to increase strongly over the
next decade.

Waikanae, Kapiti Coast
Summerset purchased 25.5ha (estimated village
size of 8.0ha) on Park Avenue, Waikanae, for our
second Kapiti retirement village.
Forecasts show Waikanae’s over 75-year old
population will grow by around 22% over the
next decade.
290 homes
Rest home and hospital level care

Milldale, Auckland
We purchased 6.0ha in the planned suburb of
Milldale on the Hibiscus Coast. Once complete,
the subdivision is expected to have 4,500 homes
with a town centre, schools and recreational
facilities.

This year we were pleased
to receive resource consent
for our sites in Richmond in
Tasman, Kenepuru in Wellington,
Avonhead in Christchurch and
Te Awa in Napier.
Our consent application for the
St Johns village in Auckland
was declined by the application
hearing committee. The decision
of the hearing panel for the
application stated that the
site was ideal for a retirement
village but ultimately declined
the application as it stood. We
have appealed this decision
to the Environment Court and
are currently working through
mediation with the affected
parties and Auckland City
Council.

We hope to reach an
agreement with the
various parties and
are keen to build a
high quality village
which fits into its
surroundings well
and is an asset to this
community.
If we cannot reach an
agreement, the Environment
Court will hear our appeal later
this year.
Land use resource consent for

PERFORMANCE

We were the first retirement village operator
in New Zealand to become fully certified
for village accessibility at all of our villages
by Lifemark.

Summerset was a founding
member of the Lifemark
organisation which aims to
ensure houses are built with
accessibility and safety in mind.

Designing to Lifemark standards
This year, we were the first retirement operator
in New Zealand to become fully certified for
village accessibility at all of our villages. This
certification covers the overall village precinct
and access throughout it including communal
grounds and wider facilities. The certification
signals that Summerset’s products and services
meet the needs of any New Zealand occupant,
at any age, stage, and ability – an assurance that
Summerset villages will be right for your stage of
life. This means our villages are easy to navigate
for people with mobility issues. The certification
process has taken two years and included
a robust independent audit and remedial
programme to ensure all our facilities meet the
standards. We plan to have all future villages
certified for village accessibility by Lifemark.

This reflects consistent demand

by the desire for security, care
and community.
Care centres opened
In 2018 we opened our Hobsonville care centre.
This has filled quickly, reflecting the quality
of the facilities and care provided, as well as the
strong demand in the Auckland market.
Refurbishments and upgrades
In 2018 we completed a three-year programme
to upgrade leisure centres in our older villages.
Upgrades to the leisure centres included:
improvements to resident kitchen and bars, activity
spaces, presentation areas, and upgrading audio
visual equipment. As a result all villages can now
have a commercial café operation.

We continue to invest in
upgrading facilities in our
existing villages to maintain
resident experience.
Following this we commenced a cycle of
refurbishments in our older care centres (Levin,
Wanganui, Paraparaumu, Havelock North,
Palmerston North and Trentham). In 2018 we
completed the second year of a four-year
programme of care centre upgrades. We have
refreshed the aesthetics of our older care
centres and aligned them to our modern building
standards. Our sun lounges, dining rooms,
lounges, care rooms and ensuites have been given
new drapes, refreshed art work, paint and new
furniture. We are aiming to have this programme
completed in 2019.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

Emergency infrastructure improvements
In 2018 we completed an 18 month programme
to deploy mobile emergency power back-up to
our regional sites to use in the event of a power
outage. These have already come in handy during
a power outage in Taupo in November. The new
generators keep power flowing to the main
village building during an outage, maintaining

essential services for residents. All generators are
subject to a monthly testing regime and annual
certificates. From here on, all regional main
buildings will have power back-up at hand. For
urban villages, the main buildings and apartment
blocks will have generator access.

Becoming a dementia friendly
organisation
Summerset recognises that
dementia is a significant and
growing health challenge
in New Zealand and around the
world. In August we launched
our dementia strategy, aiming to
make Summerset a place where
people living with dementia can
lead fulfilling and meaningful
lives. As part of our strategy we
signed up to Alzheimers New
Zealand’s Dementia Friendly
Recognition Programme.

We aim to be the
first retirement
village provider
in New Zealand to
be accredited as a
dementia friendly
organisation.
Summerset by the Ranges in
Levin was our first village
to achieve the accreditation.
A lot of what we already do is
dementia friendly, so to achieve
our accreditation, we have
improved two key aspects:
1.

2.

Provided education and
training to every employee,
including corporate office
staff, about dementia.
This especially helps our
people communicate with
people that have dementia
and learn about dementia.
Reducing the stigma for
residents who have
dementia. We have created
support groups within our
villages to help people be
more comfortable talking
about dementia.

Stimulating speakers for
our residents
The Summerset Connect
speaker series was a new
addition to our activity
programme in 2018. Speakers
travelled to each of our villages
and presented on a range
of topics. In 2018 we were
pleased to host:
•

International speaker,
Eva Bennett, on the six
ingredients to cook up a
good life,

•

Gillian Eadie from the
Memory Foundation talking
about brain health, and

•

Sue Dwan for an interactive
session on getting your
affairs in order

The 2018 series concluded with
New Zealand author, entertainer
and broadcaster Peta Mathias
at Summerset at Heritage Park
in Ellerslie. The speaker series
has been a success throughout
our villages. The 2019 series will
feature brand new speakers,
talks on understanding
dementia, and a concert series
from the Dame Malvina Major
Foundation.

Locally sourced, wholesome
food is well received
Food is a very important part
of a resident’s experience
at Summerset. In 2018, we
invested in overhauling the food
service at our villages. The new
food offering is provided by
three regionally-based caterers
and an in-house team at two
sites, and focuses on locally
sourced, wholesome food
prepared onsite. The kitchen
teams are responsible for all the
food for our Divine cafés, the
‘Divine at Home’ meal service
and care centre meals.

We’ve been
delighted to see
satisfaction levels for
food increase from
91% to 93% in the

Resident
records
go digital
All Summerset villages are now using
VCare as their centralised database for
resident records and care residents’ health
information. VCare is a New Zealanddeveloped technology solution specifically
designed for the retirement village and
aged care sector. Summerset introduced
VCare with a pilot programme in September
2017 and rolled it out in two phases.
Summerset is the first to use VCare’s mobile
solution and the first to have caregivers
using iPads. Using VCare means our nurses
and caregivers have up-to-date health
information at their fingertips, and can
record patient notes quickly and easily for
our care residents.
Frailan Datic, a registered nurse from
Summerset by the Ranges in Levin, says,
“At first I was worried about technology
taking over the human touch, but since my
training I have a lot of positive things to say
about VCare.”
Caregivers now use iPads to enter their
notes into the VCare system. Summerset by
the Ranges caregiver Michele Hall says that
moving to iPads has helped a lot.
“You don’t have to try to understand
everyone’s handwriting, everything’s there
at your fingertips and you get notifications,”
she explains.
Staff training on VCare has been running
since August 2017, with more than 1,880
training sessions held between August 2017
and November 2018.

achieve our purpose we need a team of engaged people. This is why we
have invested in attracting and retaining the best employees.
We attract and retain the best employees
Our annual staff survey, conducted by external
provider Aon, showed our staff engagement
score increased by two percentage points from
2017 to 2018. Summerset has been building on
the momentum from 2017 when there was
a 14 percentage point increase. We remain in
the top quartile for employee engagement
amongst the 700 Australian and New Zealand
organisations conducting the Aon surveys. We are
above the industry average engagement rate
of 51%. We also measure our staff response rate,
at 76% we are pleased that the majority of
our staff have responded and are optimistic
their feedback will be heard. The feedback helps
us assess our progress on improving our staff
experience and helps identify key actions for
further improvements.
Aon has been measuring staff engagement
for over 50 years, working with New Zealand
businesses for more than a decade to measure
the engagement of their people and provide a
complete picture of the work experience
and the factors that lead to higher engagement.
In New Zealand Aon also works alongside
other large employers such as Air New Zealand,
Coca-Cola Amatil, Foodstuffs and Auckland

Attracting talent
In November we launched our culture-fit
assessment, an interactive video assessment
to attract and recruit potential employees. The
screen shot below is from the filming that took
place at our Hobsonville village. The purpose
of the assessment is two-fold, to showcase
Summerset’s culture to candidates to help them
determine if Summerset is the right workplace for
them, and to provide managers with insights into
potential candidates’ values.

We know that there are times when our staff may
come into difficult circumstances and require extra
support. From May 2018, Summerset staff were
able to access exceptional leave and hardship loans
to help support them through difficult times.
Staff turnover is a key measure that we track in
the business. The aged care and retirement
sector has traditionally had high staff turnover.
Over the last three years we have seen turnover
drop at Summerset, the result of a number of
factors including improved staff benefits, increased
engagement, better and more visible leadership
throughout the business and the caregiver pay
equity settlement. Our turnover is now lower than
the industry average but we still want to do much
better in this area and will report to shareholders
annually on how we progress.

Each year Summerset staff are invited to share in
the company’s success through the staff share
scheme. Staff that choose to participate in the
scheme receive an allocation of $800 per annum
of Summerset shares at no cost. In 2018 87%
of eligible staff subscribed to the scheme. The
shares are held in trust for three years before they
are transferred into the employee’s name to keep

since set up a small studio in Wellington,
where she focuses on high-end fashion and
bespoke garments.
We were determined that our new uniforms
should feel just right. We tested the
uniforms in our villages, with staff providing
feedback on design, wear and comfort. We
made refinements to the uniform based
on this feedback and in 2018 we launched
a fit-for-purpose uniform that is uniquely
Summerset. Each role has different style
options to give staff choices to suit their
body shape and personal preferences. The
uniforms use a Summerset signature print
featuring motifs of the ti kouka (cabbage
tree) and the harakeke (flax) flower.

“It represents the journey
through life – a fitting
theme for the business.”
– Lucilla Gray
To celebrate the launch, Summerset
showcased the garments at the 2018
New Zealand Fashion Week in a private
show. Staff modelled the uniform on
the catwalk to an audience of 150 guests,
including residents from our villages.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Health and Safety
Summerset’s vision is that all of our staff go home safe from
harm each day.
As our staff numbers grow, our vision of ensuring
staff go home safe each day and our duty
to provide a safe workplace remains critically
important, and we continue to invest in our
processes and procedures to maintain our health
and safety ratings and accreditations.

Each year staff contribute to the
health and safety plan so we can
understand and address the
issues highlighted by our people.

We also want to make our villages a safe place
for our residents, their families, contractors and
communities around us. We continually take
health and safety into consideration, from the
design of the village to its daily operations.

2018’s themes were: leadership, people and
capability, and systems and processes. The themes
inform our initiatives and we are very pleased to
report our 2018 health and safety achievements.

Our health and safety committees are the
champions and role models of our health and
safety culture and we proudly display our health
and safety culture statement at every village,
office, and construction site, to remind us that it
is everyone’s responsibility.

Over the last three years there have been consistent
reductions in our recordable injury frequency
rate and our lost time injury frequency rate. We
calculate these rates using the industry standard of
multiplying the total number recorded in a 12 month
period by 200,000 i.e. 100 employee years and then
divide by the total number of hours worked. The
goal is to continue to see these statistics reduce
and there are a range of initiatives in play to achieve
this. Improvements will be driven by enhancing
our people’s safety culture, knowledge and
communication. Going forward we will also focus
more on the general wellness for our staff.

We already offer free health
insurance, hardship loans and free
flu vaccinations every winter.
We see opportunities to assist in areas such as
mental health, health awareness (i.e. diabetes, diet
and smoking), and bullying and workplace culture.

Health and
safety heroes
at work
A good health and safety culture relies on
people in the organisation championing
and modelling best practice. We recognise
these people each year with a health and
safety hero category at our staff recognition
awards. Recipients are selected for their
deep respect for others, team focus, and
attitude of continuous improvement.
In 2018, our heroes were Christchurch’s
Stephanie Meehan, our Casebrook Village
Manager, and Steve Trenberth, Site Manager
at Wigram and Casebrook villages (both
pictured top left with Aaron Smail, General
Manager Development).
Steve and Stephanie make health and safety
a priority in their busy roles. They operate in
an unusual work environment, where some
parts of the village are occupied while other
areas are under construction.
Stephanie says, “I work closely with the
construction project manager as there is
still a lot of construction at our village
but it is also our residents’ home. It’s a
juggling act but it can be balanced with
good communication.”
Stephanie says that at Summerset
everybody takes responsibility.

“At other organisations,
people are happy to leave
health and safety to the
committees, but our villages
know that everyone must
actively participate – we are
all responsible.”

HEALTH AND SAFETY HEROES AT WORK

Stephanie identified the placement of hot
water urns in the care centre as a risk
for staff and residents. Staff were holding
up large tea pots that could spill and result
in serious burns. This led to a full review by
the national health and safety team into
the design, placement and controls on hot
water urns to reduce the risks.
Steve says he recognises health and safety
takes a lot of understanding.

“We’re all learning on a
daily basis. There is more
communication than there
has ever been, and that’s
a really good thing for this
organisation.”
Steve says, “My advice is always to look
out for the small things. Big hazards
will announce themselves but picking
up the near misses will always result
in fewer injuries.”

OUR COMMUNITY

Our Community
Summerset supports the wider community by sponsoring individuals,
organisations, local clubs and groups with a direct relationship with
our villages.
At a national level, Summerset
announced two significant
partnerships in 2018: Dementia
New Zealand and Bowls
New Zealand.
Summerset teams up with
Bowls New Zealand
Bowls is extremely popular
with our residents, each village
has its own bowling green and
residents hold several bowling
sessions a week, so it was only
natural for Summerset to partner
with Bowls New Zealand.
Through this collaboration we
help bring players together to
enjoy a popular sport with over
500 clubs and 35,000 registered
players in New Zealand. We are
also working with Bowls New
Zealand to achieve their vision
of New Zealand being the best
bowling country in the world.
This year we have supported
Bowls New Zealand in the
following ways:
•

Promoting Bowls3Five,
a faster, modernised
version of the traditional
bowls game, screened on
SKY during October to
November 2018

•

Sponsoring the Bowls
New Zealand annual
awards dinner

•

Sponsoring the purchase
of tablets for each bowls
club throughout
New Zealand to capture
membership details
and visitor data

•

Sponsoring the New
Zealand national bowls
tournament

Giving back to our
communities
Summerset is proud to support
a number of other organisations
across the country, including:

Recognising our people’s
fundraising
Our staff often take the initiative
to do their own fundraising and
we recognised their efforts in
2018 by topping up individual
fundraising efforts with an extra
donation from Summerset.
We’ve been delighted to see
many staff take up this offer,
which is part of our staff
benefits package.
In 2018, we made donations to:
•

Alzheimers Manawatu

•

Cancer Research Trust

Dementia care
More than 60% of the New Zealand adult population have a
personal experience with the disease, yet nearly half the population
cannot name an organisation that supports people with dementia.
Dementia is a significant and
growing health challenge
in our communities and villages,
with more than 170,000
New Zealanders forecast to have
dementia by 2050.

Our aim is to raise awareness of dementia,
de-stigmatise the disease and become the
leading provider of care for people living with
dementia in New Zealand.

•

Programme across Summerset with the aim
of accreditation by 2020. We celebrated
our first village to achieve accreditation in
November at Summerset by the Ranges
in Levin. Corporate staff are also involved,

training in October

•

Sponsoring and presenting at Dementia

Commissioning research into dementia
Summerset is committed to increasing awareness
and reducing the stigma of dementia in
New Zealand. We partnered with Dementia
New Zealand and The New Zealand Dementia
Cooperative to commission Nielsen to survey
1,000 New Zealanders about their awareness and
perceptions of dementia.
The research shows that little is understood about
dementia yet it is deeply feared. More than half
the population have a personal experience with
the degenerative brain disease.

•

More than 60% of New Zealanders
have a current personal experience
with dementia

•

Dementia is second only to cancer
as the disease Kiwis most fear being
diagnosed with

•

Fewer than 20% feel they know a lot or
great deal about dementia

•

50% of respondents say they would like
to learn more about how to better look
after people with dementia and those
caring for them

•

Most Kiwis say they would be fearful of
letting their employers know that they
had been diagnosed with the disease.
This is particularly significant in the
context of our aging population and
later retirement age.

Building
a life with
dementia
Despite being diagnosed with dementia
almost 15 years ago, Hamilton resident
Neil Timmo still lives an independent and
active life: he likes to go to the gym,
potter in the garden and build impressive
remote-control boats from scratch.
However, while Neil says it’s possible
to keep his mind active, it doesn’t come
without its challenges. “I have basic
routines I do, and I put everything in
certain places. I struggle to get up in the
morning because I don’t know who I
am for a moment. But I don’t worry about
it now – I make my porridge, and head
to the gym. The gym is my saviour,” says
Neil, adding that he goes every
day because working out strengthens
his concentration.

“Life doesn’t stop because
you have dementia. I accept
the fact that I have it, and
that there are limitations,
but then I get on and do
what I enjoy.”
Neil started building boats as a result
of his diagnosis, and says he has become
more hands on. “I wanted something
to do. I’d never built anything in my life
– I worked in the native timber industry
but if it couldn’t be done with an axe
or chainsaw, I couldn’t do it,” he says,
laughing.

BUILDING A LIFE WITH DEMENTIA

His son helps him to select model boats to
build, then Neil purchases the materials and
sets to work moulding, shaping, and gluing
the structure, before wiring the electronics.

“I like making things with my
hands. It stimulates me.”
He colours the boats using paint and
an airbrush, and says every boat is different
– and is a replica of a boat still in use today.
Neil is also heavily involved with Dementia
Waikato, and attends regular workshops
and meetings – which his family drives him
to. “Family is a big thing with dementia.
I’m really lucky with mine; they look after
me.” Neil has also helped to start a monthly
club at Summerset down the Lane with
Dementia Waikato and other residents living
with dementia or supporting someone
with the disease. “Accepting dementia is a
big thing. But once I was diagnosed and got
my head around it, I was fine. It’s like having
a broken leg, only it doesn’t mend – but you
learn to do other things. I feel like I’d never
done anything before I got dementia,” says
Neil, adding that his days are now filled with
various activities and projects.

Reducing our
Impact
Environmental responsibility is now fundamental to the success of
any modern business. At Summerset we want to actively manage our
environmental impact and leave a positive legacy for our descendants.
We took the first step on our sustainability
journey by joining CEMARS®, (Certified Emissions
Measurement and Reduction Scheme) in early
2018. We were the first retirement village operator
to be CEMARS certified through a verification
audit by Enviro-Mark Solutions in December 2018.
Our carbon emissions are measured under
three scopes:
•

•

•

•

Scope 1: Direct emissions from
sources that are owned or controlled
by the organisation, for example,
air conditioning systems and petrol
and diesel to fuel our motor vehicles
and lawnmowers
Scope 2: Indirect emissions are
those that occur as a consequence
of the activities of the organisation
but are from sources owned or
controlled by another company, for
example, emissions generated from
purchased electricity
Scope 3: Mandatory emissions
from other indirect emissions due to
the activities of the organisation,
for example, air travel, taxis and waste
to landfill
Scope 3 additional: Additional
emissions from other indirect emissions
such as paper use and residents
electricity

Electricity is widely used throughout our villages
for heating, cooling and lighting. We have included
resident data in our measurements for both
electricity and waste. Including them is important
to us as we are all part of the community and can
all contribute to positive change.
In November 2018, independent auditor
Enviro-Mark Solutions completed the CEMARS
verification audit of our 2017 base year and
we confirmed our targets. As part of the audit
we submitted our reduction plan for the next
five years and this was approved by Enviro-Mark
Solutions.
Our 2018 emissions data has been collected and
was audited by Enviro-Mark Solutions in January
2019. This data was certified in February 2019.
Our construction activities have been excluded
from our measured 2017 base year and 2018
emissions. In 2019 we will begin to measure the
carbon emissions of our construction business
unit and make an action plan to reduce our
emissions in this area.
As Summerset continues to grow and the number
of villages in operation increases, it means we
will continue to increase our absolute carbon
emissions. To measure the effect of our initiatives,
we will measure our reductions on an intensity
basis i.e. carbon emissions per dollar of total
revenue. This is an acceptable reduction basis
under the CEMARS programme.

REDUCING OUR IMPACT

Reducing our carbon
emissions is an important step
toward being socially and
environmentally responsible.

Emissions by intensity (tCO2e/$m of
total revenue)
60.00
50.00
40.00

As we learn more, we will be able to take action
in a number of areas over the coming years.
We will introduce initiatives to reduce the carbon
emissions created by electricity, waste, travel,
paper and fertiliser over the next five years.

From the graph, already in 2018 we have seen
a decrease in our emissions by intensity. As we
introduce initiatives in 2019 we hope to drive
down our emissions by intensity further.
An internal Summerset ‘Green Team’ has been
formed to lead this work and they will be
announcing new initiatives in 2019, as well as
a wider sustainability framework.

Energy – reducing our electricity and gas usage

Waste – minimising our waste to landfill

Travel – being more efficient in the way we travel

Paper – reducing our paper consumption
through paperless systems
Fertilisers – selecting fertilisers with less
greenhouse gases for our village gardens

2 Figure has been extracted from the financial statements

Underlying profit is a non-GAAP measure and differs from NZ IFRS profit for the period. Underlying profit does not have a standardised
meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by other entities.
The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure in addition to IFRS profit to assist readers in determining the realised and
unrealised components of fair value movement of investment property and tax expense in the Group’s income statement. The
measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures to monitor performance and make investment decisions and has
been audited by Ernst & Young. Underlying profit is a measure which the Group uses consistently across reporting periods.
Underlying profit is used to determine the dividend pay-out to shareholders.

Notes to the
Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2018

1. Summary of accounting policies
Reporting entity
The consolidated financial statements presented for the year ended 31 December 2018 are for Summerset Group Holdings Limited
(the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group develops, owns and operates integrated
retirement villages in New Zealand, including independent living, care centres with rest home and hospital-level care and memory
care centres.
Summerset Group Holdings Limited is registered in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and is a FMC Reporting Entity for
the purposes of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The reporting entity is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX),
being the Company’s primary exchange, and is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) as a foreign exempt listing.

Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice in New
Zealand (NZ GAAP), except for Note 2: Non-GAAP underlying profit, which is presented in addition to NZ GAAP compliant information.
NZ GAAP in this instance refers to New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) as appropriate
for profit-oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
These financial statements are expressed in New Zealand dollars, which is the Company’s and New Zealand subsidiaries' functional
currency. The functional currency of the Company's Australian subsidiaries is Australian dollars. All financial information has been
rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.
All amounts are shown exclusive of goods and services tax (GST) except for trade receivables and trade payables, and except where
the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable. When this occurs GST is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as an expense
as applicable.
The measurement basis adopted in the preparation of these financial statements is historical cost with the exception of the items
noted below.
•

Interest rate swaps – Note 14

•

Investment property – Note 11

•

Land and buildings – Note 9

•

Retail bonds – Note 16

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated at the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date
when such control ceases. The financial statements are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, Summerset
Group Holdings Limited, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group transactions and balances arising within the Group
are eliminated in full.
All subsidiary companies are 100% owned and incorporated in New Zealand or Australia with a balance date of 31 December.

Accounting policies
Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to the understanding of the financial statements
are provided throughout the accompanying notes.
The accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the periods presented in these financial statements,
except as outlined below with the adoption of NZ IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers.
The Group adopted all mandatory new and amended NZ IFRS Standards and Interpretations. These new and amended NZ IFRS
Standards and Interpretations had a disclosure impact only on these financial statements.
NZ IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers was effective for the Group from 1 January 2018. There was no material impact
for the Group in relation to accounting or disclosures due to the nature of the Group's transactions. Care fees and village services
are consumed within the same period as they are invoiced and deferred management fee revenue is not impacted as it is covered
currently by NZ IAS 17 - Leases and from 1 January 2019 by NZ IFRS 16 - Leases.
The Group early adopted NZ IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments from 1 July 2017. There was no material impact on transition.
NZ IFRS Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet effective and have not been
adopted by the Group for the annual report period ending 31 December 2018 are outlined below:
NZ IFRS 16 – Leases
This standard will replace NZ IAS 17 – Leases. NZ IFRS 16 - Leases requires a lessee to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease
payments and a ‘right-of-use asset’ for virtually all lease contracts. The Group has completed its evaluation of the impact of adopting
this standard and it is not expected to be significant.
Operating leases will be recognised on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, based on the
discounted value of the operating lease commitments of approximately $12.2 million as at 31 December 2018 as disclosed in note
23. The recognition exemption under NZ IFRS 16 - Leases for short term or low value assets of less than $5,000 USD or leases
terminating within one year will be applied, and these expenses will continue to be recognised on a straight-line basis in the income
statement .
Rental and operating lease expenses previously recognised on a straight-line basis within other expenses will be recognised as
amortisation for right-of-use assets and finance costs for lease liabilities in the income statement. The impact on the income
statement for the year ended 31 December 2019 is expected to be an approximately $0.2 million increase in expenses.
Operating lease payments previously classified as cash flows from operating activities will be reclassified as cash flows from financing
activities for principal repayments of the lease liability. There will be no impact on actual cash payments.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Occupation right agreements confer the right to occupancy of a retirement unit and are considered leases under both NZ IAS 17 Leases and NZ IFRS 16 - Leases. There is no change to the recognition or measurement of occupation right agreements and the
associated deferred management fee revenue. Deferred management fee revenue will continue to be recognised on a straight-line
basis in the income statement over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right
to revenue. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on deferred management fee revenue.
The Group will apply NZ IFRS 16 - Leases from its effective date of 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The
modified retrospective approach under NZ IFRS 16 - Leases means that on transition the Group is not required to restate comparative
information, instead opening equity is adjusted.
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and are not yet effective, that are expected to
have a significant impact on the Group.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The principal areas of judgement in preparing these
financial statements are described in the following notes:
•

Deferred management fees – Note 4

•

Deferred taxation – Note 7

•

Interest rate swaps – Note 14

•

Revenue in advance – Note 4

•

Valuation of investment property – Note 11

•

Valuation of land and buildings – Note 9

•

Valuation of retail bonds – Note 16

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
The Group has also amended the comparative value of investment property. The fair value of investment property is determined
by an independent registered valuer by undertaking a cash flow analysis to derive a net present value. The fair value of investment
property has been amended to adjust for assets and liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position which are also
reflected in the cash flow analysis, as required by NZIAS 40 – Investment Property. This amendment moves the adjustment to assets
and liabilities from being based on the contractual right to deferred management fees to being based on the expected period of
tenure the deferred management fees are earned over. This amendment has been made by adjusting the investment property
balance for revenue received in advance recognised on the balance sheet. Investment property work in progress has also been
amended to adjust for timing differences associated with the recognition of infrastructure costs.
As a result of these amendments there was a requirement to restate the comparative period. There was no impact on underlying
profit as a result of this restatement. No adjustment has been made to periods prior to the comparative period on the basis of
materiality.

Underlying profit
1 Fair value movement of investment property has been restated for 2017. Refer to note 1 comparative information for further details.

Underlying profit is a non-GAAP measure and differs from NZ IFRS profit for the period. Underlying profit does not have a standardised
meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial information presented by other entities.
The Directors have provided an underlying profit measure in addition to IFRS profit to assist readers in determining the realised and
unrealised components of fair value movement of investment property and tax expense in the Group’s income statement. The
measure is used internally in conjunction with other measures to monitor performance and make investment decisions. Underlying
profit is a measure which the Group uses consistently across reporting periods. Underlying profit is used to determine the dividend
pay-out to shareholders.
This statement presented is for the Group, prepared in accordance with the Basis of preparation: underlying profit described below.

Basis of preparation: underlying profit
Underlying profit is determined by taking profit for the period determined under NZ IFRS, adjusted for the impact of the following:
a)

Less fair value movement of investment property: reversal of investment property valuation changes recorded in NZ IFRS
profit for the period, which comprise both realised and non-realised valuation movements. This is reversed and replaced with

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

realised development margin and realised resale gains during the period, effectively removing the unrealised component
of the fair value movement of investment property.
b)

Add/(less) impairment/(reversal of impairment) of land: remove the impact of non-cash care centre valuation changes
recorded in NZ IFRS profit for the period. Care centres are valued at least every three years (last valued as at 31 December
2017), with fair value gains flowing through to the revaluation reserve unless the gain offsets a previous impairment to fair
value that was recorded in NZ IFRS profit for the period. Where there is any impairment of a care centre, or reversal of a
previous impairment that impacts NZ IFRS profit for the period, this is eliminated for the purposes of determining underlying
profit.

c)

Add realised gain on resales: add the realised gains across all resales of occupation rights during the period. The realised gain
for each resale is determined to be the difference between the licence price for the previous occupation right for a retirement
unit and the occupation right resold for that same retirement unit during the period. Realised resale gains are a measure of
the cash generated from increases in selling prices of occupation rights to incoming residents, less cash amounts repaid to
vacated residents for the repayment of the price of their refundable occupation right purchased in an earlier period. Realised
resale gains exclude deferred management fees and refurbishment costs.

d)

Add realised development margin: add realised development margin across all new sales of occupation rights during the
period, with the recognition point being the cash settlement. Realised development margin is the margin earned on the first
time sale of an occupation right following the development of a retirement unit. The margin for each new sale is determined
to be the licence price for the occupation right, less the cost of developing that retirement unit.
Components of the cost of developing retirement units include directly attributable construction costs and a proportionate
share of the following costs:
•

infrastructure costs

•

All costs above include non-recoverable GST.
Development margin excludes the costs of developing common areas within the retirement village (including a share of
the proportionate costs listed above). This is because these areas are assets that support the sale of occupation rights for not
just the new sale, but for all subsequent resales. It also excludes the costs of developing care centres, which are treated as
property, plant and equipment for accounting purposes.
Where costs are apportioned across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering
the nature of the cost.

3. Segment reporting
The Group operates in one industry, being the provision of integrated retirement villages in New Zealand. The services provided
across all of the Group’s villages are similar, as are the type of customer and the regulatory environment. The chief operating decision
makers, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors, review the operating results of the Group as a whole on a regular
basis. On this basis, the Group has one reportable segment, and the Group results are the same as the results of the reportable
segment. All resource allocation decisions across the Group are made to optimise the consolidated Group’s result.
The Group continues to consider expansion into Australia. To date, the expenditure incurred has been immaterial to the Group and
relates primarily to consultancy and employment costs associated with considering the expansion.
The Ministry of Health is a significant customer of the Group, as the Group derives care fee revenue in respect of eligible government
subsidised aged care residents. Fees earned from the Ministry of Health for the year ended 31 December 2018 amounted to
$28.8 million (2017: $25.0 million). No other customers individually contribute a significant proportion of the Group revenue. All
revenue is earned in New Zealand.

4. Revenue
Care fees and villages services income is recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Deferred management fees, which entitle residents to accommodation and the use of the community facilities within the village,
are recognised over the period of service, being the greater of the expected period of tenure or the contractual right to revenue.
The expected periods of tenure, being based on historical Group averages, are estimated to be seven to eight years for villas, five
years for apartments and three years for serviced apartments and memory care apartments. Where the deferred management fees
over the contractual period exceeds the amortisation of the deferred management fee based on estimated tenure, the amount is
recorded as a liability (revenue in advance). At balance date, the majority of the revenue in advance balance is non-current. Deferred
management fees are recognised on a gross basis in the receipts for residents’ loans section of the statement of cash flows.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Interest expense comprises interest payable on borrowings and is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are capitalised for property, plant and equipment (Note 9) and investment property (Note 11) if they are directly
attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities
to prepare the asset commence and expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues
until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Borrowing costs of $9.0 million (2017: $6.4 million) have been capitalised during the period of construction in the current year.
The weighted average capitalisation rate on funds borrowed representing the borrowing costs of the loans used to finance projects
is 4.17% per annum (2017: 4.10% per annum).
The retail bonds are designated in a fair value hedging relationship. Details of fair value hedging are included in note 14.

7. Income tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax, calculated using the tax rate enacted or substantively enacted at balance date
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement except when it
relates to items recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the tax expense is recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred tax expense is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent it is
probable it will be utilised. Temporary differences for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit, unless they arise from business combination, are not provided for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Trade receivables are not significant on an individual
basis and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate, less an
allowance for impairment. The allowance for doubtful debts is made up of expected credit losses based on assessment of trade
receivables debt at the individual level for impairment, plus an additional allowance on the remaining balance for potential credit
losses not yet identified. The expected credit losses allowance requirement on the remaining balance has been set at 2%. There has
been no material change in the allowance for doubtful debts from prior year.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
9. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes care centres, both complete and under development, and corporate assets held.
All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
of the asset. The cost of self-constructed care centres includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary
to bring the care centres to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents,
interest during the build period and head office costs directly related to the construction of the care centres. Where costs are
apportioned across more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, completed care centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of
the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on care centres and accumulated impairment losses, if any, since
the assets were last revalued. Other corporate assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses, if any. Where an item of plant and equipment is disposed of, the gain or loss recognised in the income statement
is calculated as the difference between the net sales price and the carrying amount of the asset.
Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence, which is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged
between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm’s length transaction as at the valuation date.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset
previously recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement unless it directly
offsets a previous surplus in the same asset in other comprehensive income. Any accumulated depreciation at revaluation date is
eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon
disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings. Independent valuations
are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the asset’s fair value at
the balance sheet date.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line (SL) or diminishing value (DV) basis over the estimated useful
life of each item of property, plant and equipment, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. Depreciation methods,
useful lives and residual values are reassessed at the reporting date. Major depreciation rates are as follows:
•
•

Buildings (2% DV or SL)
Motor vehicles (10% to 36% DV or SL)

•
•

Furniture and fittings (2% to 80% DV or SL)
Plant and equipment (2% to 80% DV or SL)

Also included in the buildings category is building fit-out with depreciation rates ranging between 3% to 48% DV or SL.

Carrying amounts

Buildings includes $5.0 million of care centres under development carried at cost at 31 December 2018 (2017: $4.9 million).

Revaluations
An independent valuation to determine the fair value of all completed care centres which are classified as land and buildings was
carried out as at 31 December 2017 by CBRE Limited, an independent registered valuer. Valuations are carried out every three years
unless there are indicators of a significant change in fair value. CBRE determine the fair value of all care centre assets using an
earnings-based multiple approach. Significant assumptions used in the most recent valuation include market value per care bed
of between $68,000 and $173,000 and individual unit earning capitalisation rate of between 12.0% and 15.0%.
As the fair value of land and buildings is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised property, plant
and equipment as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
the entity’s portfolios of land and buildings are the capitalisation rates applied to individual unit earnings and the market value per
care bed. A significant decrease (increase) in the capitalisation rate would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value
measurement and a significant increase (decrease) in the market value per care bed would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair
value measurement.

Intangible assets acquired by the Group are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a diminishing value or straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
intangible assets from the date that they are available for use. The intangible assets are software. The major amortisation rate at
31 December 2018 is 20% straight-line basis.

11. Investment property
Investment property is held to earn current and future rental income (deferred management fees). It comprises land and buildings
and associated equipment and furnishings relating to retirement villages and common facilities in the retirement village. Investment
property includes buildings under development, excluding care centres under development which are included in property, plant
and equipment. Initial recognition of investment property is at cost and it is subsequently measured at fair value with any change
in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The cost of retirement villages includes directly attributable construction costs and other costs necessary to bring the retirement
villages to working condition for their intended use. These other costs include professional fees and consents, interest during the
build period and head office costs directly related to the construction of the retirement villages. Where costs are apportioned across
more than one asset, the apportionment methodology is determined by considering the nature of the cost.
Land acquired with the intention of constructing investment property on it is classified as investment property from the date of
acquisition.
Rental income from investment property, being deferred management fees, is accounted for as described in Note 4.
Depreciation is not charged on investment property.
Note 6 provides details on capitalised borrowing costs.

1 Investment property has been restated for 2017. Refer to note 1 comparative information for further details.

The Group is unable to reliably determine the fair value of non-land retirement villages under development at 31 December 2018
and therefore these are carried at cost. This equates to $167.8million of investment property (2017: $147.4 million).
The fair value of investment property as at 31 December 2018 was determined by CBRE Limited, an independent registered valuer.
The fair value of the Group’s investment property is determined on a semi-annual basis, based on market values, being the estimated
amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of the valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s
length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
To assess the fair value of the Group’s interest in the village, CBRE has undertaken a cash flow analysis to derive a net present value.
There has been no change in valuation technique since the previous period.
As required by NZ IAS 40 - Investment Property, the fair value as determined by the independent registered valuer is adjusted for
assets and liabilities already recognised on the balance sheet which are also reflected in the cash flow analysis.
Significant assumptions used by the valuer include a discount rate of between 13.5% and 16.5% (2017: 13.5% to 16.0%) and a long
term nominal house price inflation rate (growth rate) of between 0% and 3.5% (2017: 0% to 3.5%). Other assumptions used by the
valuer include the average entry age of residents of between 72 years and 90 years (2017: 72 years and 96 years) and the stabilised
departing occupancy periods of retirement units of between 3.7 years and 9.0 years (2017: 3.7 years and 9.1 years).
As the fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are unobservable, the Group has categorised investment
property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Sensitivity analysis to significant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy
To assess the market value of the Group's interest in a retirement village, CBRE has undertaken a cash flow analysis to derive a net

Other key components in determining the fair value of investment property are the average entry age of residents and the average
occupancy of retirement units. A significant decrease (increase) in the occupancy period of retirement units would result in a
significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement and a significant increase (decrease) in the average entry age of residents would
result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

Operating expenses
Direct operating expenses arising from investment property that generated rental income during the period amounted to
$29.3 million (2017: $26.1 million). There were 75 retirement units excluding work in progress (2017: nine) in investment property that
did not generate rental income during the period.

Security
At 31 December 2018, all investment property relating to registered retirement villages under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are
subject to a registered first mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor to secure the Group’s obligations to the occupation right
agreement holders.

14. Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swaps are initially
recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value on each reporting date.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are determined based on cash flows discounted to present value using current market
interest rates.

Cash flow hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its floating rate debt. These interest rate
swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. When interest rate swaps meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective
portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to reserves are transferred out of reserves and included in the
measurement of the hedged transaction when the forecast transaction occurs. When interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria
for cash flow hedge accounting, all movements in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
variable rates and to pay interest at fixed rates. At 31 December 2018, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with
a total notional principal amount of $354 million (2017: $319 million). Of the swaps in place, at 31 December 2018 $267 million (2017:
$219 million) are being used to cover approximately 59% (2017: 63%) of the floating rate debt principal outstanding. These
agreements effectively change the Group’s interest exposure on the principal covered by the interest rate swaps from a floating
rate to fixed rates, which range between 2.78% and 4.43% (2017: 2.78% and 4.47%).
The fair value of these agreements at 31 December 2018 is a $14.1 million liability, comprised of $14.1 million of swap liabilities and
$0.0 million of swap assets (2017: liability of $7.9 million, comprised of $7.9 million of swap liabilities and $0.0 million of swap assets).
Of this, a liability of $360,000 (2017: $333,000) is estimated to be current. The agreements cover notional amounts for terms of
between one and ten years.

Fair value hedges
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk in relation to its fixed rate debt arising from the retail
bonds. The hedge is for the future fair value movements in the retail bonds as a result of market interest rate movements. The Group
has designated all of its $225.0 million retail bonds in fair value hedge relationships.
Both the hedging instrument (interest rate swap) and the hedged risk are recognised at fair value. The change in the fair value of
both items offset in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent the hedging relationship is effective. The increase in fair
value of the interest rate swaps of $3.4 million (2017: $1.2 million) has been recognised in finance costs and has been offset with a
similar fair value loss on the retail bonds to leave an ineffective amount in finance costs of $57,000 (2017: $22,000).
Under the interest rate swap agreements that qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the Group has a right to receive interest at
fixed rates and to pay interest at floating rates. At 31 December 2018, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place with a
total notional principal amount of $225.0 million (2017: $100.0 million). Of the interest rate swaps in place, at 31 December 2018
$225.0 million (2017: $100.0 million) are being used to cover 100% (2017: 100%) of the fixed interest rate retail bonds outstanding.

15. Residents' loans
Residents’ loans are amounts payable under occupation right agreements. An occupation right agreement confers a right of
occupancy to a villa, apartment, serviced apartment or memory care apartment. The consideration received on the grant of an
occupation right agreement is allocated to the resident’s loan in full. These loans are non-interest-bearing and are payable when
both an occupation right agreement is terminated and there has been settlement of a new occupation right agreement for the same
retirement unit and the proceeds from the new settlement have been received by the Group. Residents’ loans are initially recognised
at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group holds a contractual right to set-off the deferred management fee receivable on termination of an agreement against
the resident’s loan to be repaid. Residents’ loans are therefore recognised net of the deferred management fee receivable on the
balance sheet. Deferred management fees are payable by residents in consideration for the supply of accommodation and the right
to share in the use of community facilities. Deferred management fees are paid in arrears with the amount payable calculated as
a percentage of the resident’s loan amount as per the resident’s occupation right agreement. Deferred management fee receivable
is calculated and recorded based on the current tenure of the resident and the contractual right to deferred management fee earned
at balance date. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on recognition of deferred management fee revenue.

16. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings include secured bank loans and unsubordinated fixed rate retail bonds.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent
to initial recognition, the borrowings are measured at amortised cost with any difference between the initial recognised amount and
the redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest rate. The retail
bonds are designated in fair value hedge relationships, which means that any change in market interest rates result in a change in
the fair value adjustment on that debt. Retail bond issue expenses, fees and other costs incurred in arranging retail bond finance
are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant debt instrument.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Security
The banks loans and retail bonds rank equally with the Group’s other unsubordinated obligations and are secured by the following
securities held by a security trustee:
•

a first ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is not a registered retirement village under the Retirement Villages
Act 2003;

•

a second ranking registered mortgage over the land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by
each New Zealand-incorporated guaranteeing Group member that is a registered retirement village under the Retirement
Villages Act 2003 (behind a first ranking registered mortgage in favour of the Statutory Supervisor);

•

a first ranking registered mortgage over all land and permanent buildings owned (or leased under a registered lease) by each
Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group member;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the New Zealand- incorporated guaranteeing Group members, but in respect
of which the Statutory Supervisor has first rights to the proceeds of security enforcement against all assets of the registered
retirement villages to which the security trustee is entitled;

•

a General Security Deed, which secures all assets of the Australian-incorporated guaranteeing Group members; and

•

a Specific Security Deed in respect of each marketable security of Summerset Holdings (Australia) Pty Limited, held by
Summerset Holdings Limied.

17. Financial instruments
Exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. The Board reviews and agrees on
policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.

Categories of financial instruments

Financial assets
All financial assets of the Group are classified at amortised cost except for interest rate swaps which are classified as fair value
through profit and loss and those assets that are designated in a hedge relationship.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities except interest rate swaps and retail bonds are classified as liabilities at amortised cost. Refer to note 16 for
detail on the retail bonds.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a resident or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet their contractual
obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk relates to receivables from residents and bank balances. The Group manages its
exposure to credit risk. The Group’s cash is held with its principal banker, with the level of exposure to credit risk considered minimal
with low levels of cash generally held. Receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and funds are placed with highcredit quality financial institutions. The level of risk associated with sundry debtors is considered minimal due to the recoverability
of this balance being assessed as high. The Group does not require collateral from its debtors and the Directors consider the Group’s
exposure to any concentration of credit risk to be minimal.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The status of trade receivables is as

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is managed by seeking to obtain the most competitive rate of interest at all times. The
Group has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to provide an effective cash flow hedge against the variability in
floating interest rates. The Group has also entered into other interest swap agreements to reduce interest rate repricing risk in relation
to retail bonds. See Note 14 for details of interest rate swap agreements.
To comply with the Group’s risk management policy, the hedge ratio is based on the interest rate swap notional amount to hedge
the same notional amount of bank loans or retail bonds. This results in a hedge ratio of 1:1. This is the same as used for actual risk
management purposes, and such a ratio is appropriate for purposes of hedge accounting as it does not result in an imbalance that
would create hedge ineffectiveness.
In these hedge relationships the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
•

a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship;

•

where the hedge instrument has been transacted on a date different to the rate set date of the bank loan or retail bonds, interest
rates could differ; and

•

differences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.

Other than these sources, due to the alignment of the hedged risk in the hedged item and hedged instrument, hedge ineffectiveness
is not expected to arise.
At 31 December 2018 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’s
profit by $1.3 million (2017: decrease by $0.9 million) and increase total comprehensive income by approximately $8.7 million (2017:
increase by $8.7 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity
by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages liquidity risk on residents’ loans and related
sundry debtors through the contractual requirements of occupation rights agreements, whereby a resident’s loan is only repaid on
receipt of the loan monies from the incoming resident.
The following table sets out the contractual cash flows for all financial liabilities for the Group (including contractual interest
obligations on bank loans):

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Residents’ loans are non-interest bearing and are not required to be repaid following termination of an occupation right agreement
until receipt of cash for the new resident loan from the incoming resident. The figures above have been calculated using best
estimates of resident loan repayments based on historical information. To date, cash for new residents’ loans received has always
exceeded cash to repay residents’ loans, net of deferred management fees.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of the Group's assets, liabilities and financial performance will fluctuate due to changes
in foreign currency rates.
The Group is primarily exposed to currency risk through its subsidiaries in Australia.
The risk to the Group is that the value of the overseas subsidiaries' financial position and financial performance will fluctuate in
economic terms and as recorded in the Group financial statements due to changes in the foreign exchange rates. Due to limited
activity in the Australian subsidiaries in 2018, the Group did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange risk.

Fair values

The fair value of residents’ loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Future cash flows are based on the assumption
that the average tenure periods are those disclosed above and have been discounted at 14% (2017: 14%). The fair value of
residents’ loans is categorised as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of retail bonds is based on the price traded at on the NZX market as at 31 December 2018. The fair value of the retail
bonds is categorised as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined using inputs from third parties that are observable, either directly (i.e. as prices)
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Based on this, the Company and Group has categorised these financial instruments as Level
2 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with NZ IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement.

Capital management
The Group’s capital includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings. The objective of the Group’s capital management is to
ensure a strong credit position to support business growth and maximise shareholder value. The Group is subject to capital
requirements imposed by the bank lenders (through covenants in the Syndicated Facility Agreement) and bond holders (through
covenants in the Master Trust Deed). The Group has met all of these externally imposed capital requirements for the year ended
31 December 2018 (2017: all requirements met). The Group capital structure is managed, and adjustments are made, with Board
approval. There were no changes to objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: none).

The performance hurdles for the vesting of share options to Executive Leadership Team members are based on:
•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget)

•

25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group)

•

10% employee initiatives

•

10% customer initiatives

•

5% clinical strategy initiatives

While there is a requirement to remain employed by Summerset up to vesting date, there are no performance hurdles for vesting
of share options to senior management team members, other than the members of the Executive Leadership Team whose
performance hurdles are described above.
There are no share options exercisable as at 31 December 2018. (2017: nil).
The share option scheme is an equity-settled scheme and measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate
that the share options that will vest. These share options were valued using the Black Scholes valuation model and the share option
cost will be recognised over the vesting period starting on 1 January 2019. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to
repurchase or settle the share options in cash.

Senior employee share plan - share and loan scheme
Up to and including 2017, the Group operated employee share plans for selected senior employees (“Participants”) to purchase
shares in the Company (the "2013 share plan"). The shares for the plans are held by a nominee as share options on behalf of
Participants, until such time after the vesting of shares that the nominee is directed by the Participant they wish to exercise the share
option, or the shares are sold or cancelled by the nominee if vesting criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as all other
ordinary shares.
The Group has provided Participants with interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the acquisition of the shares for these plans.
These loans are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited and eliminate on consolidation.
The issue price of shares under the 2013 share plan is determined from the volume weighted average price on the NZX during
the ten trading days prior to issue.

The share plans are equity-settled schemes and are measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at
the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate that
the shares will vest. These options were valued using the Black Scholes valuation model and the option cost for the year ending
31 December 2018 of $480,000 has been recognised in the income statement of the Company and the Group for that period (2017:

108 ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Independent auditor’s report to the Shareholders of Summerset Group
Holdings Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Summerset Group Holdings Limited (“the company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the
Group”) on pages 72 to 107, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2018,
and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes
in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended of the Group, and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the financial statements on pages 72 to 107 present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Group as at 31 December 2018 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting
Standards.
This report is made solely to the company's shareholders, as a body. Our audit has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company's shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (revised) Code of Ethics for Assurance
Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Ernst & Young provided assurance services in relation to the audit of underlying profit disclosures. We have no other relationship
with, or interests in, the Group. Partners and employees of our firm may deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary
course of trading activities of the business of the Group.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of
the audit report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to
respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures,
including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 109

Property Valuation
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Summerset’s retirement villages and care centres have
a combined value of $2.7 billion and together make up
98% of total assets. Management engages an
independent registered valuer, CBRE Limited, to
determine the fair value of these assets.

To address the key audit matter, we:

These valuations require the exercise of judgment on
behalf of the valuer. Key amongst these judgements are:
•

•

•

evaluated Summerset’s internal review of the external
valuation report;

•

assessed the competence, qualifications, independence
and objectivity of the external valuer;

•

involved our real estate valuation specialists to assist us
in analysing and challenging the valuations for a sample
of villages and evaluating the underlying assumptions
across the portfolio of valuations against the market
based evidence available;

•

tested, on a sample basis, village specific information
relating to core data including sales, unsold stock and
occupancy data supplied to the external valuer by
Summerset to the underlying records held by the Group;

•

assessed the significant input assumptions applied by
the valuer for reasonableness compared to previous
periods assumptions, the changing state of the village
sites and other market changes;

•

examined the allocation of costs from work in progress to
completed village units, care centres and other assets;

•

evaluated the Group’s review of work in progress for
impairment indicators

•

reviewed management’s assessment of care centre fair
value movement since prior year; and

•

assessed the adequacy of the related financial statement
disclosures, including the impact of the restatement
referred to in Note 1 of the consolidated financial
statements.

for retirement village assets:
•

discount rate and

•

forecast long-term nominal house price inflation.

for care centres:
•

earnings per care bed and

•

capitalisation rates.

The highly judgemental and subjective nature of the
valuation coupled with the significance to the financial
statements results in this being an area of audit focus.
Retirement village valuations are performed every 6
months and care centres are valued at least once every 3
years. Care centres were last valued in December 2017.
Retirement village and care centre assets are addressed
in Note 11 Investment property and Note 9 Property plant
and equipment to the consolidated financial statements
respectively.

Deferred Management Fee Revenue Recognition
Why significant

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Deferred management fee (DMF) revenue is 33% of
Summerset’s total revenue. Summerset recognises
deferred management fee revenue from residents over
the longer of the expected period of tenure or the
contractual right to revenue in accordance with the terms
of the resident’s occupational right agreement.

In addressing the key audit matter we focused on
understanding the overall calculation methodology and
testing the integrity of inputs and key assumptions to revenue
recognition throughout the period. In doing so, we:

The amount of revenue recognised in each year is subject
to the Group’s judgement of each resident’s expected
tenure in the village as well as the terms of the
occupational right agreement and the type of unit
occupied. A change in the assumed tenure may have a
material impact on revenue recognised in the year.
Deferred management fee revenue and the associated
deferred management fee receivable and revenue in
advance balances are discussed in Note 4 Revenue to
the consolidated financial statements.

•

for a sample of residents, assessed the accuracy of a
sample of the inputs to, and calculation of, the deferred
management fee revenue recognised during 2018;

•

agreed the contractual terms used in the revenue
recognition calculation for a sample of residents to the
occupational right agreement;

•

compared the movements year on year in revenue
recognised by each village based on an expectation
derived from underlying village data; and

•

compared the Group’s assessment of assumed tenure
against actual observed tenure.

110 ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The directors of the company are responsible for the Annual Report, which includes information other than the financial statements
and auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit,
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based upon the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The directors are responsible, on behalf of the entity, for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting
Standards, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing on behalf of the entity the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(New Zealand) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the External Reporting
Board’s website: https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards-for-assurancepractitioners/ auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Governance
Summerset is committed to following best-practice governance structures and principles and to having good
governance of the way in which the Company operates. It also takes account of the Company’s listings on both the
NZX and ASX.
Summerset has adopted the principles below as an appropriate way to demonstrate its commitment to these
fundamental principles and to illustrate the transparency of the Company’s approach to corporate governance for
the benefit of its Shareholders and other stakeholders. These principles are from the NZX Corporate Governance
Code issued in May 2017 ("NZX Code"). Each principle of the NZX Code is provided below with explanation on how
Summerset meets each principle.
As at 31 December 2018, Summerset was in full compliance with the NZX Code.
On 1 January 2019, amended versions of the NZX Listing Rules (attaching an amended version of the NZX Code) ("2019
Listing Rules") took effect with a six month transition period. Issuers have until 1 July 2019 to adopt the 2019 Listing
Rules. As the Company has not yet adopted the 2019 Listing Rules, this Annual Report has been prepared on the basis
of the requirements and principles set out in the NZX Listing Rules dated 1 October 2017 ("NZX Listing Rules") and
NZX Code.
Summerset’s Board and Committee Charters, and a number of the policies and guidelines referred to in this section,
are available to view at https://www.summerset.co.nz/investor-centre/governance-documents/

Principle 1: Code of Ethical Behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these
standards being followed throughout the organisation.”

Ethical standards
The Board maintains high standards of ethical conduct and expects the Company’s employees to act legally and with
integrity in a manner consistent with the policies, guiding principles and values that are in place. These include the
following:
•

Code of Ethics – This guide sets out the basic principles of legal and ethical conduct expected of all employees
and Directors. The Company encourages open and honest communication by staff about any current or potential
problem, complaint, suggestion, concern or question.

•

Securities trading – In accordance with the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, the NZX Listing Rules, and
the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, Directors and employees of the Company are subject to limitations on
their ability to buy or sell Company shares.

•

Diversity and inclusion – This policy outlines the Company’s guiding principles for diversity and inclusion. Refer
to Principle 2 for further details.

•

Code of Conduct – This policy sets out the expected behaviours while in employment with the Company.
Company employees are expected to act honestly, conscientiously, reasonably and in good faith while at all times
having regard to their responsibilities, the interests of Summerset and the welfare of our residents and
employees’ colleagues.

•

Whistle blowing – This policy encourages employees to come forward if they have concerns regarding serious
wrongdoing, and ensures that employees have access to a confidential process in which they can report any
issues in relation to serious wrongdoing without fear of reprisal or victimisation.

•

Conflicts of interest – This policy outlines the standards of integrity, professionalism and confidentiality to which
all employees and Directors of the Company must adhere with respect to their work and behaviour. To maintain
integrity in decision-making, each Director must advise the Board of any potential conflict of interest if such arises.
If a significant conflict of interest exists, the Director concerned will have no involvement in the decision-making
process relating to the matter.

•

Gifts, entertainment and inducements – This policy governs the acceptance and reporting of benefits given to
staff by third parties.

GOVERNANCE

•

Interests Register – In accordance with the Companies Act 1993 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013,
the Company maintains an Interests Register in which all relevant transactions and matters involving the Directors
are recorded.

The Code of Ethics Policy can be found on the Company’s website and internal intranet, and a copy is provided to all
new staff (including contractors).

Principle 2: Board Composition and Performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”

Role of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is elected by Shareholders, and has responsibility for taking appropriate steps to protect and
enhance the value of the assets of the Company in the best interests of its Shareholders. The Board has adopted a
formal Board Charter detailing its authority, responsibilities, membership and operation.
The key responsibilities of the Board include setting the overall direction and strategy of the Company, establishing
appropriate policies and monitoring performance of management. The Board appoints the Chief Executive Officer
and delegates the day-to-day operating of the business to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer
implements policies and strategies set by the Board and is accountable to it. The Board also has responsibility for
ensuring the Company’s financial position is sound, financial statements comply with generally accepted accounting
practice and that the Company adheres to high standards of ethical and corporate behaviour.
A summary of the Board mandate is as follows:
•

At least two, or, if there are eight or more Directors, three or one-third of the total number of Directors should be
Independent as defined in the NZX Listing Rules;

•

The Chair of the Board should be a non-executive Director;

•

The Chair and the Chief Executive Officer should be different people;

•

Directors should possess a broad range of skills, qualifications and experience, and remain current on how best
to perform their duties as Directors;

•

Information of sufficient content, quality and timeliness as the Board considers necessary shall be provided by
management to allow the Board to discharge its duties effectively;

•

The effectiveness and performance of the Board and its individual members should be re-evaluated on an annual
basis.

Directors receive an induction upon appointment to the Board to ensure their full knowledge of the Company and
the industry in which it operates. The Directors are expected to keep themselves abreast of changes and trends in
the business and to keep themselves up to date to ensure they best perform their duties as Directors of the Company.
All Directors have been issued letters setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment.
Delegation of authority
The Board delegates to the Chief Executive Officer responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy and for
managing the Company’s operations. The Chief Executive Officer has Board-approved levels of authority and, in turn,
sub-delegates authority in some cases to direct reports, and has established a formal process for direct reports to
sub-delegate certain authorities as appropriate. This is documented in the Delegated Authority Policy.
Before approving the Company and Groups’ financial statements a management representation letter is obtained
from the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer declaring that,
in their opinion, the financial records of the Company and Group have been properly maintained and the financial
statements comply with the appropriate accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the financial position
and performance of the Company and Group.
Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution and the NZX Listing Rules, one third of the Directors are required to
retire by rotation and may offer themselves for re-election by Shareholders each year at the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting. Procedures for the appointment and removal of Directors are also governed by the Constitution. The
Nomination and Remuneration Committee identifies and nominates candidates to fill Director vacancies for Board

113

114

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

approval. Information about candidates for election or re-election is included in the Notice of Meeting to assist
Shareholders in deciding whether or not to elect or re-elect the candidate.
Board composition
The Company’s Constitution prescribes that the Board shall be comprised of a minimum of three Directors, with at
least two Directors ordinarily resident in New Zealand. The Board currently comprises six non-executive Independent
Directors. In determining whether a Director is Independent, the Board has regard to the NZX Listing Rules.
The Board considers all of the current Directors to be Independent in that they are not executives of the Company

days in advance, except in the case of special meetings for which the time period may be shorter owing to the urgency
of the matter to be considered.
The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings, and in this capacity is accountable directly to the Board, through
the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board.
All Directors have access to the Executive Leadership Team to discuss issues or obtain information on specific areas

GOVERNANCE

Diversity and inclusion
The Company and its Board are committed to a workplace culture that promotes and values diversity and
inclusiveness. This is outlined in the Company’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy which is available on the Company’s
website.
Diversity is defined as the characteristics that make one individual different from another. Diversity encompasses
gender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, physical capability, family responsibilities, education, cultural
background and more.
Inclusion is defined as a sense of belonging, respecting and valuing all individuals, providing fair access to opportunity,
and removing discrimination and other barriers to involvement. The Board recognises that inclusion leads to a better
experience of work for Summerset’s employees, makes teams stronger, leads to greater creativity and performance,
contributes to a more meaningful relationship with residents, their families and stakeholders, and ultimately increases
value to Shareholders.
The Board believes that diversity across the workforce makes Summerset stronger and better able to connect with,
and bring the best of life to, residents on a day-to-day basis. When there is a variety of thinking styles, backgrounds,
experiences, perspectives and abilities, employees are more able to understand residents’ needs and to respond
effectively to them.
The Diversity and Inclusion Policy establishes the following measurable objectives for achieving diversity:
•

Facilitate and promote equal employment opportunities at all levels, and identify and remove any barriers to equal
opportunity;

•

Facilitate and promote a merit-based environment in which all employees have the opportunity to develop and
perform to their full potential;

•

Reward excellence and ensure all employees are treated fairly, evaluated objectively, and have equal access to
opportunities for progression and promotion on the basis of performance.

Each year the Board reviews and assesses performance against these objectives. The Board considers that for the
year ended 31 December 2018, the objectives for achieving diversity have been met.
As at 31 December 2018 (and 31 December 2017 for the prior comparative period), the mix of gender of those employed
by the Company is set out below:

ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Board performance
The Board undertakes an annual self-assessment of its performance, and its processes and procedures.
Executive Leadership Team performance
The Board evaluates annually the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer reviews
the performance of direct reports and reports to the Board on those reviews. The evaluation is based on criteria that
include the performance of the business and the accomplishment of longer-term strategic objectives. It may include
quantitative and qualitative measures. During the most recent financial year, performance evaluations were
conducted in accordance with this process.

Principle 3: Board Committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”

Board committees
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the
Clinical Governance Committee and the Development and Construction Committee. Each committee operates under
a charter approved by the Board, and any recommendations they make are recommendations to the Board. The
charter for each committee is reviewed annually. All Directors are entitled to attend committee meetings.
Audit Committee
While the ultimate responsibility to ensure the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting rests with the Board,
the Company has in place processes to ensure the accurate presentation of its financial position. These include:
•

One of the main purposes of the Audit Committee is to ensure the quality and independence of the external audit
process. The Audit Committee make enquiries of management and the external auditors so that it is satisfied as to

reported back to the Audit Committee and the external auditors are given the opportunity at Audit Committee
meetings to meet with Directors.

currently comprises of James Ogden (Chair), Anne Urlwin, Rob Campbell and Gráinne Troute.
The Audit Committee generally invites the Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer and external auditors to attend meetings. The Committee also meets and
receives regular reports from the external auditors without management present, concerning any matters that arise
in connection with the performance of their role.
Nomination and Remuneration Committee

remuneration policies and practices for the Company and in reviewing Board composition. Specific objectives
include:

Principle 4: Reporting and Disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate
disclosures.”

Making timely and balanced disclosure
The Company is committed to promoting Shareholder confidence through open, timely and accurate market
communication. The Company has in place procedures designed to ensure compliance with its disclosure obligations
under the NZX and ASX Listing Rules. The Company’s Market Disclosure and Communications Policy sets out the
responsibilities of the Board and management in disclosure and communication, and procedures for managing this
obligation.
Copies of key governance documents, including the Code of Ethics, Securities Trading Policy and Guidelines, Board
and Committee Charters, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, Director and Executive Remuneration Policy, and Market
Disclosure and Communications Policy are all available on the Company’s website at https://www.summerset.co.nz/
investor-centre/governance-documents/.
Some non-financial disclosures, such as the Company’s approach to health and safety, are included within this Annual
Report. The Company recognises it is in the early stages of reporting on non-financial information, and intends to
increase future disclosure in this area.

Principle 5: Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Remuneration of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team is reviewed by the Board’s Nomination and
Remuneration Committee. Its membership and role are set out under Principle 3 above. The Committee makes
recommendations to the Board on remuneration packages, keeping in mind the requirements of the Board and
Executive Remuneration Policy.
The level of remuneration paid to the Directors and the Executive Leadership Team will be determined by the Board.
However, Directors’ fees must be within the limits approved by the Shareholders of the Company.
Further details on remuneration are provided in the Remuneration section of this Annual Report.

GOVERNANCE

Principle 6: Risk Management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The Board should
regularly verify that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”

Summerset has a Risk Management Policy which encompasses the governance and management of material
business risks. This policy is supplemented by a risk management framework whereby the risks faced are regularly
identified, monitored and managed. Examples of these risks include regulation, property market exposure,
construction and development activity, reputation and industry competition (including new entrants).
Summerset’s senior management are required to regularly identify the major risks affecting the business, record them
in the risk register and develop structures, practices and processes to manage and monitor these risks.
Summerset engages KPMG to carry out internal audit work on various parts of the Group’s operations and all major
risk and internal control issues are reported on at each Board meeting.
Health and safety is discussed regularly at Board meetings and specific reviews are sought as required. Monthly
reporting is prepared and used to assist in risk management, covering areas such as health and safety incidents, injury
and near miss frequency rates and actions undertaken. Further information on health and safety is covered in the
Health and Safety section of this Annual Report.

Principle 7: Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”

The Board’s relationship with its auditors, both external and internal, is governed by the Audit Committee Charter,
Audit Independence Policy and the Internal Audit Charter. These charters and policies set out the types of
engagements that can be performed by the external and internal auditors.
The external auditor (Ernst & Young) attends the Company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting, and is available to answer
questions from Shareholders in relation to the external audit.
External audit work for the Group was tendered during 2017, with Ernst & Young remaining in this role.
KPMG was appointed in the role of internal auditor of the Company in December 2016, and its role is governed by
the Internal Audit Charter.
The primary objective of internal audit is to increase the strength of the Company’s control environment. This is guided
by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Company. It assists the Company in accomplishing
its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of its
governance, risk management and internal controls.
The scope of the internal audit programme is set by the Audit Committee.

Principle 8: Shareholder Rights and Relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them
to engage with the issuer.”

Respecting the rights of Shareholders
The Company seeks to ensure that its Shareholders understand its activities by communicating effectively with them
and giving them ready access to clear and balanced information about the Company.
To assist with this, the Company’s website is maintained with relevant information, including copies of presentations
and reports. The Company’s key corporate governance policies are also included on the website.
The Company’s major communications with Shareholders during the financial year include its annual and half-year
reports and the Annual Shareholder Meeting. The annual and half-year reports are available in electronic and hardcopy format.

120 ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Communicating with Shareholders

Financial Officer’s and Company Secretary’s contact details for communications from Shareholders. The Company
responds to all Shareholder communications within a reasonable timeframe.
The Company provides options for Shareholders to receive and send communications electronically, to and from
both the Company and its share and bond registrar.

Shareholder voting rights is set out in the Company’s Constitution.

REMUNERATION 123

acting for Summerset. There are some exclusions within the policy. The insurance cover is supplemented by the
provision of Director and Officer indemnities from the Company, but this does not extend to criminal acts.

Executive remuneration
The remuneration of members of the Executive Leadership Team (Chief Executive Officer and direct reports) is
designed to promote a high-performance culture and to align Executive reward to the development and achievement
of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders.
The Board is assisted in delivering its responsibilities and objectives for Executive remuneration by the Nomination
and Remuneration Committee. The role and membership of this Committee is set out in the Statement of Corporate
Governance.
Summerset’s remuneration policy for members of the Executive Leadership Team provides the opportunity for them
to receive, where performance merits, a total remuneration package in the upper quartile for equivalent marketmatched roles. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee reviews the annual performance appraisal outcomes
for all Executive Leadership Team members, including the Chief Executive Officer. The review takes into account
external benchmarking to ensure competitiveness with comparable market peers, along with consideration of an
individual’s performance, skills, expertise and experience.
Total remuneration is made up of three components: fixed remuneration, short-term performance-based cash
remuneration and long-term performance-based equity remuneration.
Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of base salary and benefits. Summerset’s policy is to pay fixed remuneration with
reference to the fixed pay market median.
Short-term incentives
Short-term incentives (STIs) are at-risk payments designed to motivate and reward for performance, typically in that
financial year. The target value of an STI payment is set annually, as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team
member’s fixed remuneration. For 2018, the relevant percentages were 25% to 50%.
A proportion (80% for the Chief Executive Officer, 30% to 60% for other Executive Leadership Team members) of
the STI is related to achievement of annual performance metrics which aim to align executives to a shared set of key
performance indicators (KPIs) based on business priorities for the next 12 months. Target areas for the shared KPIs
for 2018 are outlined below:
Target

Weighting

Financial: underlying EBITDA performance against budget

40%

Occupation right agreement sales results against budget

20%

Retirement unit delivery against budget

20%

Clinical and customer satisfaction

10%

Employee and health and safety initiatives

10%

There are three performance levels within each target area - gate-opener, on-target and maximum performance with 100% of the amount allocated to that target area being payable when the on-target level is achieved. The
maximum performance levels allow employees to be rewarded for performance above target levels. The maximum
amount of an STI payment for an Executive Leadership Team member is 112% of the STI on-target amount for that
Executive Leadership Team member.
The balance of the STI is related to individual performance measures.
In the event that gate-opener underlying EBITDA performance against budget is not achieved, no STI payment will
be made.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentives (LTIs) are at-risk payments through a share plan, designed to align the reward of Executive
Leadership Team members with the enhancement of shareholder value over a multi-year period.

124 ANNUAL REPORT 2018

2018 LTI Plan

An LTI share option plan commenced in November 2018, of which the Executive Leadership Team members are
participants. Under this plan, Executive Leadership Team members are granted share options. These share options
are exercisable in relation to shares in Summerset Group Holdings Limited.
Option grants are made annually, with the value of each grant being set at the date of each grant and determined as
a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team member’s fixed remuneration. For 2018, the relevant percentages
were 15% to 40%. Vesting of the share options is subject to achievement of performance hurdles, which are assessed
over two and three-year periods.
The performance hurdles for the option grant made in 2018 are based on:
•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget);

•

25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group);

•

10% employee and health and safety initiatives;

•

10% customer initiatives;

•

5% clinical strategy initiatives.

Performance hurdles are set by the Board with the objective of aligning Executive reward to the development and
achievement of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders. The Board considers
that the performance hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for Shareholders.
In addition to the LTI share option plan in place for Executive Leadership Team members, Summerset also operates
an un-hurdled LTI share option plan for other senior managers.
A total of 708,635 share options were granted to Executive Leadership Team members in 2018. None of these share
options are currently exercisable. The Executive Leadership Team includes the Chief Executive Officer. The section
below provides further details of share option movements under the LTI Plan for the Chief Executive Officer.
LTI Plan prior to 2018

Prior to 2018, Executive Leadership Team members were able to purchase shares in Summerset Group Holdings
Limited under an LTI share purchase plan. The shares under this plan are held by a nominee on behalf of the Executive
Leadership Team members until such time after the vesting of shares that the nominee is directed by the Executive
Leadership Team member to transfer or sell the shares, or the shares are sold or cancelled by the nominee if vesting
criteria are not met. The shares carry the same rights as all other ordinary shares.
The Group has provided Executive Leadership Team members participating in the LTI share purchase plans with
interest-free limited recourse loans to fund the acquisition of the shares for these plans. These loans must be repaid
in full before shares are transferred to Executives from the nominee.
Grants under this plan were made annually, with performance measured over two and three-year periods. The value
of each grant was set at the date of the grant and determined as a percentage of the Executive Leadership Team
member’s fixed remuneration, ranging from 15% to 40%. Vesting of shares is subject to achievement of performance
hurdles, which are assessed over two and three-year periods.
The performance hurdles for each grant under the LTI plan made between 2013 and 2015 are based on Summerset’s
total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the performance of relevant peers and the NZX 50.
The performance hurdles for the grants made in 2016 and 2017 are based on:
•

50% absolute earnings (cumulative actual underlying net profit after tax for the Group against budget);

•

25% relative earnings (earnings per share growth of the Group compared to a defined peer group);

•

10% employee initiatives;

•

10% customer initiatives;

•

5% clinical strategy initiatives.

Performance hurdles are set by the Board with the objective of aligning Executive reward to the development and
achievement of strategies and business objectives to create sustainable value for Shareholders. The Board considers
that the performance hurdles reflect the drivers of sustainable value for Shareholders.
In addition to the LTI share purchase plan in place for Executive Leadership Team members, Summerset also operated
an un-hurdled LTI share purchase plan for other senior managers.

REMUNERATION 125

A total of 2,529,715 shares are held by Summerset LTI Trustee Limited under the LTI share purchase plan on behalf
