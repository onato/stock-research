                 • ASML intends to declare a total dividend for the year 2022 of €5.80 per ordinary share. An
                   interim dividend of €1.37 per ordinary share will be made payable on February 15, 2023

                 • Recognizing this (third) interim dividend and the two interim dividends of €1.37 per ordinary
                   share paid in 2022, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the General Meeting of €1.69 per
                   ordinary share

                 • In Q4 2022 we purchased around 0.6 million shares for a total amount of around €300 million

1 Net Deferred Revenue: Net delayed revenue recognition into subsequent quarters due to Fast Shipments shipped in the relevant quarter or year

2 Fast Shipment: A fast shipment process skips some of the testing in our factory. Final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer site. This leads to a

 deferral of revenue recognition for those shipments until formal customer acceptance but does provide our customers with earlier access to wafer output capacity
3 Normalized Revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Total Net Sales plus Net Deferred Revenue from Fast Shipments, see US GAAP Consolidated Financial
