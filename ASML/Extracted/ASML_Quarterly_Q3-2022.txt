Investor key messages
 •    Global megatrends in the electronics industry, supported by a highly profitable and fiercely innovative ecosystem, are
      expected to continue to fuel growth across the semiconductor market
 •    Growth in semiconductor end markets and increasing lithography intensity are driving demand for our products and services
 •    We plan to ship a record number of systems in 2022 but supply chain constrains result in delayed starts and drive more fast
      shipments
 •    ASML’s comprehensive product portfolio is aligned with our customers’ roadmaps, delivering cost effective solutions in support
      of all applications from leading edge to mature nodes
 •    Based on different market scenarios as presented during our Investor Day in September 2021, we presented an opportunity to
      reach annual revenue in 2025 between approximately €24 billion and €30 billion, with a gross margin between approximately
      54% and 56%
 •    As presented at our Investor Day in September 2021 we see significant growth opportunities beyond 2025 and we expect our
      systems and Installed Base Management1 could provide an annual revenue growth rate of around 11% for the period 2020-
      20302
 •    ASML and its supply chain partners are actively adding and improving capacity to meet current and future customer demand.
      Based on market developments we are looking at feasibility of further increasing our capacity beyond what we presented
      during our September 2021 Investor Day
 •    In light of the demand and our plans to increase capacity, we expect to revisit our scenarios for 2025 and growth opportunities
      beyond, which we plan to communicate during our Investor Day on 11 November 2022
 •    We are continuously striving to improve our performance on ESG Sustainability KPIs and are upgrading our ESG
      Sustainability strategy to accelerate progress
 •    We expect to continue to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders through a combination of growing dividends
      and share buybacks

 2 A fast shipment process skips some of the testing in our factory. Final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer site. This leads to a deferral of

  revenue recognition for those shipments until formal customer acceptance, but does provide our customers with earlier access to wafer output capacity

1 Normalized Revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Total Net Sales plus Net Deferred Revenue from Fast Shipments, see US GAAP Consolidated Financial

  Statements (as published on www.asml.com)
2 Net Deferred Revenue: Net delayed revenue recognition into subsequent quarters due to Fast Shipments shipped in the relevant quarter

3 Fast Shipment: A fast shipment process skips some of the testing in our factory. Final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer site. This leads to a

 deferral of revenue recognition for those shipments until formal customer acceptance but does provide our customers with earlier access to wafer output capacity
4 Based on expected Total Net Sales for the quarter
