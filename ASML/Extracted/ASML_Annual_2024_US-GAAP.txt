Our holistic approach to lithography (continued)




 Creating value in our customers’
 fabs
 Because lithography is a critical step in the
 chip manufacturing process where the wafer
 is processed die by die – and therefore
 has a greater impact on performance than
 any other – ASML’s technology is pivotal
 in our customers’ semiconductor
 fabrication plants (or ‘fabs’). Our holistic
 approach helps increase lithography
 systems’ availability, reduce overall costs,
 and optimize yield for our customers.

Steps in the microchip manufacturing
process:
 1. Deposition – The first step is typically to deposit
    different materials – such as metals/conductors,
    insulation films and semiconductors – onto a
    silicon wafer.
 2. Photoresist coating – The wafer is then coated
    with a light-sensitive layer called a photoresist.
 3. Lithography – Light is projected onto the wafer
    through a reticle. Optics shrink and focus the
    reticle pattern. This pattern is then printed onto
    the wafer when the resist layer is exposed to light.
 4. Baking, developing and etching – The wafer is
    baked and developed to make the pattern
    permanent, with a pattern of open spaces. Reactive
    gases are used to etch away material from the
    open spaces, leaving a 3D version of the pattern.
 5. Ion implantation – The wafer may be bombarded
    with positive or negative ions to tune the
    semiconductor properties.
 6. Removing photoresist – After the layer is etched or
    ionized, the remainder of the photoresist coating that
    was protecting areas not to be etched is removed.
 The entire microchip manufacturing process – from
 start to tested and packaged device, ready for
 shipment – can take half a year, depending on the
 complexity of the microchip.

 Maximizing the process window
 Our holistic approach to lithography
 integrates a set of products – enabling
 chipmakers to develop, optimize and
 control the semiconductor production
 process.
 Lithography and all other stages in the microchip
 manufacturing process must be closely aligned for an
 optimal result. Within lithography, the process window
 is the collection of acceptable variations of process
 parameters that allow a microchip to be manufactured
 and to operate under desired specifications.

 metrology and inspection, ASML’s holistic lithography
 portfolio enables customers to maximize the

Moore’s Law
Why are we so focused on using the Rayleigh criterion to shrink chip features? In 1965, Intel co-
founder Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) would
double every year for the next decade. In 1975, he revised the prediction to every two years. His
prediction has proved to be true – or, as some argue, a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the years that                                                         k1 is a factor relating to
followed, this exponential growth led to significant increases in computing power and reductions in                                                         optical and process
cost, driving rapid advances in technology and innovation in the semiconductor industry.                                                                    optimizations.

Today, although physical limitations are making it more challenging to shrink transistors further, the
semiconductor industry continues to boost performance using what Moore called ‘circuit and
device cleverness’. Innovative chip designs, new materials, advanced packaging and complex 3D
structures are sustaining the industry’s progress. ASML's lithography products play a crucial role in
the affordable mass production of these advanced designs that are ensuring the continuation of
Moore's Law and enabling future technological innovations.

How we respond
During the year, ASML’s management and Investor
Relations team actively engaged with our investor
community to discuss specific topics relevant to our
equity story. We actively engage with the investor
community via a large number of (ESG-related)
conferences, roadshows and conference calls.
On November 14, 2024 we hosted an Investor Day to
update the financial market on our company's growth
opportunities. We also encourage investors to visit our
Veldhoven (NL) or Wilton (US) facilities in person to
discuss and see our capacity expansion plans, as well
as our technology challenges and opportunities in our
ASML Experience Centers.

recognition of a tax expense in relation to a historic tax
position.

Board of Management remuneration (continued)




If the proposed 2025 Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management is not adopted by the 2025 AGM, the
weighting of performance measures Relative TSR and ROAIC will be adjusted to 30% each, in line with the current
Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management.
Other remuneration
In 2024, members of the Board of Management participated in the pension arrangement for the Board of
Management, based on the ‘excedent’ (supplementary) arrangement for our employees in the Netherlands, a
defined contribution opportunity as defined in Dutch fiscal regulations. It consists of a gross pension element (for
the salary below approximately €138,000 minus the Witteveen threshold1) and a net pension element (for the salary
above approximately €138,000). Details of the incurred expenses relating to the application of the pension
arrangement in 2024 can be found in the table Total Remuneration Board of Management.
Expenses reimbursed by ASML in 2024 included company car costs, representation allowances, social security
costs, health and disability insurance costs and other benefits which reflect local market practice.
1. Dutch pension arrangements have a threshold in the build-up of pension entitlements. This threshold exists because all participants are
   assumed to be entitled to the Dutch state pension (AOW) and therefore do not need an additional pension over the first part of their
   pensionable income. The minimum level in the fiscal legislation for this threshold is related to the AOW allowance and is known as the
   Witteveen threshold. This threshold is calculated as the annual AOW allowance (including holiday allowance) for a married person times 10/7.

1. On April 24, 2024, Peter T.F.M. Wennink and Martin A. van den Brink stepped down from their roles as Presidents of ASML. They are still eligible for the performance shares awarded under the LTI plans for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, which will vest based on the performance criteria
   outlined in their grant letters. Their 2024 LTI plan has been granted on a pro rated in time basis to reflect end of term. Consequently, the remaining associated LTI expenses have been recognized over the remaining service period, from the announcement of their retirement on November 30,
   2023, until their actual retirement on April 24, 2024.
2. The LTI plans that were granted on April 29, 2022 became unconditional after the vesting date on January 1, 2025.

Reasons, criteria and principal conditions for granting shares
ASML has sufficient treasury shares as per December 31, 2024 for the purpose of exercising rights related to performance-based share-based remuneration. For the reasons and criteria for granting the performance shares to each
member of the Board of Management, reference is made to the Summary of 2022 Remuneration Policy Board of Management and to the section Board of Management Remuneration in 2024 – Long-term incentive as included in this
Remuneration Report. The principal conditions applicable to the 2024 performance shares are described below. These apply to each member of the Board of Management.
Instrument                    Performance shares
Grant                         Conditional grant on an annual basis based on maximum achievable opportunity. The number of performance shares to be conditionally awarded is calculated using the volume-weighted average share price during the
                              last quarter of the year preceding the conditional award.
Grant date                    Date on which the performance shares are conditionally granted.
Performance period            Period of three years over which the achievement of the predefined performance targets is measured.
Vesting                       The shares will become unconditional after the end of the performance period, depending on the level of achievement of the predetermined performance targets.
Holding period                The minimum holding period is two years after the vesting date.
                              Upon termination of contract, the transfer restrictions will remain in place during the holding period except in case of decease.
                              In case a tax payment is due by the members of the Board of Management over the retrieved variable income, performance shares may be partially sold at vesting (‘sell to cover’) in accordance with the law and internal
                              regulations.

1. Christophe D. Fouquet was appointed as President and CEO of ASML on April 24, 2024. As he was already a member of the Board of Management (BoM), his total remuneration for 2024 is disclosed by taking into account his tenure as both a regular BoM member and as President and CEO
   of ASML.
2. As announced by ASML on November 30, 2023, Peter T.F.M. Wennink stepped down from his role as President of ASML on April 24, 2024. As a result, the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) expenses for his ongoing LTI plans were accelerated over his remaining service period in 2023 and 2024. For
   comparison purposes, if Mr. Wennink were to remain in service, his normalized LTI expense would amount to €2,575 thousand in 2023, with an internal pay ratio of 42 based on US GAAP and 40 based on EU-IFRS for the same year .

1. Indirectly, we track the effectiveness of our related policies through the processes we have in place to make our machines more (energy) efficient and reduce the energy use per wafer pass. In collaboration with the industry, we aim to have a better understanding of the GHG emissions caused
   by the use of our customers’ products and, where possible, we aim to contribute to reducing the negative environmental impacts related to the use of these products.
2. These impacts and risks are currently not covered by targets. Effectiveness of policies and actions in relation to both risks are tracked by ASML. These risks are covered within ASML's risk universe where specified risks are included related to the dissatisfaction of customers and inability to
   develop and deploy products in a timely manner. Policies and actions are therefore tracked through the ASML ERM framework. No additional qualitative and/or quantitative indicators have been used to monitor progress related to these impacts, risks and opportunities ( IROs).

1. Historic values shown in the visual reflect the current reporting scope and calculation methodology and may deviate from reported values in previous Annual Reports, as those were based on the reporting scopes and calculation methodologies used in the respective years.
2. In 2025, we aim to submit our near-term and long-term targets toward 2030 and 2040 to SBTi for continuation.
3. The description of avoided and reduced emissions, included on the next page, is on ASML’s company level, which differs from the guidance by the GHG Protocol on estimating and reporting avoided emissions, which is on product level.
4. Historic emissions for business travel and employee commuting are too small to be included in the visual.
5. The absolute amount of residual emissions shown in the visual is equivalent to the -97% intensity target based on current Climate Transition Plan modelling assumptions but is not a company target by itself.

Description             A 1.5°C scenario would only occur if society managed swift decarbonization in the coming decades,             A 4°C scenario would occur if society fails to decarbonize, resulting in more pronounced physical risks.

Time horizon            For the 1.5°C scenario, this assessment considers a time horizon until 2030 (medium term). This is in         In our assessment, we consider the climate change effects as projected in 2030 (medium term) and
                        line with ASML’s overall strategy and risk time horizon.                                                      2050 (long term). The 2050 time horizon is included for this scenario since physical risks could pose a

In 2024, we calculated our gender pay gap in accordance with ESRS. This metric is determined as the difference of average gross hourly pay levels between female and male employees, expressed as a percentage of the average gross
hourly pay level of male employees. We arrived at an average hourly pay gap of 10.2%. A comparison to previous pay gap reporting under GRI is not available due to the substantial differences in methodology and underlying data
required in accordance with ESRS. Read more in Sustainability statements – Social – Attractive workplace for all – Additional disclosures
The gender pay gap calculation as described in the additional disclosures for S1-16 Remuneration metrics refers to the ‘unadjusted’ pay gap. This means that while we provided raw statistics around this topic, it does not account for
objective factors for pay differences such as job level, performance, location, job family or tenure. Consequently, we cannot attribute the pay gap with pay equity issues per se.
One main driver of our gender pay gap is the underrepresentation of female employees in higher paying roles (generally more senior positions). There is a higher proportion of men across all levels of the organization (79% men, 21%
women) with the highest proportion in senior management (88% men, 12% women). Roles within senior management typically command higher market salaries and opportunities for larger financial incentives. In contrast, there is a high
proportion of women in lower employee bands.
Companies such as ASML, that operate within the technology industry, have traditionally faced challenges attracting women due to their underrepresentation in the STEM talent pool itself. We therefore continue to invest in the
promotion of STEM subjects in primary and secondary school levels and will continue to do so to help further diversify the talent pool. We have also set targets to increase the representation of female employees overall and in
leadership positions specifically. Read more about our targets and actions set for the inflow of women in all roles and female representation in senior leadership roles in Sustainability statements – Social – Attractive workplace for all – Diversity and inclusion
Additionally, we commit to further evaluate and assess pay and to consider objective factors that can impact an employee’s pay, to ensure that no real pay equity issues are present at ASML. We aim to close any unjustified pay
differences between men and women, adhering to local legislation at a minimum. Specifically, we are committed to ensuring we are ready to comply with the EU Pay Transparency Directive going live in July, 2026 and work is underway
to support our readiness for this.

Responsible value chain: How we’re managing (continued)




Our approach                                          Our environmental and human rights due diligence framework
Our approach is derived from key
international standards, including the OECD
                                                         We manage our impacts across the

Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights. Our environmental and human rights
due diligence framework is based on the six
steps as described in the OECD Due
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business
Conduct, and defines how ASML identifies,
prevents, mitigates and accounts for actual
and potential impacts across its value chain.
We strive to identify, assess and prioritize
the most salient human rights and
environmental risks and impacts across our
value chain, from raw materials extraction to
end of life. A transparent value chain is
essential to identify risks and impacts at the

and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an

Revenue recognition – Identification of distinct performance obligations in certain volume purchase
agreements
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, net system sales was EUR 21,769 million for the
year ended December 31, 2024. Sales of systems are usually entered into with customers under volume purchase
agreements (VPAs). These VPAs contain multiple performance obligations, including for example, delivery of goods,
installation, warranty and training.
We identified the evaluation of the distinct performance obligations identified by the Company in certain VPAs as a
critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company’s identification of
distinct performance obligations in these VPAs.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the
design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the Company’s revenue recognition
process related to the identification of distinct performance obligations included in VPAs. We evaluated the
identification of distinct performance obligations in a selection of VPAs by obtaining and reading the VPA and the
underlying accounting analysis. Specifically, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the Company’s
identification of distinct performance obligations by considering terms, conditions and promises that were unique to
the selected contracts.

accounting estimates and assumptions are appropriate. ASML will continue to monitor the impacts of economic
implications and incorporate them into accounting estimates. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and we
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if the assumptions prove incorrect. To the
extent there are material differences between actual results and these estimates, our future results could be
materially and adversely affected.
We believe that the accounting policies described below require us to make significant judgments and estimates in
the preparation of our Consolidated financial statements. Our most critical accounting estimates relate to revenue
recognition (see Note 2 Revenue from contracts with customers). Although still considered an accounting estimate,
the recoverability of deferred tax assets for capitalized R&D costs is no longer considered a critical accounting
estimate. This is as the majority of our R&D expenses at US level are no longer eligible for capitalization for tax
purposes, resulting now in the related deferred tax asset balance decreasing over time due to amortization.

The consideration paid for our performance obligations is typically fixed. However, most of our volume purchase
agreements with customers contain some component of variable consideration, typically dependent on the final
volume of systems ordered by the customer or the system performance. Variable consideration is estimated at
contract inception for each performance obligation based on communication with the customer to understand their
requirements and roadmap. This is subsequently updated each quarter, using either the expected value method or
the most likely amount method, whichever is determined to best predict the consideration to be collected from the
customer. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price if it is considered probable that a significant
revenue reversal will not occur.

Goodwill mainly results from the acquisitions of Cymer and HMI. The balance as of December 31, 2024, is €4,588.6            Intellectual property                                                                                        3–10 years

We have identified two reporting units: Reporting Unit ASML and Reporting Unit Cymer Light Sources. As of                   Customer relationships                                                                                       8–18 years
December 31, 2024, the goodwill allocated to Reporting Unit ASML amounts to €4,126.3 million (2023: €4,126.3
                                                                                                                            Other                                                                                                        2–10 years
million) and Reporting Unit Cymer Light Sources amounts to €462.3 million (2023: €462.3 million).
Based on our assessment during the annual goodwill impairment test, we believe it is more likely than not that the
fair values of the reporting units exceed their carrying amounts, and therefore goodwill was not impaired as of
December 31, 2024. The accumulated impairment as of December 31, 2024, is nil (2023: nil).

2. For further details, see Note 14 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

We have purchase obligations toward suppliers in the ordinary course of business which mainly relate to goods and
services for our operations and obligations relating to further expansion and upgrade of our facilities. The general
terms and conditions of the agreements relating to the major part of our purchase obligations as of December 31,
2024, contain clauses that enable us to delay or cancel delivery of ordered goods and services up to the dates
specified in the purchase agreements, in line with the timing of future sales. The terms and conditions that we
normally agree with our suppliers give us additional flexibility to adapt our purchase obligations to our requirements
in light of the cyclicality and technological developments inherent in the industry in which we operate.

We conclude our liability for unrecognized tax benefits to be appropriate. Based on the information currently                We are routinely subject to examinations and audits from tax and other authorities in the various jurisdictions in
available, we estimate that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by €0.6 million (excluding interest    which we operate. We believe that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been
and penalties) within the next 12 months, mainly as a result of expiration of statute of limitations.                        provided for, and any adjustments as a result of examinations are not expected to have a material adverse effect.

Appendix – Government regulation

Our business is subject to direct and indirect regulations in each of the countries in which our customers or we do
business, and changes in various types of regulations can affect our business adversely. As our business has
expanded, we have become subject to increasing and increasingly complex regulations. Such regulations include
without limitation environmental regulations, workplace safety regulations, regulations under securities laws and
stock exchange rules, anti-corruption regulations, anti-trust regulations, national security regulations, trade
restrictions, export controls including licensing or authorization requirements, requirements to obtain authorizations
for the use of US technology and for employees producing and developing such technology. The implementation of
new, and changes in enforcement of, such legal requirements, including export controls and required permits and
licenses or changes in interpretation, implementation or enforcement of such regulations and requirements, could
impact our products, our manufacturing or distribution processes or location of sales and where and to whom we
can deliver and service our products and services, and could affect the timing of product introductions, the cost of
our production, and products as well as their commercial success in each market in which we operate. The impact
of these regulations and new regulations and enforcement thereof could adversely affect our business, our financial
condition and our results of operations, even where the specific regulations do not directly apply to us or to our
products.

Appendix – Offer and listing details

Our ordinary shares are listed for trading in the form of registered ASML Nasdaq shares and in the form of
registered ASML Euronext Amsterdam shares. The principal trading market of our ordinary shares is Euronext
Amsterdam (trading symbol: ASML). Our ordinary shares also trade on Nasdaq (trading symbol: ASML).
Our shares listed on Nasdaq are registered with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., our New York Transfer Agent,
pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Agent Agreement between ASML and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Our shares
listed on Euronext Amsterdam are held in dematerialized form through the facilities of Euroclear Nederland, the
Dutch centralized securities custody and administration system. The New York Transfer Agent charges shareholders
a fee of up to USD 5.00 per 100 shares for the exchange of our shares listed at Nasdaq for our shares listed at
Euronext Amsterdam and vice versa.
Dividends payable on our shares listed at Nasdaq are declared in euro and converted to US dollars at the rate of
exchange at the close of business on the date determined by the Board of Management. The resulting amounts are
distributed through the New York Transfer Agent and no charge is payable by holders of our shares listed at Nasdaq
in connection with this conversion or distribution.
Pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Agent Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the New York Transfer Agent
for certain out of pocket expenses, including in connection with any mailing of notices, reports or other
communications made generally available by ASML to holders of ordinary shares. The New York Transfer Agent has
waived its fees associated with routine services to ASML associated with our shares listed at Nasdaq. In addition,
the New York Transfer Agent in consideration of its acting as Transfer Agent has agreed to make a contribution
toward covering certain expenses incurred by ASML in connection with the issuance and transfer of our shares
listed on Nasdaq. In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Transfer Agent contributed USD 0.8 million toward
coverage of expenses incurred by ASML (which mainly comprised audit, advisory, legal and listing fees incurred due
to the existence of our share listing on Nasdaq).

Dutch Central Bank. Furthermore, no payments, including dividend payments, may be made to jurisdictions subject
to certain sanctions, adopted by the government of the Netherlands, implementing resolutions of the Security
Council of the United Nations. Cash distributions, if any, on our shares listed at Nasdaq shall be declared in euros
but paid in US dollars, converted at the rate of exchange at the close of business on the date fixed for that purpose
by the Board of Management in accordance with the Articles of Association.

Appendix – Documents on display

We are subject to certain reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As a ‘foreign private issuer’, we are exempt
from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy
solicitations, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and ‘short-swing’
profit recovery provisions contained in section 16 of the Exchange Act, with respect to their purchases and sales of
shares. In addition, we are not required to file reports and Financial statements with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) as frequently or as promptly as companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange
Act that are not foreign private issuers. We are required to file with the SEC, within four months after the end of each
fiscal year, an Annual Report on Form 20-F containing Financial statements audited by an independent accounting
firm and interactive data comprising Financial statements in extensible business reporting language. We publish
unaudited interim financial information in accordance with US GAAP after the end of each quarter. We furnish this
quarterly financial information to the SEC under cover of a Form 6-K.
The documents we file with the SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website, which contains reports and other
information regarding registrants that are required to file electronically with the SEC. The address of this website is

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
ASML’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Rule 13a–15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of
ASML’s CEO and CFO, ASML’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of ASML’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based upon the framework in ‘Internal Control – Integrated
Framework’ (2013) issued by the COSO. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that ASML’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective, as of December 31, 2024, at providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Financial statements for external purposes in
conformity with US GAAP.
KPMG Accountants N.V., an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Financial statements as
included in this Annual Report and has also audited and issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of
ASML’s internal control over financial reporting.

Appendix – Change in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant

At the AGM held on April 26, 2023, PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) was appointed as the new
external audit firm for ASML for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. The appointment of PwC followed after
the completion of a tender and selection process and the subsequent appointment proposal made to the General
Meeting by the Supervisory Board in April 2022, in line with the recommendation by the Audit Committee. The
change in auditors was initiated to comply with relevant independence regulations, that include mandatory audit
firm rotation. Accordingly, KPMG is deemed to have declined to stand for re-election for the purposes of Item
16F(a)(1)(i) of Form 20-F.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the subsequent period through March 5, 2025, (1)
KPMG has not issued any reports on the financial statements of ASML or on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting that contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were the auditors’ reports
of KPMG qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, (2) there has not been any
disagreement over any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedures, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to KPMG’s satisfaction would have caused it to make
reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its auditors’ reports, or any “reportable
event” as described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.
Furthermore, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the subsequent period through March
5, 2025, neither ASML nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with PwC regarding either (i) the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that
might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of ASML, and either a written report or oral
advice that was provided by PwC was considered by ASML as being an important factor in reaching a decision as
to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement as
that term is used in Item 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F or a “reportable event” as described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form
20-F.
ASML has provided KPMG with a copy of the foregoing disclosure and has requested that KPMG furnish ASML with
a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with such disclosure. A copy of the letter, dated March 5,
2025, is filed herewith as Exhibit 15.2.
