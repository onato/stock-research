Investor key messages
 • The semiconductor industry remains strong, driven by artificial intelligence adoption across an
   expanding applications space and is expected to surpass $1 trillion in revenue by 2030
 • The industry will require major innovations to address AI power consumption and cost challenges
 • Our customers remain at the core of our strategy and we believe that lithography will remain at the
   heart of their innovation. We anticipate that an increased number of critical lithography exposures for
   advanced logic and memory processes will be required
 • Our flexible and versatile portfolio is well positioned to address all customer needs as we extend
   holistic lithography to support 3D front-end integration, improve DUV and EUV performance and cost
   effectiveness and scale EUV technology well into the next decade
 • Based on different market and lithography intensity scenarios, as presented during our Investor Day in
   November 2024, we see an opportunity to achieve 2030 annual revenue between approximately €44
   billion and €60 billion with a gross margin between approximately 56% and 60%
 • ASML values the strong industry partnerships which are critical to our success and our collective
   commitment to a leadership position in ESG
 • We expect to continue to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders through growing
   dividends and share buybacks

  Cash return to shareholders
        • ASML intends to declare a total dividend for the year 2024 of €6.40 per ordinary share

        • Recognizing the three interim dividends of €1.52 per ordinary share paid in 2024 and 2025, this
          leads to a final dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting of €1.84 per ordinary share

        • In Q1 2025 we purchased around 4.0 million shares for a total amount of around €2.7 billion
