  "overview": "ASML is a Dutch semiconductor equipment company and the world's sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are critical for manufacturing advanced chips at 7nm and below. The company holds a 100% monopoly in EUV technology, positioning it as an indispensable enabler in the AI revolution and advanced semiconductor production. ASML operates globally with major customers including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.",
  "business_model": {
    "summary": "ASML generates revenue through two primary streams: net system sales (approximately 65% of revenue) including EUV and DUV lithography equipment, and Installed Base Management (approximately 35% of revenue) covering service, upgrades, and field options. The business model features high barriers to entry, customer lock-in through proprietary technology, and recurring service revenue.",
