platform for young generations in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020.

Third Quarter 2020 Highlights:

        Total net revenues reached RMB3,225.7 million (US$475.1 million), a 74% increase from the same period in 2019.
        Average monthly active users (MAUs) reached 197.2 million, and mobile MAUs reached 183.5 million, representing
        increases of 54% and 61%, respectively, from the same period in 2019.
        Average daily active users (DAUs) reached 53.3 million, a 42% increase from the same period in 2019.
        Average monthly paying users (MPUs1) reached 15.0 million, an 89% increase from the same period in 2019.

“We are excited to announce another great quarter with exceptional growth in both user numbers and our top line,” said Mr. Rui Chen, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Bilibili. “Our effective user growth strategy and expanding content library helped us to reach an even broader
audience. In August, our MAUs exceeded 200 million, marking a new monthly record. This milestone is just the beginning. We envision that the
inevitable video-lization trend will lead to great opportunities for Bilibili to grow and expand as the go-to platform for online content in China. As we
leverage our core capabilities in providing engaging content and community experience, we are committed to further improving our brand equity and
capturing this market opportunity. We believe the investments we are making now to increase our stronghold in China’s entertainment market will yield
considerable and sustainable return in the long run.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “Our strong user growth continues fueling our top line expansion. In the third quarter, we achieved
another quarter of record high revenue, which reached RMB3.2 billion, up 74% year-over-year, once again beating the top end of our guidance. As we
rolled out more premium content and services, more traffic was converted to paying users and our overall paying ratio improved. MPUs were 15.0
million in the third quarter, demonstrating an 89% increase year-over-year. We are also glad to have achieved gross margin improvement for the sixth-
consecutive quarter, reaching 23.6%. Looking ahead, we are committed to executing our growth strategy and investing in our future growth, which we
believe will bring long-term value to all of our stakeholders.”

Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB3,225.7 million (US$475.1 million), representing an increase of 74% from the same period of 2019.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1,275.1 million (US$187.8 million), representing an increase of 37% from the same period of
2019. The increase was primarily due to the successful newly launched mobile games.

Value-added services (VAS) (formerly known as Live broadcasting and VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB979.6 million (US$144.3 million),
representing an increase of 116% from the same period of 2019, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts, led by increases
in the number of paying users for the Company’s premium membership program, live broadcasting services and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB557.5 million (US$82.1 million), representing an increase of 126% from the same period of 2019.
This increase was primarily attributable to the increasing number of advertisers, which was driven by further recognition of Bilibili’s brand name in
China’s online advertising market.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB413.4 million (US$60.9 million), representing an increase of 83% from the
same period of 2019, primarily attributable to the increase in sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB2,464.1 million (US$362.9 million), representing an increase of 63% compared to the same period of
2019. Revenue-sharing cost, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB1,179.5 million (US$173.7 million), representing an increase of 77% from
the same period in 2019.

period of 2019.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB1,190.4 million (US$175.3 million), representing a 227% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili’s app and brand, as well
as promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games. The increase was also attributable to the increase in headcount in sales and marketing
personnel.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB253.5 million (US$37.3 million), representing a 55% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the increased headcount in general and administrative personnel, increased share-based
compensation expenses, increased allowance for doubtful accounts, higher rental expenses and other general and administrative expenses.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB401.0 million (US$59.1 million), representing a 62% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel and increased share-based
compensation expenses.

related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions and income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions,
was RMB990.0 million (US$145.8 million), compared to RMB343.1 million in the same period of 2019.

Basic and diluted EPS and adjusted basic and diluted EPS2. Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB3.08 (US$0.45), compared to
RMB1.24 in the same period of 2019. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB2.76 (US$0.41), compared to RMB1.05 in the same
period of 2019.

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents,
time deposits, as well as short-term investments of RMB14.1 billion (US$2.1 billion), compared to RMB8.1 billion as of December 31, 2019.

Recent Development

In August 2020, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with Huanxi Media Group Limited (“Huanxi Media”) (HKEX: 1003) for
346,626,954 newly issued ordinary shares of Huanxi Media for an aggregate consideration of approximately HK$513.0 million (US$66.2 million). Upon
the completion of this transaction, the Company will beneficially own approximately 9.90% of Huanxi Media’s total issued shares.

Simultaneous with the execution of the Subscription Agreement, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company entered into a five-year business
cooperation agreement with a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Huanxi Media, pursuant to which Bilibili and Huanxi Media will pursue
collaboration opportunities in online entertainment for the Chinese market, including films and TV drama series, and developing derivative intellectual
property rights of the films and other TV programs owned by Huanxi Media.

Outlook

For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB3.60 billion and RMB3.70 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to various
uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

1 The paying users are calculated by number of users who paid for games, live broadcasting, premium membership, Bilibili Comic and Maoer, after
eliminating duplicates of users paid for multiple services other than users of Maoer. The Company adds the number of paying users of Maoer toward
its total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

2 Adjusted net loss and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures,
please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions and income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, which are non-cash
charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations,
enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics
used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
