user metrics reached all-time highs in the third quarter. DAUs increased by 9% year over year to 117
million, monthly active users were up 8% to 376 million, and monthly paying users also grew by 17% to
35 million. During the quarter, average daily time spent also reached a record high of 112 minutes, up 6

high-quality content and the distinctive community experience we have cultivated. As we grow with our
users, their engagement increasingly translates into commercial value. We will keep reinforcing this healthy
cycle across our user and commercial ecosystem, where a vibrant community directly fuels business growth
and creates long-term value for all of our stakeholders.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “A year ago, Bilibili turned profitable on a non-
GAAP basis. Building on that milestone, we have continued to grow our businesses and meaningfully
improved our financials throughout 2025. In the third quarter, total revenues grew by 5% year over year to
RMB7.69 billion, with 23% growth in advertising revenues. Gross profit rose by 11% year over year, and
our gross profit margin expanded to 36.7%, marking the 13th quarter of consecutive growth. Through
increased operating leverage and disciplined cost management, our non-GAAP net profit surged by 233%
year over year to RMB786 million in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP net profit margin expanded to 10.2%
in the third quarter, a substantial improvement from 3.2% in the same period of 2024. This continued
momentum reinforces our ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet and positions us to reinvest in
innovation and capture new opportunities in the evolving technology landscape.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted profit/(loss) from operations, adjusted net
profit/(loss), adjusted net profit/(loss) margin, adjusted net profit/(loss) per share and per ADS, basic and
diluted and adjusted net profit/(loss) attributable to the Bilibili Inc.’s shareholders in evaluating its operating
results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-
GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-
based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business
acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on
fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, and loss on repurchase of convertible senior
notes. The Company calculates adjusted net profit/(loss) margin by dividing the adjusted net profit/(loss)
by revenue for the same period. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide
useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the
Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key
metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s
operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a
substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
