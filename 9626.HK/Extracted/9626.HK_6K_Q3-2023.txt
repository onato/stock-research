“Our community growth and commercialization efforts have formed a virtuous cycle in the third quarter,”
said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive officer of Bilibili. “We delivered remarkable user growth
and engagement in the third quarter while effectively improving our commercialization efficiency. Our
DAUs surpassed an exciting milestone of 100 million, marking a 14% year-over-year increase to 103
million. Additionally, users' average daily time spent on our platform reached a historical high of 100
minutes, boosting total user time spent2 by 19% year-over-year. Meanwhile, we are continuing to strengthen
our commercialization efficiency by integrating advertising solutions and live broadcasting across our
content ecosystem. This strategy has driven our revenues from advertising and value-added services up by
21% and 17% year-over-year, respectively. We are proud of the quality community growth we have
achieved thus far, and we are confident that our self-driven content ecosystem will lead to even more user
growth and commercial opportunities ahead.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “In the third quarter, our gross profit margin improved
from 18% to 25%, and our gross profit grew by 38%, both year-over-year. While we grew our DAUs, we
further reined in our total operating expenses by 12% and narrowed our adjusted net loss by 51%, both
year-over-year. Notably, our operating cash flow turned positive in the third quarter, showing our operations
have entered a positive cycle. Going forward, we remain committed to further improving our financials and
creating value for all stakeholders.”

Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB5.8 billion (US$795.7 million), flat with the same period
of 2022.

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB2.6 billion (US$355.7 million), representing
an increase of 17% from the same period of 2022, led by an increase in revenues from live broadcasting
and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1.6 billion (US$224.5 million), representing an increase
of 21% from the same period of 2022, mainly attributable to the Company’s improved advertising product
offerings and enhanced advertising efficiency.
Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB991.8 million (US$135.9 million), representing a
decrease of 33% from the same period of 2022, and an increase of 11% quarter-over-quarter. The year-
over-year decrease was mainly due to the high base from the release of Space Hunter 3 in June 2022, as
well as lower-than-expected revenues from certain new games in the third quarter of 2023.

IP derivatives and others (formerly known as E-commerce and others). Revenues from IP derivatives and
others were RMB580.0 million (US$79.5 million), representing a decrease of 23% from the same period
of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in revenues from IP derivatives sales.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB4.4 billion (US$596.9 million), representing a decrease of 8%
from the same period of 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower content costs, server and bandwidth
costs and others costs led by effective cost control. Revenue-sharing costs, a key component of the cost of
revenues, were RMB2.5 billion (US$336.6 million), representing an increase of 3% from the same period
of 2022.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB1.5 billion (US$198.8 million), representing an increase of 38% from
the same period of 2022, primarily as a result of the Company’s reduction of fixed costs related to platform
operations, as the Company enhanced its monetization efficiency.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses were RMB2.6 billion (US$350.5 million),
representing a decrease of 12% from the same period of 2022.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB992.3 million (US$136.0 million),
representing a 19% decrease year-over-year. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced
promotional spending related to user acquisition in the third quarter of 2023.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB499.1 million
(US$68.4 million), representing an 8% decrease year-over-year. The decrease was primarily attributable to
a decline in allowance for doubtful accounts, rental costs and other general and administrative expenses in
the third quarter of 2023.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB1.1 billion (US$146.1
million), representing a 6% decrease year-over-year. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decline in
staff-related costs in the third quarter of 2023.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB1.1 billion (US$151.8 million), narrowing by 40%
from the same period of 2022.

Adjusted loss from operations1. Adjusted loss from operations was RMB755.4 million (US$103.5million),
narrowing by 51% from the same period of 2022. Adjusted loss from operations is a non-GAAP measure
that excludes share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets
acquired through business acquisitions, expenses related to organizational optimization, and termination
expenses of certain game projects.

Investment income/(loss), net (including impairments). Total investment loss was RMB245.0 million
(US$33.6 million), compared with an investment income of RMB178.6 million in the same period of
2022. The change was primarily attributable to the fair value changes in investments in publicly traded
companies. A fair value loss of RMB137.4 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2023, compared
to a fair value gain of RMB343.0 million for the same period of 2022.
Income tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB18.0 million (US$2.5 million), compared with
RMB27.1 million in the same period of 2022.

Net loss. Net loss was RMB1.3 billion (US$183.3 million), narrowing by 22% from the same period of
2022.

Adjusted net loss1. Adjusted net loss was RMB863.5 million (US$118.3 million), narrowing by 51% from
the same period of 2022. Adjusted net loss is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation
expenses, amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income
tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in
investments in publicly traded companies, gain/loss on the repurchase of convertible senior notes, expenses
related to organizational optimization and termination expenses of certain game projects.

Basic and diluted EPS and adjusted basic and diluted EPS1. Basic and diluted net loss per share were
RMB3.26 (US$0.45) each, compared with RMB4.34 each in the same period of 2022. Adjusted basic and
diluted net loss per share were RMB2.12 (US$0.29) each, compared with RMB4.46 each in the same period
of 2022.

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2023, the
Company had cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments of RMB14.5 billion
(US$2.0 billion).

Repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes

In the third quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of US$14.5 million
(RMB104.0 million) December 2026 Notes with an aggregate cash consideration of US$13.0 million
(RMB93.3 million). As of September 30, 2023, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of April 2026
Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes was US$861.8 million (RMB6.3 billion).

Outlook

For the full year of 2023, due to lower-than-expected mobile game revenues, the Company currently expects
total net revenues to be at the low-end of the RMB22.5 billion to RMB23.5 billion range.

The outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates,
which are all subject to various uncertainties.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted loss from operations, adjusted net loss and
adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its operating results and for
financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based
compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business
acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on
fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain/loss on repurchase of convertible senior
notes, expenses related to organizational optimization, and termination expenses of certain game projects.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the
Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance
and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s
management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when
assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them
in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
