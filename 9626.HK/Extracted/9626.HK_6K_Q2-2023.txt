SHANGHAI, August 17, 2023 -- Bilibili Inc. (“Bilibili” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: BILI and HKEX:
9626), an iconic brand and a leading video community for young generations in China, today announced its
unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.

•   Total net revenues were RMB5.3 billion (US$731.5 million), representing an increase of 8% from the
    same period of 2022.
•   Gross profit was RMB1.2 billion (US$169.3 million), representing an increase of 66% from the same
    period of 2022. Gross profit margin was 23.1%, compared with 15.0% in the same period last year.
•   Net loss was RMB1.5 billion (US$213.5 million), narrowing by 23% from the same period of 2022.
•   Adjusted net loss1 was RMB964.1 million (US$133.0 million), narrowing by 51% from the same period
    of 2022.
•   Average daily active users (DAUs) were 96.5 million, representing an increase of 15% from the same
    period of 2022.
•   2023 full year total net revenues guidance has been updated.

“We accomplished substantial gross profit improvement and notable losses reduction in the second quarter,”
said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive officer of Bilibili. “We continued enhancing our
commercialization efficiency while cultivating a vibrant community. Through the dedicated execution of our
strategies, our advertising revenues increased by 36% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023.
Concurrently, our DAUs grew by 15% year-over-year to 96.5 million. Our users remain deeply engaged, with
an average daily time spent of 94 minutes on Bilibili in the second quarter, increasing our users’ total time spent2
by 22% year-over-year. Looking towards the second half of 2023 and beyond, our priority remains achieving
quality growth in our topline and user community. We are committed to reaching our break-even target while
continuing to host the welcoming and inspiring video community for young generations in China.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “In the second quarter, we achieved greater leverage
through our operational efficiency enhancement. Our gross profit increased significantly by 66% year-over-
year, driving our gross profit margin improved to 23% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, our total operating
expenses and sales and marketing expenses declined by 14% and 22% respectively, both year-over-year. These
approaches effectively led to a 51% year-over-year reduction in our adjusted net loss. Going forward, we will
continue to concentrate on these approaches to grow our gross profit and advance towards profitability.”


Outlook Update

For the full year of 2023, the Company currently expects total net revenues to be between RMB22.5 billion and
RMB23.5 billion. This compares with total net revenues expected between RMB24.0 billion and RMB26.0
billion as previously stated, which reflected the best information available at the time. The revised expectation
is largely due to the delay of certain game launches, as well as lower than expected revenue contribution from
non-core businesses such as IP derivatives and others.

The outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which
are all subject to various uncertainties.
Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB5.3 billion (US$731.5 million), representing an increase of
8% from the same period of 2022.

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB2.3 billion (US$317.4 million), representing an
increase of 9% from the same period of 2022, led by an increase in the average revenues generated from each
paying user for the Company’s value-added services, including live broadcasting and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1.6 billion (US$216.9 million), representing an increase of
36% from the same period of 2022, mainly attributable to the Company’s improved advertising product
offerings and enhanced advertising efficiency.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB890.9 million (US$122.9 million), representing a
decrease of 15% from the same period of 2022, mainly attributable to the lack of new game launches as well as
revenue declines from certain games in the second quarter of 2023.

IP derivatives and others (formerly known as E-commerce and others). Revenues from IP derivatives and others
were RMB538.7 million (US$74.3 million), representing a decrease of 10% from the same period of 2022,
mainly attributable to a decrease in revenue from e-sports copyright sub-licensing.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB4.1 billion (US$562.2 million), representing a decrease of 2%
from the same period of 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower server and bandwidth costs and others
costs. Revenue-sharing costs, a key component of cost of revenues, were RMB2.2 billion (US$309.1 million),
representing an increase of 8% from the same period of 2022. Server and bandwidth costs represented a decrease
of 11% from the same period of 2022.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB1.2 billion (US$169.3 million), representing an increase of 66% from the
same period in 2022, primarily contributed by the Company’s improved operating leverage, as the Company
enhanced its monetization efficiency.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses were RMB2.5 billion (US$345.5 million), representing a
decrease of 14% from the same period of 2022.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB918.2 million (US$126.6 million),
representing a 22% decrease year-over-year. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced promotional
spending related to user acquisition in the second quarter of 2023.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB539.7 million (US$74.4
million), representing a 14% decrease year-over-year. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in
staff related cost in the second quarter of 2023.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB1.0 billion (US$144.4
million), representing a 7% decrease year-over-year.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB1.3 billion (US$176.2 million), narrowing by 42% from
the same period of 2022.

Total other (expenses)/income, net. Total other expenses were RMB246.6 million (US$34.0 million),
compared with total other income of RMB207.5 million in the same period of 2022. The change was primarily
attributable to a loss of RMB186.7 million on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies in
the second quarter of 2023, compared to a gain of RMB305.2 million on fair value change in investments in
publicly traded companies from the same period of 2022.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS,
basic and diluted, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by
excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets
acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business
acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain/loss on repurchase
of convertible senior notes, expenses related to organizational optimization, and termination expenses of certain
game projects. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about
the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and
future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management
in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the
Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or
as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
