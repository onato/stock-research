increasing scale while gaining wider recognition among mass audiences. Video has become more and more integrated in various facets of everyday
life, prompting massive growth in the video-based market. Benefiting from the inevitable trend of videolization, a broad audience of young users and
China’s strong economic growth projections, we are in the right place at the right time to capture the opportunity and increase our leadership in China’s
large video-based market, with a goal of delivering sustainable returns to our partners over the long term.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “Our efforts to achieve scale are reflected clearly in another quarter of strong top line growth as our
MAUs reached 202 million, a remarkable milestone. In addition to active user numbers, our monthly paying users more than doubled to a record 17.9
million in the fourth quarter, representing a paying ratio of 8.9%. Meanwhile, our gross margin reached 24.6%, marking the 7th consecutive quarter of

Notes to Unaudited Financial Information

The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial statements and related notes to be included
in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2020 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been completed, the
Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of December 31, 2020.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could result in significant differences between the
Company’s audited financial statements and this preliminary unaudited financial information.

Outlook

For the first quarter of 2021, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB3.70 billion and RMB3.80 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to various
uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

1 The paying users are calculated by number of users who paid for games, premium membership, live broadcasting, Bilibili Comic and Maoer, after
eliminating duplicates of users paid for multiple services other than users of Maoer. The Company adds the number of paying users of Maoer toward
its total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

2 Adjusted net loss and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures,
please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions and income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, which are non-cash
charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations,
enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics
used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
