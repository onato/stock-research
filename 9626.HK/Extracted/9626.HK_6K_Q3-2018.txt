Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues increased to RMB1,078.8 million (US$157.1 million), representing an increase of 48% from the same period of
2017.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games increased to RMB744.0 million (US$108.3 million), representing an increase of 24% from the same
period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increased number of paying users for mobile games.

Live broadcasting and Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from live broadcasting and VAS increased to RMB169.4 million (US$24.7 million),
representing an increase of 292% from the same period of 2017, mainly attributable to the Company's enhanced monetization efforts, particularly led
by the increasing number of paying users for the live broadcasting services as well as the premium membership program.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising increased to RMB137.3 million (US$20.0 million), representing an increase of 179% from the same period of
2017. This increase was primarily attributable to additional revenue from brand advertising and performance-based advertising that the Company
started to launch from the fourth quarter of 2017.

Other revenues. Other revenues were RMB28.1 million (US$4.1 million), representing a decrease of 20% from the same period of 2017, primarily
attributable to the spinoff of Bilibili's offline events-related business in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by the increase in sales of products
through the Company's e-commerce platform.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 60% to RMB884.2 million (US$128.7 million), compared to RMB553.0 million in the same period of
2017. Revenue-sharing cost, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB445.2 million (US$64.8 million), representing an increase of 68% from

same period of 2017.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB196.8 million (US$28.7 million), representing a 163% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili's app and brand,
including offline events, as well as promotional expenses for the Company's mobile games during the summer holidays and an increase in headcount
in selling and marketing personnel.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB110.6 million (US$16.1 million), representing a 93% increase
year over year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel and increased share-based
compensation expenses.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB146.2 million (US$21.3 million), representing a 96% increase
year over year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel and increased share-based
compensation expenses.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB259.0 million (US$37.7 million), compared to a loss of RMB31.9 million in the same period of
2017.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB11.4 million (US$1.7 million), compared to RMB2.3 million in the same period of 2017.

Net loss. Net loss was RMB246.1 million (US$35.8 million) for the third quarter of 2018, compared to RMB14.6 million in the same period of 2017.

Adjusted net loss.2 Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, was RMB202.7 million (US$29.5 million) compared to RMB2.9 million in the same
period of 2017.

Basic and diluted EPS and Adjusted basic and diluted EPS2. Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB0.88 (US$0.13), compared to
RMB1.20 in the same period of 2017. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB0.72 (US$0.10), compared to RMB1.03 in the same
period of 2017.

Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. As of September 30, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, as well as time deposits of
RMB2.87 billion (US$418.2 million), compared to RMB764.8 million as of December 31, 2017.

Recent Development

On October 3, 2018, the Company and Tencent Holdings Limited ("Tencent") entered into a share purchase agreement. Pursuant to the
agreement, Tencent subscribed for 25,063,451 newly issued Class Z ordinary shares of the Company at a purchase price of US$12.67 per Class Z
ordinary share, which was equivalent to US$12.67 per American Depositary Share ("ADS"). The deal was closed on October 10, 2018, and the
Company received a total consideration of approximately US$317.6 million. Upon the closing, Tencent beneficially owned, considering any existing
holding, approximately 12% of the Company's total issued shares.

Outlook

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB1.04 billion and RMB1.08 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company's preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions,
and customer demand, which are all subject to change.

1 The Company has adopted ASU No. 2014-09, ''Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)", using the modified-retrospective transition
approach beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company's operating results for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2018 and comparable periods.

2 Adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on
non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section of "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" and the table captioned "Unaudited Reconciliations

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted, in
evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company's results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned "Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results" set forth at the end of this press release.
