SHANGHAI, China, May 18, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bilibili Inc. (“Bilibili” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: BILI), a leading online entertainment
platform for young generations in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020.

First Quarter 2020 Highlights:

        Total net revenues reached RMB2,315.5 million (US$327.0 million), a 69% increase from the same period in 2019.

        Average monthly active users (MAUs) reached 172.4 million, and mobile MAUs reached 156.4 million, representing
        increases of 70% and 77%, respectively, from the same period in 2019.

        Average daily active users (DAUs) reached 50.8 million, a 69% increase from the same period in 2019.

        Average monthly paying users (MPUs1) reached 13.4 million, a 134% increase from the same period in 2019.

“We kicked off 2020 with a stellar set of results. Both MAUs and DAUs grew at phenomenal rates while our level of community engagement reached
an all-time high,” said Mr. Rui Chen, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Bilibili. “With our broad and growing content library,
increasing brand equity and unique community experience, Bilibili’s platform has increased its mass-market appeal and become many people’s first
choice for content creation and consumption. In the first quarter, our daily time spent per user soared to a record high level of 87 minutes, while our
monthly active content creators and their content submissions more than doubled compared with the same period last year. Additionally, we continue
to strengthen our market position by expanding our strategic partnerships. In April, we were excited to bring our long-standing partnership with Sony to
the next level with its equity investment and business collaboration plans. Building on our early 2020 momentum, we will continue to cultivate our
library of content, enhance our community bond, and work to improve our monetization capabilities to fuel our user and top-line growth.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “Our strong user metrics have laid a solid foundation for our financial growth. Our MPUs grew
134% to a record 13.4 million, demonstrating our platform’s strong monetization capabilities. Total net revenues once again exceeded our guidance,
reaching RMB2.3 billion, representing a 69% increase year-over-year. As our top line grows, our gross margin continued to expand for the fourth
consecutive quarter reaching 23% in the first quarter of 2020, showing improving operational efficiency. Looking ahead, we will continue to execute on
our growth strategies with a focus on quality.”

First Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB2,315.5 million (US$327.0 million), representing an increase of 69% from the same period of 2019.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1,150.6 million (US$162.5 million), representing an increase of 32% from the same period of
2019. The increase was primarily due to the increasing popularity of both existing and newly launched mobile games.

Value-added services (VAS) (formerly known as Live broadcasting and VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB793.6 million (US$112.1 million),
representing an increase of 172% from the same period of 2019, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts, led by increases
in the number of paying users for the Company’s premium membership program, live broadcasting services and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB214.3 million (US$30.3 million), representing an increase of 90% from the same period of 2019.
This increase was primarily attributable to the increasing number of advertisers, which was driven by further recognition of Bilibili’s brand name in
China’s online advertising market.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB157.1 million (US$22.2 million), representing an increase of 64% from the
same period of 2019, primarily attributable to the increase in sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB1,785.1 million (US$252.1 million), representing an increase of 51% compared to the same period of
2019. Revenue-sharing cost, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB888.8 million (US$125.5 million), representing an increase of 61% from
the same period in 2019.

period of 2019.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB606.0 million (US$85.6 million), representing a 234% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili’s app and brand, as
well as promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games. The increase was also attributable to the increase in headcount in sales and
marketing personnel.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB171.4 million (US$24.2 million), representing a 33% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel and increased share-based
compensation expenses.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB297.3 million (US$42.0 million), representing a 60% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB544.2 million (US$76.9 million), compared to RMB306.7 million in the same period of 2019.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB9.4 million (US$1.3 million), compared to RMB8.2 million in the same period of 2019.

Net loss. Net loss was RMB538.6 million (US$76.1 million), compared to RMB195.6 million in the same period of 2019.

Adjusted net loss2. Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, was RMB474.6 million (US$67.0 million), compared to RMB145.4 million in the
same period of 2019.

period of 2019.

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, time
deposits, as well as short-term investments of RMB7.9 billion (US$1.1 billion), compared to RMB8.1 billion as of December 31, 2019.

Recent Development

On April 9, 2020, the Company and Sony Corporation of America (“SCA”) entered into a share purchase agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, SCA
subscribed for 17,310,696 newly issued Class Z ordinary shares of the Company at a purchase price of US$23.1071 per Class Z ordinary share,
which was equivalent to US$23.1071 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”). The deal was closed on April 9, 2020 and the Company received a total
consideration of approximately US$400 million. Upon the closing, SCA beneficially owned approximately 4.98% of the Company’s total issued and
outstanding shares.

Impact of COVID-19

Among other things, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused delays in the delivery of the merchandise sold on the Company's platform to the customers
during the first quarter of 2020. The delivery has been gradually recovering in the second quarter of 2020. However, if the impact of COVID-19 is
prolonged or worsens further, it may still disrupt the delivery. At the same time, the Company has taken measures to reduce the impact of this
pandemic outbreak, including, upgrading its telecommuting system, monitoring its employees’ health on a daily basis and optimizing its technology
system to support potential growth in user traffic. The extent of the related impact on the Company's financial results and business outlook depends on
the future developments of the global pandemic.

Outlook

For the second quarter of 2020, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB2.50 billion and RMB2.55 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to various
uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

1 The paying users are calculated by number of users who paid for games, live broadcasting, premium membership, Bilibili Comic and Maoer, after
eliminating duplicates of users paid for multiple services other than users of Maoer. The Company adds the number of paying users of Maoer toward
its total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

2 Adjusted net loss and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures,
please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense related to
intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures
provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and
future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational
decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
