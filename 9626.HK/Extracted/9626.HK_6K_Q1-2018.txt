forth at the end of this press release.

First Quarter 2018 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues increased to RMB868.0 million (US$138.4 million), representing an increase of 105% from the same period of
2017.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games increased to RMB688.5 million (US$109.8 million), representing an increase of 97% from the same
period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increasing popularity of mobile games such as Fate/Grand Order and Azur Lane.

Live broadcasting and Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from live broadcasting and VAS increased to RMB95.8 million (US$15.3 million),
representing an increase of 151% from the same period of 2017, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts and promotion of
its VAS services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising increased to RMB70.4 million (US$11.2 million), representing an increase of 144% from the same period of
2017. This increase was contributed by increasing brand advertising as well as newly launched performance-based advertising attracted by the
high-quality traffic of the Company’s platform.

Other revenues. Other revenues increased to RMB13.3 million (US$2.1 million), representing an increase of 65% from the same period of 2017,
primarily attributable to an increase in the sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 80% to RMB654.9 million (US$104.4 million), compared to RMB363.0 million in the same period of
2017. Revenue-sharing cost, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB334.5 million (US$53.3 million), representing an increase of 120% from
the same period in 2017.

Gross profit. Gross profit increased to RMB213.1 million (US$34.0 million), representing an increase of 249% from the same period of 2017.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses increased to RMB287.4 million (US$45.8 million), representing an increase of 107% from the
same period of 2017.

Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB78.9 million (US$12.6 million), representing a 93% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili’s app, as well as the
promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB102.6 million (US$16.4 million), representing a 140% increase
year over year. The increase was primarily due to the share-based compensation expenses with an IPO condition and an increase in professional
service fees.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB105.9 million (US$16.9 million), representing a 92% increase
year over year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB74.3 million (US$11.8 million), compared to RMB77.7 million in the same period of 2017.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB3.2 million (US$0.5 million), compared to RMB1.8 million in the same period of 2017.

Net loss.[3] Net loss was RMB57.8 million (US$9.2 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB67.4 million in the same period of 2017.

[3] The Company has adopted ASU No. 2016-01, ''Financial Instruments," beginning January 1, 2018. The Company anticipates that the adoption of
this new standard might increase the volatility of its investment income, net, as a result of remeasurement of its equity investments. For equity
investments without readily determinable fair value, the Company elected to measure them at cost minus impairment (if any), plus or minus changes
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuers. In the first quarter of 2018,
the Company recorded an investment income of RMB20.6 million (US$3.3 million) as a result.

Adjusted net loss.[2] Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses and amortization
expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, narrowed down by 95% to RMB3.2 million (US$0.5 million) from RMB59.6
million in the same period of 2017.

Basic and diluted EPS and Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS. Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB1.73 (US$0.28), compared to
RMB1.69 in the same period of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB0.94 (US$0.15), compared to RMB1.58 in the same
period of 2017.

Cash Flow and Working Capital

As of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, as well as time deposits of RMB1.1 billion (US$167.9 million), compared to
RMB764.8 million as of December 31, 2017.

Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB471.1 million (US$75.1 million), compared to RMB205.9 million in the same period of 2017.

Recent Developments

On April 2, 2018, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 42,000,000 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each representing
one Class Z ordinary share of the Company, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Company received a total of approximately US$443.3 million of
net proceeds from the IPO, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

Outlook

For the second quarter of 2018, the Company currently expects:

         Net revenues to be between RMB970.0 million and RMB1.0 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions,
and customer demand, which are all subject to change.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share, in
evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
