advertising efficiency.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB519.2 million (US$79.2 million), representing an increase of 230% from

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions and income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, which are non-cash
charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations,
enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics
used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this announcement.
