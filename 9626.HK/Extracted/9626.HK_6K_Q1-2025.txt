users remained highly engaged and demonstrated growing spending power. Average daily time spent per

the increasing value of our users and improved monetization efficiency, our total net revenues for the first
quarter grew 24% year over year to RMB7.0 billion. Building on this strong momentum, we will continue
to unlock the potential of our community by offering more efficient and enhanced commercial solutions.
As the go-to video platform for premium content and a vibrant creative culture, Bilibili is uniquely
positioned to capture emerging opportunities and sustain long-term growth.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “In the first quarter, we accelerated revenue growth
and expanded our margins. This was driven by outstanding performances from our high-margin advertising
and games businesses, which grew by 20% and 76% year over year, respectively. Gross profit increased by
58% year over year, with our gross profit margin rising to 36.3%, up from 28.3% in the same period last
year. Supported by our robust topline and margin gains, we sustained an adjusted net profit of RMB361.5
million. Our virtuous operating cycle continues to drive robust operating cash flow, generating RMB1.30
billion in the quarter. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on profitable growth by scaling our
business and community through efficient, sustainable operations, and delivering long-term value to our
shareholders.”

broadcasting and other value-added services.

increase of 20% from the same period of 2024, mainly attributable to strong revenue growth in
performance-based advertising.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1.73 billion (US$238.6 million), representing an
increase of 76% from the same period of 2024, mainly attributable to the strong performance of the

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted profit/(loss) from operations, adjusted net
profit/(loss), adjusted net profit/(loss) per share and per ADS, basic and diluted and adjusted net profit/(loss)
attributable to the Bilibili Inc.’s shareholders in evaluating its operating results and for financial and
operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses,
amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related
to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in
publicly traded companies, and gain/loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes. The Company believes
that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of
operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial
and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s
operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a
substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
