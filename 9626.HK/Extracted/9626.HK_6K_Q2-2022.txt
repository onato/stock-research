September 8, 2022

SHANGHAI, China, Sept. 08, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bilibili Inc. (“Bilibili” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: BILI and HKEX: 9626), an iconic brand
and a leading video community for young generations in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30,
2022.

Second Quarter 2022 Highlights:

        Total net revenues reached RMB4.9 billion (US$732.9 million), a 9% increase from the same period in 2021.
        Average monthly active users (MAUs1) reached 305.7 million, a 29% increase from the same period in 2021.
        Average daily active users (DAUs1) reached 83.5 million, a 33% increase from the same period in 2021.

        Average monthly paying users (MPUs2) reached 27.5 million, a 32% increase from the same period in 2021.

“Confronting the immense challenges of the macro-environment and COVID-19 lockdowns in the second quarter, we are pleased to have continued to
grow our high-quality user base and control our expenses. We believe the largest impact of the pandemic is behind us, and we are poised to regain
our growth momentum and improve our margins in the second half of 2022,” said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive officer of Bilibili. “Our
ever-growing content in various formats, such as Story Mode, steered our growing user base and increased user engagement in the second quarter.
Particularly, our MAUs reached a record 306 million, up 29% year-over-year, marking another exciting milestone. Our DAUs grew even faster at 33%
year-over-year, driving our DAU/MAU ratio to 27.3%, up from 26.4% in the same period last year. The execution of our monetization initiatives also
supported our ability to convert users to paying users in the second quarter. Simultaneously, we grew our advertising market share, bucking broad
industry trends. Moving through the back half of 2022, we expect to benefit from an improved macro-landscape where we can further grow our
business, while continuing to control costs and close the gap on our net loss.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “Despite the macro headwinds, our net revenues reached RMB4.9 billion in the second quarter, up
9% year-over-year. In particular, our advertising revenues and VAS revenues grew 10% and 29%, respectively, year-over-year, against the backdrop
of a grueling industry climate. More importantly, we increased our user base while implementing rigorous expense control measures that decreased
sales and marketing expenses by 16% year-over-year. Our proposed conversion to primary listing on The Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong Limited is expected to be effective on October 3, 2022. We believe our binary approach will further expand our investor base and provide us with
more flexibility in the capital market.”

Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB4.9 billion (US$732.9 million), representing an increase of 9% from the same period of 2021.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1,046.2 million (US$156.2 million), compared with RMB1,233.2 million in the same period of
2021. The change was mainly due to the lack of popular new exclusively distributed game releases in the first half of 2022.

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB2,103.5 million (US$314.0 million), representing an increase of 29% from the same
period of 2021, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts, led by an increased number of paying users for the Company’s
value-added services including the premium membership program, live broadcasting services and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1,158.3 million (US$172.9 million), representing an increase of 10% from the same period of 2021.
This increase was primarily attributable to further recognition of Bilibili’s brand name in China’s online advertising market, as well as Bilibili’s improved
advertising efficiency.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB601.0 million (US$89.7 million), representing an increase of 4% from the
same period of 2021.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB4,170.6 million (US$622.7 million), representing an increase of 19%, compared with the same period of
2021. The increase was mainly due to higher revenue-sharing costs and content costs. Revenue-sharing costs, a key component of cost of revenues,
was RMB2,068.4 million (US$308.8 million), representing an increase of 18% from the same period in 2021.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB738.3 million (US$110.2 million), compared with RMB989.0 million in the same period of 2021.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses were RMB2,929.3 million (US$437.3 million), representing an increase of 17% from the same
period of 2021.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB1,172.0 million (US$175.0 million), representing a 16% decrease
year-over-year. The decrease was primarily attributable to less promotional spending in the first half of 2022 and was partially offset by an increase in
headcount in sales and marketing personnel.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB625.7 million (US$93.4 million), representing a 44% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel, higher rental expenses and expenses
related to organizational optimization.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB1,131.7 million (US$169.0 million), representing a 68%
increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel, increased share-based
compensation expenses and termination expenses of certain game projects.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB2,191.1 million (US$327.1 million), compared with RMB1,520.6 million in the same period of
2021.

Others, net. Others, net was RMB145.9 million (US$21.8 million), compared with negative RMB34.0 million in the same period of 2021. The change
was primarily attributable to gains of RMB137.0 million from the repurchase of convertible senior notes.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB26.8 million (US$4.0 million), compared with RMB21.7 million in the same period of 2021.

Net loss. Net loss was RMB2,010.4 million (US$300.2 million), compared with RMB1,121.8 million in the same period of 2021.

Adjusted net loss3. Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions,
gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain on the repurchase of convertible senior notes, expenses related to
organizational optimization and termination expenses of certain game projects, was RMB1,967.9 million (US$293.8 million), compared with
RMB1,324.7 million in the same period of 2021.

Basic and diluted EPS and adjusted basic and diluted EPS3. Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB5.08 (US$0.76), compared with
RMB2.91 in the same period of 2021. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB4.98 (US$0.74), compared with RMB3.44 in the same
period of 2021.

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, time
deposits, and short-term investments of RMB24.9 billion (US$3.7 billion).

Share Repurchase Program and Repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes

The Company announced in March 2022 that its board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program, under which the Company may
repurchase up to US$500 million of its ADSs for the next 24 months. During the second quarter of 2022, approximately 1.2 million ADSs were
repurchased under this program for a total cost of US$23.6 million. The Company had repurchased a total of 2.6 million ADSs for a total cost of
US$53.6 million as of June 30, 2022.

In addition, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of US$71.4 million of December 2026 Notes with a total cash consideration of
US$49.8 million in the second quarter of 2022. The Company had repurchased a total principal amount of US$275.4 million December 2026 Notes for
a total cost of US$197.7 million as of June 30, 2022.

The Company’s repurchase programs of its ADSs or convertible senior notes will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions. These
programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Recent Development

The Company applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with regard to its proposed conversion to primary listing (the “Proposed Conversion”) and
received acknowledgement from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on April 29, 2022. The effective date of the Proposed Conversion is expected to be
October 3, 2022 (the “Effective Date”). All necessary shareholders’ approval in respect to the Proposed Conversion had been obtained at the
Company’s annual general meeting held on June 30, 2022. Upon the Effective Date, the Company will become dual primary listed on The Main Board
of Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Hong Kong and the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States, and will continue to make the necessary
arrangements to facilitate compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules as a dual-primary listed issuer on both markets.

Outlook

For the third quarter of 2022, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB5.6 billion and RMB5.8 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to various
uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

1 Starting from the second quarter of 2022, we count our active users as the sum of active users on mobile apps and PC ends during a given period.
We calculate active users on mobile apps based on the number of mobile devices (including smart TV and other smart devices) that have launched
our mobile apps during a given period. Active users on the PC ends refer to the sum of valid logged-in users who visit our PC website at
www.bilibili.com and engage in PC application during a given period, after eliminating duplicates.

2 The paying users refer to users who make payments for various products and services on our platform, including purchases in games and payments
for VAS (excluding purchases on our e-commerce platform). A user who makes payments across different products and services offered on our
platform using the same registered account is counted as one paying user and we add the number of paying users of Maoer toward our total paying
users without eliminating duplicates. Starting from the second quarter of 2022, we add the number of paying users of smart TVs toward our total
paying users without eliminating duplicates.

3 Adjusted net loss and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures,
please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, (gain)/loss on fair value
change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain on repurchase of convertible senior notes, expenses related to organizational optimization
and termination expenses of certain game projects. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about
the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for
greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results.”

Weighted Voting Rights

Bilibili Inc. (the “Company”) is controlled through weighted voting rights. Each Class Y ordinary share entitles the holder to exercise 10 votes and each
Class Z ordinary share entitles the holder to exercise one vote on all matters that require a shareholder’s vote, subject to Rule 8A.24 of the Hong Kong
Listing Rules that requires certain matters to be voted on a one vote per share basis (the “Reserved Matters”). The Company’s weighted voting rights
structure enables Mr. Rui Chen, Ms. Ni Li and Mr. Yi Xu, holders of the Class Y ordinary shares (the “WVR Beneficiaries”), to exercise voting control
over the Company notwithstanding that the WVR Beneficiaries do not hold a majority economic interest in the share capital of the Company. This
allows the Company to benefit from the continued vision and leadership of the WVR Beneficiaries.

Shareholders and prospective investors are advised to be aware of the potential risks of investing in companies with weighted voting rights structures,
in particular that interests of the WVR Beneficiaries may not necessarily always be aligned with those of our shareholders as a whole, and that the
WVR Beneficiaries will be in a position to exert significant influence over the affairs of the Company and the outcome of shareholders’ resolutions,
irrespective of how other shareholders vote. Prospective investors should make the decision to invest in the Company only after due and careful
consideration.

As of June 30, 2022, the WVR Beneficiaries were interested in a total of 83,715,114 Class Y ordinary shares, representing a total of 73.2% voting
rights in the Company with respect to shareholders’ resolutions relating to matters other than the Reserved Matters (excluding the Company’s
repurchase of 2,640,832 Class Z ordinary shares in the form of ADSs held as treasury shares and 6,823,815 Class Z ordinary shares issued and
reserved for future issuance upon the exercise or vesting of awards granted under the Company’s share incentive plans). Class Y ordinary shares may
be converted into Class Z ordinary shares on a one-to-one ratio. Upon the conversion of the Class Y ordinary shares, the Company would redesignate
83,715,114 Class Y ordinary shares and reissue the same number of Class Z ordinary shares, representing 21.4% of the issued share capital of the
Company as at June 30, 2022 (excluding the Company's repurchase of 2,640,832 Class Z ordinary shares in the form of ADSs held as treasury
shares and 6,823,815 Class Z ordinary shares issued and reserved for future issuance upon the exercise or vesting of awards granted under the
Company’s share incentive plans).

As at June 30, 2022, Mr. Rui Chen was interested in and controlled through Vanship Limited 49,299,006 Class Y ordinary shares and held 102,000
Class Z ordinary shares in the form of ADSs, representing a total of 43.1% of the voting rights in the Company. Vanship Limited is controlled by a trust
of which Mr. Chen and his family members are the beneficiaries. As at June 30, 2022, Ms. Ni Li was interested in and controlled through Saber Lily
Limited 7,200,000 Class Y ordinary shares and 908,300 Class Z ordinary shares, representing a total of 6.4% of the voting rights in the Company.
Saber Lily Limited is controlled by a trust, and Ms. Li and her family members are the trust’s beneficiaries. As at June 30, 2022, Mr. Yi Xu was
interested in and controlled through Kami Sama Limited 27,216,108 Class Y ordinary shares and 151,100 Class Z ordinary shares and he held 45,000
Class Z ordinary shares in the form of ADSs directly, representing a total of 23.8% of the voting rights in the Company. Kami Sama Limited is controlled
by a trust, and Mr. Xu and his family members are the trust’s beneficiaries.

The weighted voting rights attached to the Class Y ordinary shares will cease when none of the WVR Beneficiaries have beneficial ownership of any of
the Class Y ordinary shares, in accordance with Rule 8A.22 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules. This may occur:

      (i) upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances set out in Rule 8A.17 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, in particular where a WVR Beneficiary
      is: (1) deceased; (2) no longer a member of our board; (3) deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to be incapacitated for the purpose of
      performing his duties as a director; or (4) deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to no longer meet the requirements of a director set out in
      the Hong Kong Listing Rules;

      (ii) when a WVR Beneficiary have transferred to another person the beneficial ownership of, or economic interest in, all of the Class Y ordinary
      shares or the voting rights attached to them, other than in the circumstances permitted by Rule 8A.18 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules;

      (iii) where a vehicle holding Class Y ordinary shares on behalf of a WVR Beneficiary no longer complies with Rule 8A.18(2) of the Hong Kong
      Listing Rules; or

      (iv) when all of the Class Y ordinary shares have been converted to Class Z ordinary shares.

The Company confirms that it has, since its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and up to June 30, 2022, complied with the Corporate
Governance Code set out in Appendix 14 to the Hong Kong Listing Rules to the extent required by Chapter 8A of the Hong Kong Listing Rules.
