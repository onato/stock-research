Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB2.53 billion (US$350.3 million), representing
an increase of 17% from the same period of 2023, led by an increase in revenues from live broadcasting
and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1.67 billion (US$231.1 million), representing an
increase of 31% from the same period of 2023, mainly attributable to the Company’s improved advertising
product offerings and enhanced advertising efficiency.

decrease of 13% year over year, mainly due to decreased revenues from certain legacy games. The

on June 13, 2024.

IP derivatives and others. Revenues from IP derivatives and others were RMB484.3 million (US$67.1

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB4.06 billion (US$562.2 million), representing an increase of

revenues, were RMB2.24 billion (US$309.9 million), representing an increase of 13% from the same period
of 2023.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB1.61 billion (US$222.3 million), representing an increase of 45% from
the same period of 2023, attributed to the growth in total net revenue and reduced costs related to platform

40% from the same period of 2023.

quarter of 2024.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted loss from operations, adjusted net loss, adjusted
net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted and adjusted net loss attributable to the Bilibili Inc.’s
shareholders in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business
by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through
business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain/loss
on repurchase of convertible senior notes, expenses related to organizational optimization, and termination
expenses of certain game projects. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide
useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the
Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key
metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when
assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them
in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
