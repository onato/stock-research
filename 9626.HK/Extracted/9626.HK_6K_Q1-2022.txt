June 9, 2022

SHANGHAI, China, June 09, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bilibili Inc. (“Bilibili” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: BILI and HKEX: 9626), an iconic brand
and a leading video community for young generations in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31,
2022.

First Quarter 2022 Highlights:

        Total net revenues reached RMB5,054.1 million (US$797.3 million), a 30% increase from the same period in 2021.
        Average monthly active users (MAUs) reached 293.6 million, and mobile MAUs reached 276.4 million, an increase of
        31% and 33% from the same period in 2021, respectively.
        Average daily active users (DAUs) reached 79.4 million, a 32% increase from the same period in 2021.

        Average monthly paying users (MPUs1) reached 27.2 million, a 33% increase from the same period in 2021.

“In the face of the unexpected COVID-19 resurgence and lockdowns, the first quarter presented new challenges impacting businesses nationwide,
particularly in Shanghai, where our headquarters is based. During this period, our priority was to keep our employees safe and maintain normal
business operations while over 8,000 employees worked from home,” said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive officer of Bilibili. “Confronting
the challenges, we delivered solid growth metrics in terms of our MAUs and DAUs, with improved user engagement levels. Daily time spent per user
increased significantly to 95 minutes in the first quarter, setting a new record high. In the meantime, we are determined to advance our
commercialization capabilities, which include growing our paying users and gaining market share in the advertising sector. As we move through the
year, cost control and expense reduction will be paramount to helping us weather the macro headwinds. We look forward to returning to normal
business order as we work together to minimize the impact of the pandemic.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “Our total net revenues in the first quarter were RMB5.1 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Catering to
our users’ needs, we continued to improve our products and services, with our paying ratio reaching a record high of 9.3% in the period. On the other
hand, while selectively investing in R&D that helps us improve our commercialization capabilities, we also progressed our expense control initiatives
resulting in a quarter-over-quarter decrease in sales and marketing expenses. More cost containment efforts will follow in the coming quarters.
Additionally, to increase our equity value and manage our liabilities, we repurchased outstanding ADSs and convertible bonds in the quarter. Looking
ahead, we remain committed to creating value for our shareholders as we work on expanding our top line and narrowing our loss margins.”

uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value
change in investments in publicly traded companies and gain on repurchase of convertible senior notes, which are non-cash charges. The Company
believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall
understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the
Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this announcement.
