             and not PC MAU during a given month. We calculate mobile apps MAU based on the number of mobile devices (including smart TV and
             other smart devices) that launched our mobile apps during a given month. We count mobile MAU of Bilibili Comic, a mobile app offering
             anime and comic content, and Maoer, an audio platform offering audio drama, towards our MAU. We calculate PC MAU by dividing the
             total number of IP addresses used by users to visit our PC website during a given month by an estimate of the average number of IP
             addresses used by each user. “Average MAU” for a period is calculated by dividing the sum of MAU during the specified period by the
             number of months in such period;
      •      “official members” are to users who pass our multiple-choice membership exam consisting of 100 questions, after which additional
             interactive and community features, such as bullet chatting and commenting, will become available to them;
      •      “our platform” are to “Bilibili” mobile apps, PC websites, Smart TV, Bilibili Comic, Maoer and a variety of related features,
             functionalities, tools and services that we provide to users and content creators;
      •      “occupationally generated videos” or “OGV” are to Bilibili-produced or jointly produced content and licensed content procured from third-
             party production companies;
      •      “paying users” on our platform are to users who make payments for various products and services on our platform, including purchases in
             mobile games offered on our platform and payments for VAS (excluding purchases on our e-commerce platform). A user who makes
             payments across different products and services offered on our platform using the same registered account is counted as one paying user
             and we add the number of paying users of Maoer towards our total paying users without eliminating duplicates. “Average monthly paying
             user” for a period is calculated by dividing the sum of monthly paying users during the specified period by the number of months in such
             period;
      •      “professional user generated videos” or “PUGV” are to videos generated by users that exhibits creativity as well as a certain level of
             professional production and editing capabilities;
      •      “retention rate”, as applied to any cohort of users who visit our platform in a given period, are to the percentage of these users who make at
             least one repeat visit after a certain duration; the “12th-month retention rate” for any cohort of users in a given month is the retention rate
             in the twelfth month after the applicable month;
      •      “premium members” are to members who have subscribed to our premium membership, which allows these members to enjoy exclusive or
             advance access to our premium content. We calculate premium members based on the number of members whose premium package is still
             valid by the last day of a given month;
      •      “RMB” and “Renminbi” are to the legal currency of China;

                                                                             2

       •      “shares” or “ordinary shares” are to our Class Y and Class Z ordinary shares, par value US$0.0001 per share;
       •      “US$,” “U.S. dollars,” “$,” and “dollars” are to the legal currency of the United States;
       •      “VAS” are to value-added services, including premium membership, live broadcasting, Bilibili Comic, Maoer and other value-added
              services;
       •      “video-based content” are to, for the purposes of this annual report only, video content on video-centric platforms and non-video-centric
              platforms as well as mobile games. Non-video-centric platforms include social media, instant messaging, e-commerce, browser, and other
              kind of platforms; and
       •      “videolization” are to the trend of video integrating into the scenarios of everyday life,

                Our reporting currency is the Renminbi because our business is mainly conducted in China and a substantial majority of our revenues is
 denominated in Renminbi. This annual report contains translations of Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specific rates solely for the convenience of
 the reader. The conversion of Renminbi into U.S. dollars in this annual report is based on the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the
 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars and from U.S. dollars to
 Renminbi in this annual report were made at a rate of RMB6.3726 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on December 30, 2021 set forth in the H.10 statistical
 release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. We make no representation that any Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have
 been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate, or at all. The PRC government imposes control
 over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into foreign exchange and through restrictions on
 foreign trade.

                                                         FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

               This annual report on Form 20-F contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations and views of future events.
 These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to
 be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the “safe harbor”
 provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995.

               You can identify some of these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,”
 “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “is/are likely to,” “potential,” “continue” or other similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking
 statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of
 operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to:
       •      our goals and strategies;
       •      our future business development, financial conditions and results of operations;
       •      the expected growth of the online entertainment and mobile games industries in China;
       •      our expectations regarding demand for and market acceptance of our products and services;
       •      our expectations regarding our relationships with users, content providers, game developers and publishers, advertisers and other partners;
       •      competition in our industry;
       •      relevant government policies and regulations relating to our industry;
       •      the outcome of any current and future litigation or legal or administrative proceedings; and
       •      other factors described under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors.”

               You should read this annual report and the documents that we refer to in this annual report and have filed as exhibits to this annual report
 completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Other sections of this annual
 report discuss factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New
 risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on
 our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
 forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

                You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements made in this annual
 report relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this annual report. Except as required by law, we undertake
 no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the
 date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

 ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION
 Our Holding Company Structure and Contractual Arrangements with the VIEs
        Bilibili Inc. is not a Chinese operating company but a Cayman Islands holding company with no equity ownership in its VIEs. We conduct our
 operations primarily through our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries in China. PRC laws and regulations prohibit foreign investment in
 internet cultural business (except for music), the internet audio-visual program business, the radio and television program production and operation
 business, and the production of audio-visual products and/or electronic publications. Accordingly, we operate these businesses in China through the
 VIEs, and rely on contractual arrangements among our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their shareholders, as applicable, to control the business
 operations of the VIEs. Revenues contributed by the VIEs accounted for 97.2%, 86.0% and 74.5% of our total revenues for the years of 2019, 2020 and
 2021, respectively. As used in this annual report, “we,” “us,” “our company” and “our” refers to Bilibili Inc., its subsidiaries, and, in the context of
 describing our operations and consolidated financial information, the VIEs and their subsidiaries in China (collectively referred to as consolidated
 affiliated entities), including but not limited to, Hode Information Technology, which was established in May 2013 to expand our operations; and
 Shanghai Kuanyu, whose control was obtained by us in July 2014 to further expand our operations, and their subsidiaries.

       The following chart illustrates our company’s organizational structure, including our principal subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities as of
 the date of this annual report:

                                                                              5
Table of Contents




 Notes:
 (1)   Mr. Rui Chen holds 100% equity interests in Shanghai Kuanyu. He is also the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer.
 (2)   Shanghai Kuanyu has four subsidiaries.
 (3)   Mr. Rui Chen, Mr. Yi Xu and Ms. Ni Li hold 52.3%, 44.3%, and 3.4% equity interests in Hode Information Technology, respectively, as of the date of this annual report. Mr. Chen is
       our controlling shareholder, the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer. Mr. Xu is our founder, director and president. Ms. Li is the vice chairwoman of our
       board of directors and chief operating officer.
 (4)   Hode Information Technology has 35 subsidiaries.
 (5)   Chaodian (Shanghai) Technology Co., Ltd., or “Chaodian Technology”, has entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Shanghai Chaodian Culture Communication Co.,
       Ltd., or “Chaodian Culture”, and its individual shareholders, through which we obtained control over the operations of, and enjoyed all economic benefits of Chaodian Culture.
       Mr. Rui Chen, Mr. Yi Xu, Ms. Ni Li, Mr. Xujun Chai, Shanghai Kuanyu and Hode Information Technology hold 31.2%, 9.5%, 6.8%, 5.1%, 44.6% and 2.8% equity interests in
       Chaodian Culture, respectively, as of the date of this annual report. Mr. Xujun Chai is an employee of our company.

        Holders of our Class Z ordinary shares or the ADSs hold equity interest in Bilibili Inc., our Cayman Islands holding company, and do not have
 direct or indirect equity interests in the VIEs and their subsidiaries.A series of contractual agreements, including powers of attorney, equity pledge
 agreements, letter of undertakings, exclusive business cooperation agreements, and exclusive option agreements, have been entered into by and among
 our subsidiaries, the VIEs and their respective shareholders, as applicable. Terms contained in each set of contractual arrangements with the VIEs and
 their respective shareholders are substantially similar. As a result of the contractual arrangements, we have effective control over and are considered the
 primary beneficiary of these companies, and we have consolidated the financial results of these companies in our consolidated financial statements. For
 more details of these contractual arrangements, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure—Agreements that provide us
 effective control over the relevant VIEs.”

                                                                                               6
Table of Contents

       However, the contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over the VIEs and we may incur
 substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements. In addition, these agreements have not been tested in PRC courts. See “Item 3. Key
 Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—We rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders
 for our operations in China, which may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership” and “—The shareholders of the VIEs
 may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business.”

        There are also substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules regarding
 the status of the rights of Bilibili, a Cayman Islands holding company, with respect to its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their individual
 shareholders. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to VIE structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide.
 If we or any of the existing or past VIEs is found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of
 the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or
 failures. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—If the PRC government finds that the agreements
 that establish the structure for operating our businesses in China do not comply with PRC regulations on foreign investment in internet and other related
 businesses, or if these regulations or their interpretation change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our
 interests in those operations” and “—Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to how the Foreign Investment Law may impact the viability of our
 current corporate structure and operations.”

        Our corporate structure is subject to risks associated with our contractual arrangements with the VIEs. If the PRC government deems that our
 contractual arrangements with the VIEs do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these
 regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be
 forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, and investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential
 future actions by the PRC government that could affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly
 affect the financial performance of the VIEs and our company as a whole. For a detailed description of the risks associated with our corporate structure,
 please refer to risks disclosed under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure.”

       PRC government’s significant authority in regulating our operations and its oversight and control over offerings conducted overseas by, and
 foreign investment in, China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors.
 Implementation of industry-wide regulations, including data security or anti-monopoly related regulations, in this nature may cause the value of such
 securities to significantly decline or be of little or no value. For more details, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing
 Business in China—The PRC government’s significant oversight over our business operation could result in a material adverse change in our operations
 and the value of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs.”

       Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and quickly
 evolving rules and regulations in China, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities. For more details, see
 “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC
 laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us.”


 Permissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations
       We conduct our business primarily through our subsidiaries and VIEs in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and
 regulations. As of the date of this annual report, our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs have obtained the requisite licenses and permits from the PRC
 government authorities that are material for the business operations of Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs in China, including, among others, Value-
 added Telecommunication Business Licenses, License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, Online Culture Operating Permits and
 License for Production and Operation of Radio and Television Program. Given the uncertainties of interpretation and implementation of relevant laws
 and regulations and the enforcement practice by relevant government authorities, we may be required to obtain additional licenses, permits, filings or
 approvals for the functions and services of our platform in the future. For more detailed information, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We face uncertainties with respect to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and
 Notice 3.” and “—If we fail to obtain and maintain the licenses and approvals required within the complex regulatory environment applicable to our
 businesses in China, or if we are required to take compliance actions that are time-consuming or costly, our business, financial condition and results of
 operations may be materially and adversely affected.”


                                                                              7

       Furthermore, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas
 and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers. On December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued a draft of the Provisions of the State Council on the
 Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, and a draft of Administration Measures for the Filing of Overseas
 Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, for public comments, according to which, the issuer or its affiliated major domestic operating
 company, as the case may be, shall file with the CSRC and report the relevant information for its follow-on offshore offering and other equivalent
 offshore offering activities. As of the date of this annual report, the aforementioned draft provisions have not been adopted and there still exists
 substantial uncertainties surrounding the CSRC requirements at this stage. The approval of, or report and filing with the CSRC, or other governmental
 authorities may be required in connection with our future offshore offerings, and, if required, we cannot predict if we will be able to obtain such
 approval or complete such report and filing process.

        For more detailed information, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The approval of, or
 report and fillings with the CSRC or other PRC government authorities may be required in connection with our offshore offerings under PRC law, and,
 if required, we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such filing and report process.”


 The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
        The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states if the SEC determines
 that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting
 Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB, for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit our shares or ADSs from being
 traded on a national securities exchange. Since our auditor is located in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB has been unable to conduct inspections
 without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditor is not currently inspected by the PCAOB, which may impact our ability to remain listed on a
 United States exchange. The related risks and uncertainties could cause the value of the ADSs to significantly decline. For more details, see “Item 3.
 Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to
 their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor deprives our investors
 with the benefits of such inspections” and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The ADSs will be
 prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to
 inspect or fully investigate auditors located in China, or in 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of
 their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.”


 Cash and Asset Flows through Our Organization
       Bilibili Inc. transfers cash to its wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiaries, by making capital contributions or providing loans, and the Hong Kong
 subsidiaries transfer cash to the subsidiaries in China by making capital contributions or providing loans to them. Because Bilibili Inc. and its
 subsidiaries control the VIEs through contractual arrangements, they are not able to make direct capital contribution to the VIEs and their subsidiaries.
 However, they may transfer cash to the VIEs by loans or by making payments to the VIEs for inter-group transactions.

       Prior to December 31, 2019, Bilibili Inc., through its intermediate holding companies, had provided capital contribution and loans of aggregately
 RMB4.1billion to its subsidiaries in China. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, Bilibili Inc., through its intermediate holding companies,
 had provided capital contribution and loans of aggregately RMB5.3 billion and RMB7.6 billion (US$1,201.5 million) to its subsidiaries in China. For
 the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the VIEs received financings of RMB1.3 billion, RMB990.3 million and RMB3.3 billion
 (US$519.0 million) from WFOEs, respectively.

                                                                              8
Table of Contents

        The VIEs may transfer cash to our WFOEs by paying consulting and services charges according to the exclusive business cooperation agreement,
 and the VIEs may receive cash from our WFOEs under business agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the VIEs paid of
 aggregately RMB 551.8 million and 488.9 million to WFOEs. For the years ended December 31, 2021, the VIEs received of aggregately RMB
 1.0 billion from WFOEs.

        For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, no dividends or distributions were made to Bilibili Inc. by our subsidiaries. Under PRC
 laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs are subject to certain restrictions with respect to paying dividends or otherwise transferring any of
 their net assets to us. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned enterprise out of China is also subject to examination by the banks designated
 by SAFE. The amounts restricted include the paid-up capital and the statutory reserve funds of our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, in a total of
 RMB1.8 billion, RMB1.2 billion and RMB3.8 billion (US$598.2 million) as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Furthermore, cash
 transfers from our PRC subsidiaries to entities outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency conversion. Shortages in the
 availability of foreign currency may temporarily delay the ability of our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends
 or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. For risks relating to the fund flows of our operations in
 China, see “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Doing Business in China—We may rely on dividends paid by our PRC
 subsidiaries to fund cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material
 adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and to pay dividends to our shareholders and ADS holders.”

       In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, no assets other than cash were transferred through our organization.

       Bilibili Inc. has not declared or paid any cash dividends, nor does it have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on its ordinary shares in the
 foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. See
 “Item 8. Financial Information—A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—Dividend Policy.” For the Cayman Islands, PRC and
 U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to an investment in our Class Z ordinary shares or the ADSs, see “Item 10. Additional Information—
 E. Taxation.” For purposes of illustration, the following discussion reflects the hypothetical taxes that might be required to be paid within China and
 Hong Kong, assuming that: (i) we have taxable earnings, and (ii) we determine to pay a dividend in the future:

                                                                                                                                   Taxation Calculation(1)
                              Hypothetical pre-tax earnings(2)                                                                                       100.0%
                              Tax on earnings at statutory rate of 25%(3)                                                                            (25.0)%
                              Net earnings available for distribution                                                                                 75.0%
                              Withholding tax at standard rate of 10%(4)                                                                              (7.5)%
                              Net distribution to Parent/Shareholders                                                                                 67.5%

 Notes:
 (1)   For purposes of this example, the tax calculation has been simplified. The hypothetical book pre-tax earnings amount, not considering timing differences, is assumed to equal Chinese
       taxable income.
 (2)   Under the terms of VIE agreements, our PRC subsidiaries may charge the VIEs for services provided to VIEs. These fees shall be recognized as expenses of the VIEs, with a
       corresponding amount as service income by our PRC subsidiaries and eliminate in consolidation. For income tax purposes, our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs file income tax returns on a
       separate company basis. The fees paid are recognized as a tax deduction by the VIEs and as income by our PRC subsidiaries and are tax neutral.
 (3)   Certain of our subsidiaries and VIEs qualifies for a 15% preferential income tax rate in China. However, such rate is subject to qualification, temporary in nature, and may not be
       available in a future period when distributions are paid. For purposes of this hypothetical example, the table above reflects a maximum tax scenario under which the full statutory rate
       would be effective.
 (4)   PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a Foreign Invested Enterprises (“FIE”) to its immediate holding company
       outside of China. A lower withholding income tax rate of 5% is applied if the FIE’s immediate holding company is registered in Hong Kong or other jurisdictions that have a tax treaty
       arrangement with China, subject to specific qualification requirements at the time of the distribution. For purposes of this hypothetical example, the table above assumes a maximum
       tax scenario under which the full withholding tax would be applied even though we have Hong Kong subsidiaries and would likely make any dividends through them.

                                                                                              9

       The table above has been prepared under the assumption that all profits of the VIEs will be distributed as fees to our PRC subsidiaries under tax
 neutral contractual arrangements. If in the future, the accumulated earnings of the VIEs exceed the fees paid to our PRC subsidiaries (or if the current
 and contemplated fee structure between the intercompany entities is determined to be non-substantive and disallowed by Chinese tax authorities), the
 VIEs could, as a matter of last resort, make a non-deductible transfer to our PRC subsidiaries for the amounts of the stranded cash in the VIEs. This
 would result in such transfer being non-deductible expenses for the VIEs but still taxable income for the PRC subsidiaries. Such a transfer and the
 related tax burdens would reduce our after-tax income to approximately 50.6% of the pre-tax income. Our management believes that there is only a
 remote possibility that this scenario would happen.

 D.    Risk Factors
 Summary Risk Factors
       Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect
 our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not
 limited to, risks related to:


 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
  •    We operate in a fast-evolving industry. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully implement our commercialization strategies or develop new
       ones, or generate sustainable revenues and profit.
  •    We have incurred significant losses and we may continue to experience losses in the future.
  •    If we fail to anticipate user preferences and provide products and services to attract and retain users, or if we fail to keep up with rapid changes in
       technologies and their impact on user behavior, we may not be able to attract sufficient user traffic to remain competitive, and our business and
       prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
  •    Our business depends on our ability to provide users with interesting and useful content, which in turn depends on the content contributed by the
       content creators on our platform.
  •    Our business generates and processes a large amount of data, and we are required to comply with PRC and other applicable laws relating to
       privacy and cybersecurity. The improper use or disclosure of data could have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.
  •    Any compromise of cybersecurity of our platform could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and reputation.
  •    Increases in the costs of content on our platform may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
  •    If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is deemed to violate any PRC
       laws or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
  •    If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is considered inappropriate or
       offensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
  •    We face uncertainties with respect to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and Notice 3.


 Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
  •    We are a Cayman Islands holding company conducting our operations primarily through our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries in
       China; we have no equity ownership in the VIEs and their subsidiaries. Holders of our Class Z ordinary shares or the ADSs hold equity interest in
       Bilibili Inc., our Cayman Islands holding company, and do not have direct or indirect equity interests in the VIEs and their subsidiaries. If the PRC
       government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our business do not comply with PRC laws and regulations, or if
       these regulations or their interpretations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in
       those operations. Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, and investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC
       government that could affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial
       performance of the VIEs and our company as a whole.

                                                                              14

     •   If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our businesses in China do not comply with PRC
         regulations on foreign investment in internet and other related businesses, or if these regulations or their interpretation change in the future, we
         could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.


 Risks Related to Doing Business in China
 •       The PRC government’s significant authority in regulating our operations and its oversight and control over offerings conducted overseas by, and
         foreign investment in, China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to
         investors. Implementation of industry-wide regulations in this nature may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline. Uncertainties
         in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us.
 •       We face uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy
         Sector and other anti-monopoly and competition laws and how it may impact our business operations.
 •       The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the
         PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of such inspections.
 •       The ADSs will be prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, in 2024 if
         the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully investigate auditors located in China, or in 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting
         of the ADSs, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.
 •       The approval of, or report and fillings with the CSRC or other PRC government authorities may be required in connection with our offshore
         offerings under PRC law, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such
         filing and report process.
 •       Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the mobile and internet in China may adversely affect our business and subject us to
         liability for content posted on our platform.


 Risks Related to Our Listed Securities
 •       The trading price of our listed securities have been and are likely to continue to be volatile, regardless of our operating performance, which could
         result in substantial losses to our investors.
 •       We adopt different practices as to certain matters as compared with many other companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.


 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
 We operate in a fast-evolving industry. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully implement our commercialization strategies or develop new
 ones, or generate sustainable revenues and profit.
        We operate in a fast-evolving industry, and our commercialization model is evolving. We generate revenues primarily by providing our users with
 valuable content, such as videos, mobile games and live broadcasting. We also generate revenues from advertising, e-commerce and other services. We
 cannot assure you that we can successfully implement the existing commercialization strategies to sustainably generate growing revenues, or that we
 will be able to develop new commercialization strategies to grow our revenues. If our strategic initiatives do not enhance our ability to commercialize or
 enable us to develop new commercialization approaches, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues or recover any associated costs. In
 addition, we may introduce new products and services to expand our revenue streams, including products and services with which we have little or no
 prior development or operating experience. If these new or enhanced products or services fail to engage users, content creators or business partners, we
 may fail to diversify our revenue streams or generate sufficient revenues to justify our investments and costs, and our business and operating results may
 suffer as a result.

                                                                                15

 We have incurred significant losses and we may continue to experience losses in the future.
        We have incurred significant losses in the past. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, we had loss from operations of RMB1,495.2 million,
 RMB3,141.0 million, and RMB6,429.1 million (US$1,008.9 million), respectively. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate profits in the
 future. Our ability to achieve profitability depends in large part on our ability to manage our costs and expenses. We intend to manage and control our
 costs and expenses as a proportion of our total revenues, but there can be no assurance that we will achieve this goal. We may experience losses in the
 future due to our continued investments in technology, talent, content, brand recognition, expanding user base and other initiatives. In addition, our
 ability to achieve and sustain profitability is affected by various factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in macroeconomic and
 regulatory environment or competitive dynamics in the industry. Accordingly, you should not rely on our financial results of any prior period as an
 indication of our future performance.


 If we fail to anticipate user preferences and provide products and services to attract and retain users, or if we fail to keep up with rapid changes in
 technologies and their impact on user behavior, we may not be able to attract sufficient user traffic to remain competitive, and our business and
 prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
       Our ability to retain, grow and engage our user base depends heavily on our ability to provide a superior user experience. We must offer quality
 content covering a wide range of interests and formats, introduce successful new products and services, develop user-friendly platform features, and
 push effective content feeds recommendations. In particular, we must encourage content creators to upload more appealing professional user generated
 content and we must source more popular licensed content. We must also keep providing our users with features and functions that could enable superior
 content viewing and social interaction experience. If we are unable to provide a superior user experience, our user base and user engagement may
 decline, which may materially and adversely affect our business and growth prospects.

       We maintain a large content library primarily consisting of PUGV and OGV, and are developing new features to attract and retain our users. In
 order to expand our content library, we must continue to work with our content creators and incentivize them to produce content that reflects cultural
 trends and maintain good business relationships with licensors of premium copyrighted content to renew our licenses and source new professionally
 produced content. Our content creators and licensors may choose to work with other large online video platforms to distribute their content if such
 platforms can offer better products, services or terms than we do. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract our content creators to upload their
 content to our platform or renew or enter into license agreements on commercially reasonable terms with our licensors or at all.

        In addition, the industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and changing user expectations. To remain
 competitive, we must adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and improve the performance and reliability of our products and
 services to be able to adapt to these changes and innovate in response to evolving user expectations. Developing and integrating new content, products,
 services and technologies into our existing platform could be expensive and time-consuming, and these efforts may not yield the benefits we expect. If
 we fail to develop new products, services or innovative technologies on a timely basis, or our new products, services or technologies are not accepted by
 our users, our business, financial performance and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we can anticipate
 user preferences and industry changes and respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner. In addition, changes in user behavior resulting
 from technological developments may also adversely affect us. For example, the number of people accessing the internet through mobile devices,
 including mobile phones, tablets and other hand-held devices, has increased in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue while 4G, 5G and more
 advanced mobile communications technologies are broadly implemented. If we fail to develop products and technologies that are compatible with all
 mobile devices, or if the products and services we develop are not widely accepted and used by users of various mobile devices, we may not be able to
 penetrate the mobile markets. In addition, the widespread adoption of new internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other
 technological changes could require substantial expenditures to modify or integrate our products, services or infrastructure. If we fail to keep up with
 rapid technological changes to remain competitive, our future success may be adversely affected.

                                                                             16

 Our business depends on our ability to provide users with interesting and useful content, which in turn depends on the content contributed by the
 content creators on our platform.
        The quality of the content offered on our platform and our users’ level of engagement are critical to our success. In order to attract and retain users
 and compete effectively, we must offer interesting and useful content and enhance our users’ viewing experience. It is vital to our operations that we
 remain sensitive to and responsive to evolving user preferences and offer content that appeals to our users. In 2021, 92.7% of the total video views are of
 PUGV, as compared to 91.4% in 2020. Thus far, we have been generally able to encourage our content creators to create and upload PUGV that are
 appealing to our users. We have also been providing our content creators with support and guidance in various forms, including tools and products to
 help realize their commercial values and technical support for content distribution, editing and uploading. However, we cannot assure you that our
 content creators can contribute to create popular PUGV for our platform. If our content creators cease to contribute content, or their uploaded content
 fails to attract or retain our users, we may experience a decline in user traffic and user engagement. If the number of users or the level of user
 engagement declines, we may suffer a reduction in revenue.


 Our business generates and processes a large amount of data, and we are required to comply with PRC and other applicable laws relating to privacy
 and cybersecurity. The improper use or disclosure of data could have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.
       Our business generates and processes a large quantity of data. We face risks inherent in handling and protecting large volume of data. In particular,
 we face a number of challenges relating to data from transactions and other activities on our platforms, including:
  •    protecting the data in and hosted on our system, including against attacks on our system by outside parties or fraudulent behavior or improper use
       by our employees;
  •    addressing concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security and other factors; and
  •    complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure and security of personal
       information, including any requests from regulatory and government authorities relating to these data.

        In general, we expect that data security and data protection compliance will receive greater attention and focus from regulators, both domestically
 and globally, as well as attract continued or greater public scrutiny and attention going forward, which could increase our compliance costs and subject
 us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If we are unable to manage these risks, we could become subject to
 penalties, including fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, and our reputation and results of operations could be materially
 and adversely affected.

        The PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to data security and data protection is evolving and may be subject to different
 interpretations or significant changes. Moreover, different PRC regulatory bodies, including the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress,
 or the SCNPC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the CAC, the Ministry of
 Public Security, or the MPS and State Administration of Market Regulation, or the SAMR, have enforced data privacy and protections laws and
 regulations with varying standards and applications. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations
 Related to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection.” The following are examples of certain recent PRC regulatory activities in this area:

                                                                              17
Table of Contents

      Data Security
  •   In June 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the Data Security Law, which took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law, among other things,
      provides for security review procedure for data-related activities that may affect national security. In July 2021, the state council promulgated the
      Regulations on Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure, which became effective on September 1, 2021. Pursuant to this regulation, critical
      information infrastructure means key network facilities or information systems of critical industries or sectors, such as public communication and
      information service, energy, transportation, water conservation, finance, public services, e-government affairs and national defense science, the
      damage, malfunction or data leakage of which may endanger national security, people’s livelihoods and the public interest. In December 2021, the
      CAC, together with other authorities, jointly promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective on February 15, 2022 and
      replaces its predecessor regulation. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, critical information infrastructure operators that procure
      internet products and services must be subject to the cybersecurity review if their activities affect or may affect national security. The
      Cybersecurity Review Measures further stipulates that network platform operators that hold personal information of over one million users shall
      apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before any public listing in a foreign country. As of the date of this annual
      report, no detailed rules or implementation rules have been issued by any authority and we have not been informed that we are a critical
      information infrastructure operator by any government authorities. Furthermore, the exact scope of “critical information infrastructure operators”
      under the current regulatory regime remains unclear, and the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and
      enforcement of the applicable laws. Therefore, it is uncertain whether we would be deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator
      under PRC law. If we are deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we may be
      subject to obligations in addition to what we have fulfilled under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations.
  •   In November 2021, the CAC released the Regulations of Internet Data Security Management (Draft for Comments), or the Draft Regulations. The
      Draft Regulations provide that data processors refer to individuals or organizations that, during their data processing activities such as data
      collection, storage, utilization, transmission, publication and deletion, have autonomy over the purpose and the manner of data processing. In
      accordance with the Draft Regulations, data processors shall apply for a cybersecurity review for certain activities, including, among other things,
      (i) the listing in a foreign country of data processors that process the personal information of more than one million users and (ii) any data
      processing activity that affects or may affect national security. However, there have been no clarifications from the relevant authorities as of the
      date of this annual report as to the standards for determining whether an activity is one that “affects or may affect national security.” In addition,
      the Draft Regulations requires that data processors that process “important data” or are listed overseas must conduct an annual data security
      assessment by itself or commission a data security service provider to do so, and submit the assessment report of the preceding year to the
      municipal cybersecurity department by the end of January each year. As of the date of this annual report, the Draft Regulations was released for
      public comment only, and their respective provisions and anticipated adoption or effective date may be subject to change with substantial
      uncertainty.


      Personal Information and Privacy
  •   In October 2020, the SCNPC revised and promulgated the Law of the PRC on the Protection of Minors (2020 Revision), which took effect on
      June 1, 2021, according to which, information processors must follow the principles of legality, legitimacy and necessity when processing
      personal information of minors via internet, and must obtain consent from minors’ parents or other guardians when processing personal
      information of minors under age of 14. Internet service providers must also promptly alert upon the discovery of publishing private information by
      minors via the internet and take necessary protective measures.
  •   In August 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law, which integrates the scattered rules with respect to personal
      information rights and privacy protection and took effect on November 1, 2021. We update our privacy policies from time to time to meet the
      latest regulatory requirements of PRC government authorities and adopt technical measures to protect data and ensure cybersecurity in a
      systematic way. Nonetheless, the Personal Information Protection Law elevates the protection requirements for personal information processing,
      and many specific requirements of this law remain to be clarified by the regulatory authorities, and courts in practice. We may be required to make
      further adjustments to our business practices to comply with the personal information protection laws and regulations.


                                                                             18
Table of Contents

        Many of the data-related legislations are relatively new and certain concepts thereunder remain subject to interpretation by the regulators. If any
 data that we possess belongs to data categories that are subject to heightened scrutiny, we may be required to adopt stricter measures for protection and
 management of such data. The Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Draft Regulations remain unclear on whether the relevant requirements will be
 applicable to companies that are already listed in the United States, such as us. We cannot predict the impact of the Cybersecurity Review Measures and
 the Draft Regulations, if any, at this stage, and we will closely monitor and assess any development in the rule-making process. If the Cybersecurity
 Review Measures and the enacted version of the Draft Regulations mandate clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific actions to be taken by
 issuers like us, we face uncertainties as to whether these additional procedures can be completed by us timely, or at all, which may subject us to
 government enforcement actions and investigations, fines, penalties, suspension of our non-compliant operations, or removal of our app from the
 relevant application stores, and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. As of the date of this annual report, we have not
 been involved in any formal investigations on cybersecurity review made by the CAC on such basis.

       In general, compliance with the existing PRC laws and regulations, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may
 enact in the future, related to data security and personal information protection, may be costly and result in additional expenses to us, and subject us to
 negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and business operations. There are also uncertainties with respect to how such laws and regulations
 will be implemented and interpreted in practice.

        In addition, regulatory authorities around the world have adopted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning
 data protection. These legislative and regulatory proposals, if adopted, and the uncertain interpretations and application thereof could, in addition to the
 possibility of fines, result in an order requiring that we change our data practices and policies, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
 results of operations. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, includes
 operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Economic Area. The GDPR establishes new
 requirements applicable to the processing of personal data, affords new data protection rights to individuals and imposes penalties for serious data
 breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under the GDPR for financial or non-financial losses. Although we do not conduct any business
 in the European Economic Area, in the event that residents of the European Economic Area access our website or our mobile platform and input
 protected information, we may become subject to provisions of the GDPR.


 Any compromise of the cybersecurity of our platform could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and reputation.
        Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and other customers’ information, and security breaches expose us to a
 risk of loss of this information, litigation and potential liability. We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees from time to time, and we have been
 able to rectify attacks without significant impact to our operations in the past. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error,
 malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users or other customers to disclose sensitive
 information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or other customers’ data or accounts, or may otherwise obtain access to such data or
 accounts. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not
 recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual
 or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose users and
 other customers, and may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims and regulatory fines and penalties. Any of these
 actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.

                                                                              19

 Increases in the costs of content on our platform may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
        We need to acquire or produce popular content to provide our users with an engaging and satisfying viewing experience. The acquisition of such
 content depends on our ability to retain our content creators, OGV partners and hosts of our live broadcasting programs. We recorded content costs in
 our cost of revenue of RMB1,001.6 million, RMB1,875.5 million, and RMB2,694.8 million (US$422.9 million) in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
 As our business develops, we may incur increasing costs to produce or license OGV content and obtain live broadcasting right. Increases in market
 prices for licensed content and live broadcasting rights may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 For example, in September 2020, we formed a strategic partnership with Riot Games, the developer of leading MOBA League of Legends, among
 others, for granting us a three-year exclusive license for live broadcasting the League of Legends Esports global events (in Mandarin only), including the
 world renowned League of Legends World Championship, Mid-Season Invitational, and All-Star Event in China beginning in 2020 through the 2023
 Mid-Season Invitational, at an aggregate purchase price of RMB800 million (US$125.5 million). If we are not able to procure licensed content at
 commercially acceptable costs, our business and results of operations will be adversely impacted. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient
 revenues to outpace the increase in market prices for licensed content, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
 affected. We rely on our in-house team to generate creative ideas for original OGV content and to supervise the original content origination and
 production process, and we intend to continue to invest resources in content production. If we are not able to compete effectively for talent or attract and
 retain top talent at reasonable costs, our original content production capabilities would be negatively impacted.


 If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is deemed to violate any PRC
 laws or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
        The PRC government and regulatory authorities have adopted regulations governing content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games,
 audios and other information over the internet. Under these regulations, internet content providers are prohibited from posting or displaying content that,
 among other things, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China or the public interest, or is obscene, superstitious,
 fraudulent, violent or defamatory on the internet. Internet content providers are also prohibited from displaying content that may be deemed by relevant
 government authorities as “socially destabilizing” or leaking “state secrets” of China. The PRC government and regulatory authorities strengthen the
 regulations on internet content from time to time, such as the Opinion on Strictly Regulating Online Game Market Management jointly adopted by a few
 authorities in December 2017, the Regulations on Administration of Network Short Video Platforms, promulgated in January 2019 by China Netcasting
 Services Association, or the CNSA, the Censoring Criteria for Network Short Video Content promulgated in January 2019 and last amended in
 December 2021, the Administrative Provisions on Online Audio-Visual Information Services, effective from January 1, 2020 and the Notice on
 Strengthening the Administration of Live Broadcasting of Game-Playing on the Online Audio-Visual Program Platform, issued in April 2022 by the
 Online Audio-Visual Program Administration Division of the National Radio and Television Administration of the PRC, or the NRTA (the successor of
 the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of China, or the SAPPRFT) and the Publishing Bureau of the Propaganda
 Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The enactment of these regulations may significantly increase our compliance
 costs in recruiting additional content reviewers and training them to identify the prohibited content timely and accurately. Any failure to comply with
 these regulations may subject us to liability. In November 2020, the NRTA further promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Management of Online
 Show Live Broadcasting and E-commerce Live Broadcasting (“Notice 78”) which requests the live broadcasting platforms for online shows to
 strengthen positive value guidance and to prevent the spread of the trends of wealth flaunting, money worshiping and vulgarity. In February 2021, the
 Notice on Promulgation of the Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Standardized Administration of Online Live Broadcasting, or Notice 3, was
 issued by the CAC and other governmental authorities, which further requires live broadcasting platforms to ensure correct orientation and content
 safety. On September 15, 2021, the CAC promulgated the Opinions on Further Compacting the Main Responsibility of the Website Platform on
 Information Content Management, which regulates the content and quality of the information and further requires the website platform to improve the
 content review mechanism. On October 26, 2021, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, or the OCCAC, issued the Notice on
 Further Strengthening the Regulation on Online Information of Entertainment Celebrities. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the
 Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs” and “Item 4. Information on
 the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”

                                                                             20

       In addition to licensed content provided by copyright owners, we allow our users to upload content to our platform. Our users can upload all types
 of content including self-created and professionally produced content and certain graphical files for the purpose of updating user biographies and content
 covers. Currently only registered users are allowed to upload content to our platform. We maintain two levels of content management and review
 procedures to monitor the content uploaded to our platform to ensure that no content that may be deemed to be prohibited by government rules and
 regulations is posted and to promptly remove any infringing content. Our content screening team screens and monitors the content uploaded on our
 platform on a 24-hour, 7-day basis. For more details relating to our content monitoring procedures, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B.
 Business Overview—Content Management and Review.” However, there can be no assurance that we can identify all the videos or other content that
 may violate relevant laws and regulations due to the large amount of content uploaded by our users every day.


 If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is considered inappropriate or
 offensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
       Failure to identify and prevent illegal or inappropriate content from being uploaded and/or streamed on our platform may subject us to liability. To
 the extent that PRC regulatory authorities find any content on our platform objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of
 such content on our platform in the form of take-down orders, cause our app to be temporarily removed from app stores, or temporarily disable certain
 functions on our platform, or otherwise. For example, the CAC conducted a nationwide inspection of major internet platforms providing short-video
 content, and we were notified by certain smartphone app stores in China that our mobile app had been temporarily removed from July 26, 2018 until
 August 25, 2018. We implemented the required measures promptly and reinstated the mobile app downloads from those app stores on August 26, 2018.
 We thereafter conducted a self-inspection by taking a comprehensive review of the content on our platform and have hired more content monitoring
 personnel. Our app may be removed from app stores again in the future, and such removal could materially and adversely affect our business operations.
 On December 3, 2020, in response to the reported vulgar content on our platform, the Shanghai Municipal Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal
 Publication, the Shanghai Municipal Internet Information Office and the Shanghai Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau made inquiries with us and
 requested us to rectify within two weeks and strengthen the content review of videos, live broadcasting, anime, bullet chatting and other content on our
 platform. We have completed the required rectification and submitted the final rectification report to the Shanghai Municipal Office of Anti-
 Pornography and Illegal Publication and the Shanghai Municipal Internet Information Office on December 22, 2020 and our rectification report has been
 accepted by the relevant competent authorities.

       In addition, PRC laws and regulations are subject to interpretation by the relevant authorities, and it may not be possible to determine in all cases
 the types of content that could result in our liability as a platform operator. We may also face liability for copyright or trademark infringement, fraud and
 other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that are delivered, shared or otherwise accessed through or displayed on our platform.

       Furthermore, reports or publicity of violence and crimes related to our PUGV, OGV, online games, live broadcasting programs or any claims of
 our PUGV, OGV, online game or live broadcasting content to be considered, among others, obscene, superstitious, fraudulent, defamatory, inappropriate,
 offensive or impairing public interest, may result in negative publicity, harm to our brand or a regulatory response that might have a material and
 adverse impact on our business. Any claim of us failing to identify any content a viewer may find objectionable may result in negative publicity, harm to
 our brand or regulatory actions, which in turn might have a material and adverse impact on our business. We generate a portion of our revenues from
 advertising. Our advertising revenues might be materially and adversely affected by any decision by advertisers to reduce their advertising as a result of
 adverse media reports, user complaints or other negative publicity involving us or, content on our platform. In addition, reductions of advertising by
 advertisers due to allegedly objectionable content made available on our platform by content creators, licensors, or other third parties, concerns about
 our content management practices, concerns about brand reputation or potential liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance
 obligations, may also materially and adversely affect our advertising revenues.

                                                                              21

 We face uncertainties with respect to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and Notice 3.
        According to Notice 78, platforms providing online show live broadcasting or e-commerce live broadcasting services shall, among other things,
 register their information and business operations by November 30, 2020, ensure real-name registration for all live broadcasting hosts and virtual gifting
 users, prohibit users that are minors or without real-name registration from virtual gifting, and set a limit on the maximum amount of virtual gifting per
 time, per day, and per month.

        As advised by our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, there is currently no explicit provisions as to what limits on virtual gifting will be imposed
 by the NRTA pursuant to Notice 78 and it is unclear how and to what degree any such limits would be imposed on different platforms. Currently, users
 who can be identified as minors are not allowed to make virtual gifts. However, given there is no explicit provisions on how to set the limit on virtual
 gifting, we have not been able to set such limit on our platform. We recorded revenues generated from our live broadcasting business under VAS. We
 derived 24.2%, 32.0% and 35.8% of our revenues from VAS in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Any such limits ultimately imposed may negatively
 impact our revenues derived from virtual gifting and our results of operations.

       Notice 78 also requests the live broadcasting platforms for online shows to register in the National Internet Audio-Visual Platforms Information
 Management System, however, in our communication with Shanghai Municipal Administration of Radio and Television, we were informed that
 currently we are not required to register in this system. We cannot guarantee that we will not be required to register in the National Internet Audio-
 Visual Platform Information Management System in the future, and if so required, whether we will be able to complete the registration in a timely
 manner, or at all. Notice 78 also sets forth requirements for certain live broadcasting businesses with respect to real-name registration, limits on user
 spending on virtual gifting, restrictions on minors on virtual gifting, live broadcasting review personnel requirements, content tagging requirements, and
 other requirements. For more information on Notice 78, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations
 Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”

        In February 2021, CAC and certain other governmental authorities issued Notice 3, according to which, online live broadcasting platforms
 providing online live broadcasting information services shall strictly abide by laws, regulations and regulatory requirements of the PRC, and shall
 strictly perform their statutory duties and obligations, implement the list of primary responsibilities of online live broadcasting platforms and ensure
 correct orientation and content safety. Meanwhile, Notice 3 sets forth requirements for certain live broadcasting businesses with respect to real-name
 registration, restrictions on minors on virtual gifting and other requirements, and further strengthens the industry admittance filing management. For
 example, a live broadcasting platform that carries out business-oriented network performance activities must hold an internet cultural business license
 and complete ICP filing; and a live broadcasting platform that carries out online audio-visual program services must hold a License for Online
 Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs or complete registration with the National Internet Audio-Visual Platforms Information Management System,
 and complete ICP filing.

        Since Notice 78 and Notice 3 were newly issued and some of the requirements in them are unclear and have no explicit provisions or
 implementation standards, we are still in the process of getting further guidance from regulatory authorities and evaluating the applicability and effect of
 the various requirements under these notices on our business. Any further rulemaking under these notices or other intensified regulation with respect to
 live broadcasting may increase our compliance burden in the live broadcasting business, and may have an adverse impact on our business and results of
 operations.


 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business, which could negatively impact our brand and
 financial performance.
        We have experienced rapid growth since our inception in 2011. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be influenced by our
 ability to add, retain and engage active users of our products. Our user acquisition and engagement may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our
 control, such as the shelter-in-place restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced a significant increase in the size and engagement
 of our active user base during the first quarter of 2020 partly due to the shelter-in-place restrictions in China. Although we have been able to maintain
 the momentum of user growth and engagement since then as China gradually relaxed its shelter-in-place restrictions, we may not be able to maintain the
 growth of our active user base or user acquisition and the level of engagement in the long term.

                                                                             22
Table of Contents

        As we grow our user base and increase the level of user engagement, we may incur increasing costs, such as licensing fees and royalties for
 licensed content and hosts’ compensation to further expand our content library to meet the growing and diversified demands of our users. If such
 expansion is not properly managed, it may adversely affect our financial and operating resources without achieving the desired effects. The market
 prices for licensing fees and royalties for licensed content, such as license for live broadcasting popular e-sport events, have increased significantly in
 China during the past few years. Online video broadcasting programs are competing aggressively to license popular content titles and events, driving
 licensing fees up in general. As the market further grows, copyright owners, distributors and industry participants may demand higher licensing fees for
 such content. Furthermore, as our content library expands, we expect the costs of licensed content to continue to increase. If we are unable to generate
 sufficient revenues to outpace the increase in costs, we may incur more losses and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be
 adversely affected. See “—Increases in the costs of content on our platform may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
 of operations.”

        We also anticipate further expansion in global markets. Such expansion will increase the complexity of our operations and might place a
 significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We are also exposed to the political, social or economic instability in overseas
 markets or regions in which we operate, and such tensions may impact our successful expansion into the overseas market. See also “—We face various
 challenges and risks in connection with our expansion into overseas markets.”

       As we only have a limited history of operating our business at its current scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects,
 including our ability to grow in the future. In addition, our costs and expenses may increase rapidly as we expand our business and continue to invest in
 our infrastructure to enhance the performance and reliability of our platform. For example, we may increase our investment in servers and bandwidth to
 maintain our quality user experience while sustaining the growth of user base. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service
 levels for our users, content creators and business partners, develop and improve our operational, financial, legal and management controls, and enhance
 our reporting systems and procedures. Our costs and expenses may grow faster than our revenues and may be greater than what we anticipate. If we are
 unable to generate adequate revenues and to manage our costs and expenses, we may continue to incur losses in the future and may not be able to
 achieve or subsequently maintain profitability. Managing our growth will require significant expenditures and the allocation of valuable management
 resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results and financial condition
 could be harmed.


 We have a unique community culture that is vital to our success. Our operations may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to maintain our
 culture and brand image within our addressable user communities.
        Our users have developed a unique community culture that distinguishes us from other online content providers. Our users come to our platform
 for creative content covering a wide array of cultures and interests as well as for strong, vibrant and safe communities. We believe that maintaining and
 promoting such community culture is critical to retaining and expanding our user base. We have taken multiple initiatives to preserve our community
 culture and values, such as requiring users to pass a membership exam before they are allowed to send bullet chats and utilize other interactive functions
 on our platform, and temporarily blocking or permanently deleting accounts of users who posted inappropriate content or comments.

        Despite our efforts, we may be unable to maintain and foster our unique community culture and cease to be the preferred platform for our target
 users and content creators. As our user base is expanding, we may have difficulties in guiding our new users to honor and abide by our community
 values despite the initiatives we have adopted and may adopt in the future. In such event, our user engagement and loyalty may suffer, which would in
 turn negatively affect user traffic and our attractiveness to other customers and partners. In addition, frictions among our users and inflammatory
 comments posted by internet trolls may damage our community culture and brand image, which would be detrimental to our operations. Historically,
 some incidents of intense frictions among our users who belonged to different micro-interests and fans groups disrupted our operations. Users who have
 met through our services may become involved in emotionally charged situations and could suffer adverse moral, emotional or physical consequences.
 Such events could be highly publicized and have a significant negative impact on our reputation. Government authorities may require us to discontinue
 or restrict the relevant services. As a result, our business could suffer and our user base and results of operations may be materially and adversely
 affected.

                                                                              23

 If we fail to obtain and maintain the licenses and approvals required within the complex regulatory environment applicable to our businesses in
 China, or if we are required to take compliance actions that are time-consuming or costly, our business, financial condition and results of operations
 may be materially and adversely affected.
       The internet and mobile industries in China are highly regulated. Our consolidated affiliated entities are required to obtain and maintain applicable
 licenses and approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to provide their current services. However, we cannot assure you that we can
 successfully renew these licenses in a timely manner or that these licenses are sufficient to conduct all of our present or future business. As we develop
 and expand our business scope, we may need to obtain additional qualifications, permits, approvals or licenses. We may be required to obtain additional
 licenses or approvals if the PRC government adopts more stringent policies or regulations for our business.

       The expiration date of the major subsidiary’s Online Culture Operating Permits granted by the local branch of MCT ranges from June 2022 to
 December 2023, which were all renewed after May 2019. As the MCT ceased to assume the responsibility for the administration of the online game
 industry and no longer approved or issued the Online Culture Operating Permits regarding online games since May 2019, the Online Culture Operating
 Permits held by our major subsidiary no longer contains content related to online games operation. Based on our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm’s
 consultation with the MCT in November 2020, the MCT no longer assumes the responsibility to supervise the operation of online games, and it is not
 necessary for an enterprise to obtain Online Culture Operating Permits to operate online game operation business. As of the date of this annual report, no
 laws, regulations or official guidelines have been promulgated regarding whether the responsibility of MCT for regulating online games will be
 undertaken by another governmental department. Therefore, our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, has advised us that as long as there is no
 governmental authority promulgating new supervision requirements for the operation of online game, we are able to continue our online game operation
 business although the Online Culture Operating Permits currently held no longer contain content related to online games operation, which will not
 constitute any material noncompliance.

        The National Press and Publication Administration, or the NAPP, at the national level had suspended the approval of game registration and
 issuance of publication numbers for online games starting from March 2018, and later resumed game registration and issued game publication numbers
 for the first batch of games with an effective date of December 19, 2018. From August 2021, no new game registration and the publication numbers for
 online games were approved or issued from the NAPP at the national level until recently resumed in April 2022, and the processing time of games
 registration and issuance of publication numbers may vary greatly and is within the NAPP’s discretion. Any delay in game registration with NAPP or
 obtaining game publication numbers could lead to the termination of our cooperation agreements with third parties or negatively affect the operation
 results of our games. Under the Notice on Adjusting the Scope of Examination and Approval regarding the Internet Culture Operation License to
 Further Regulate the Approval Work released in May 2019, the Online Culture Operating Permits covering the business scope of using the information
 network to operate online games granted by the MCT before this notice will remain valid until the expiration dates of these permits. On July 10, 2019,
 the MCT announced the abolishment of the Interim Measures on Administration of Online Games, which regulated the issuance of Online Culture
 Operating Permits relating to online games. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—
 Regulations Related to Online Games.” As of the date of this annual report, the governmental authorities have not issued laws or regulations to replace
 the Interim Measures on Administration of Online Games, or to clarify the new regulatory body of online games. If we are unable to comply with the
 new regulations relating to our online games operations, our ability to introduce, launch and operate new games may be adversely affected, and our
 financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we cannot assure you that the suspension of the approval procedure of
 game registration and issuance of publication numbers would not occur again in the future and cannot predict how long such duration of suspension will
 be, and we cannot assure you that we or relevant third parties can obtain the NAPP’s approvals or complete any new governmental requirements for all
 games on our platform in a timely manner or at all, which could adversely and materially impact our ability to introduce new games, the timetable to
 launch new games and our business growth.

                                                                             24
Table of Contents

        Moreover, the provision of online games is deemed to be an internet publication activity. An online game operator may be required to obtain an
 Internet Publishing Service License in order to directly make those games publicly available in China. Although it is not specifically authorized by the
 NAPP, an online game operator is generally able to publish its games through third-party licensed electronic publishing entities and register the games
 with the NAPP as electronic publications, which is consistent with our practice as of the date of this annual report. In addition, the provision of comics
 online may be deemed to be an internet publication activity, which may require the content provider to obtain an Internet Publishing Service License.
 Furthermore, in a consultation with the competent government authorities in February 2022, our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, was informed that
 operation of an online comics business currently does not require the Internet Publishing Service License. However, for the future convenience to
 publish games by ourselves, we are planning to apply for the Internet Publishing Service License for our business operation and we have been
 continuously communicating with the competent authorities. However, there is no assurance that we will be granted such license. If we fail to complete,
 obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals or make the necessary filings, we may be subject to various penalties, such as confiscation
 of the net revenues that were generated through online games and comics, the imposition of fines, the revocation of our business and operating licenses
 and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations of online games and comics.

        Under the Administrative Regulations on the Introduction and Broadcasting of Foreign Television Programs, the introduction or broadcasting of
 foreign anime in China is subject to approval of the SAPPRFT or its authorized entities. Approval or filing procedures were previously not explicitly
 required in practice by the NRTA for the broadcasting and distribution of foreign anime on the internet only, until NRTA and its authorized authorities
 clarified and implemented the relevant filing procedure in 2021. Since then, based on our consultation with the relevant government authorities, we have
 been following the required filling procedure for our newly introduced foreign anime before broadcasting and distributing them on our platform.

        Considerable uncertainties exist in relation to the interpretation and implementation of existing and future laws and regulations governing our
 business activities. We could be found in violation of any future laws and regulations or of the laws and regulations currently in effect due to changes in
 the relevant authorities’ interpretation of these laws and regulations. If we fail to complete, obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals
 or make the necessary filings, we may be subject to various penalties, such as confiscation of the net revenues that were generated through the
 unlicensed internet or mobile activities, the imposition of fines and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations. Any such penalties or changes in
 policies, regulations or enforcement by government authorities, may disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial
 condition and results of operations.

        In August 2018, the National Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal Publication, the MIIT, the MPS, the MCT, the NRTA and the CAC jointly
 issued the Notice on Strengthening the Management of Live Broadcasting Service, which required a real-name registration system for users to be put in
 place by live broadcasting service providers. On October 25, 2019, the NAPP issued the Notice on Preventing Minors from Indulging in Online Games,
 which requires all online gamers to register accounts with their valid identity information and all game companies to stop providing game services to
 users who fail to do so. Pursuant to the Notice 78, users who have not registered with real names or who are minors are prohibited from virtual gifting.
 On October 17, 2020, the Law of the PRC on the Protection of Minors (2020 Revision) added a new section entitled “Online Protections” which
 stipulates a series of provisions to further protect minors’ interests on the internet. On August 30, 2021, the NAPP promulgated the Notice on Further
 Strict Management to Effectively Prevent Minors from Being Addicted to Online Games, which became effective on September 1, 2021. The notice
 requires that all online games must be connected to the real-name verification system of the NAPP for online games to prevent addiction, all online
 game users must use real and valid identity information to register their game accounts and log in to online games, and online games enterprises must
 not provide online game services in any form (including visitor experience mode) to users who have not registered and logged in with their real names.
 For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Games” and
 “Item 4. Information on the Company— B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.” On
 March 25, 2022, the CAC, the State Taxation Administration of the PRC, or the STA, and the SAMR jointly issued the Notice on Further Standardizing
 the Profit-Making Behavior of Live Broadcasting to Promote the Healthy Development of the Industry, which required live broadcasting platforms to
 authenticate the identity of each live broadcasting publisher and report various information of those publishers that have profit-making behaviors to local
 provincial-level network department and tax authorities semi-annually. For a detailed description, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B.
 Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”

                                                                              25

        We have implemented and we will continue to implement measures to comply with real-name registration requirements under PRC laws and
 regulations. However, the PRC government may further tighten the real-name registration requirements or require us to implement a more thorough
 compulsory real-name registration system for all users on our platform in the future, so that we will need to upgrade our system or purchase relevant
 services from third-party service providers and incur additional costs in relation thereto. If we were required to implement a more rigid real-name
 registration system for users on our platform, potential users may be deterred from registering with our platform, which may in turn negatively affect the
 growth of our user base and prospect.


 We face significant competition, primarily from companies that operate in the video-based industry in China, and we compete with these companies
 for users, content providers and advertisers.
        We face significant competition primarily from companies that operate in the video-based industry in China designed to engage users, especially
 the Generation Z+, and capture their time spent on mobile devices and the internet. In particular, our competitors mainly include large online video
 streaming platforms, other platforms offering video products, live broadcasting platforms, game developers and other companies offering online content.
 Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial resources than we do, and in turn may be able to attract and
 retain more users, content partners and advertisers. Our competitors may compete with us in a variety of ways, including by obtaining exclusive online
 distribution rights for popular content, conducting brand promotions and other marketing activities, and making acquisitions. If any of our competitors
 provides comparable or better user experience, our user traffic could decline significantly. We have exclusive distribution rights only for certain content
 on our platform. Our content creators are generally free to post their content on our competitors’ platforms, which may divert user traffic from our
 platform, and adversely affect our user traffic and thus our operations.

       We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
       •      the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our platform, products and services compared to those of our
              competitors;
       •      the amount, quality and timeliness of content on our platform, especially the amount and quality of the PUGV generated by our content
              creators;
       •      the environment and culture of our user communities;
       •      our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services to
              keep up with user preferences and demands;
       •      the inventory size, quality and size of player base of the games we operate;
       •      our ability to establish and maintain relationships with content providers and partners;
       •      our ability to commercialize our services;
       •      changes mandated by legislation, regulations or government policies, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;
       •      acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and
       •      our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.


 We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could result in material damage to our reputation and
 brand, payment of substantial damages, penalties and fines, removal of relevant content from our platform or seeking license arrangements which
 may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
       Content posted on our platform may expose us to allegations by third parties of infringement of intellectual property rights, unfair competition,
 invasion of privacy, defamation and other violations of third-party rights. We have been involved in litigation based on allegations of infringement of
 third-party copyright due to the content available on our platform. We are currently involved in approximately 210 lawsuits based on allegations of
 infringement of third-party copyright due to the content posted on our platform, which are immaterial to our company on an individual basis or a
 collective basis. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation that may be brought against us or our current or former directors and
 officers, could be time-consuming, result in significant expenses and divert our resources and the attention of our management and other key employees.
 An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed the limited coverage provided under our current applicable insurance policies.


                                                                               26

        Our failure to identify unauthorized videos posted on our platform may subject us to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property
 rights or other rights. Although we maintain content management and review procedures to monitor the content uploaded to our platform, due to the
 large number of videos uploaded, we may not be able to identify all content that may infringe on third-party rights. Such failure may subject us to
 potential claims and lawsuits, defending of which may impose a significant burden on our management and employees, and there can be no assurance
 that we will obtain final outcomes that are favorable to us. In addition, we may be subject to administrative actions brought by the National Copyright
 Administration of China or its local branches or related law enforcement departments for alleged copyright infringement.

       The validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internet-related industries, particularly in China, are uncertain
 and still evolving. As we face increasing competition and as litigation becomes a more common way to resolve disputes in China, we face a higher risk
 of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. Under relevant PRC laws and regulations, online service providers which provide
 storage space for users to upload works or links to other services or content could be held liable for copyright infringement under various circumstances,
 including situations where an online service provider knows or should reasonably have known that the relevant content uploaded or linked to on its
 platform infringes the copyrights of others and the provider realizes economic benefits from such infringement activities. In certain cases in China, the
 courts have found an online service provider to be liable for the copyrighted content posted by users which was accessible from and stored on such
 provider’s servers.

       Although we have not been subject to claims or lawsuits outside China, we may become subject to copyright laws in other jurisdictions, such as
 the United States, by virtue of our listing in the United States, the ability of users to access our videos from the United States and other jurisdictions, the
 ownership of the ADSs by investors, and the extraterritorial application of foreign law by foreign courts or otherwise.

       In addition, as a publicly listed company, we may be exposed to increased risk of litigation. If a claim of infringement brought against us in the
 United States or other jurisdictions is successful, we may be required to (i) pay substantial statutory or other damages and fines, (ii) remove relevant
 content from our platform, or (iii) enter into royalty or license agreements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

        Although we have required our users to post only legally compliant and inoffensive materials and have set up screening procedures, our screening
 procedures may fail to screen out all potentially offensive or non-compliant user-generated content and, even if properly screened, a third-party may still
 find user-generated content posted on our platform offensive and take action against us in connection with the posting of such content. We may also face
 litigation or administrative actions for defamation, negligence or other purported injuries resulting from the content we provide or the nature of our
 services. Such litigation and administrative actions, with or without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming, result in significant diversion of
 resources and management attention from our operations, and adversely affect our brand and reputation.

       Furthermore, our app may be taken down temporarily from Apple app store or other apps markets for copyright reasons, and we may be subject to
 copyright infringement claims brought by our competitors, which, malicious or not, may be time-consuming to defend and disrupting to our operations.

                                                                               27

 We may not be able to prevent others from engaging in unauthorized use of our intellectual property, unfair competition, defamation or other
 violations of our rights, which could harm our business and competitive position.
       We have invested significant resources to develop our own intellectual property and acquire licenses to use and distribute the intellectual property
 of others on our platform. Failure to maintain or protect these rights could harm our business. In addition, any unauthorized use of our intellectual
 property by third parties may adversely affect our current and future revenues and our reputation. Further, others may engage in conduct that constitutes
 unfair competition, defamation or other violations of our rights, which could harm our business, reputation and competitive position.

       Protection of intellectual property rights in the counties and regions that we operate may not be sufficient. Furthermore, policing unauthorized use
 of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on
 disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise
 obtain and use our intellectual property or seek court declarations that they do not infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Other unlawful conduct
 against us is also difficult to prevent and police. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our rights. From
 time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.


 We face intense competition for users and hosts, as well as strict regulatory supervision by government authorities, for our live broadcasting
 business.
       We face significant competition in the live broadcasting business for both users and hosts. The live broadcasting on our platform primarily focuses
 on interest areas including anime, game, music, fashion, lifestyle, and knowledge. We cannot assure you that such content will continue to attract new
 users and retain existing ones.

       We have entered into exclusive cooperation agreements with certain popular hosts on our platform. We may not be able to maintain or renew these
 agreements on acceptable terms or at all. In such event, we may be unable to convert content creators to be live broadcasting hosts or retain these
 popular hosts on our platform, and our operating results will be adversely affected. We cooperate with talent agencies to recruit, manage, train and
 support our hosts. Furthermore, we may lose hosts if the talent agencies that manage them are unable to reach or maintain satisfactory cooperation
 arrangements with such hosts. If talented and popular hosts cease to contribute content to our platform, or their live broadcasting fails to attract users, we
 may experience a decline in user traffic and user engagement, which may have material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial
 conditions.

       In addition, the costs attributed to hosts’ compensation have increased significantly in China during the past few years for companies that provide
 such services. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to outpace the increase in such compensation, we may lose opportunities to retain the
 popular hosts on our platform and thus incur more losses. In addition, the compensation we pay to the hosts could significantly increase our cost of
 revenues and materially adversely affect our margins, financial condition and results of operations.

        We cooperate with talent agencies to manage, organize and recruit hosts on our platform. As we are an open platform that welcomes all hosts to
 register on our websites, cooperation with talent agencies substantially increases our operation efficiency in terms of discovering, supporting and
 managing hosts in a more organized and structured manner, and turning amateur hosts to full-time hosts. We have a revenue sharing arrangement with
 both our hosts and talent agencies under which we share with them a portion of the revenues from virtual gifting. The absolute amounts and revenue
 sharing percentages that we pay hosts and talent agencies may increase. If the interests among us, hosts and the talent agencies are not well balanced, or
 if we cannot design a revenue-sharing mechanism that is agreeable to both hosts and talent agencies, we may not be able to retain or attract hosts or
 talent agencies, or both. In addition, while we have entered into exclusive streaming agreements with certain hosts, none of the talent agencies we
 cooperate with has an exclusive cooperation relationship with us. If our competitor platforms offer higher revenue sharing percentages with an intent to
 attract our popular hosts, costs to retain our hosts may further increase, additionally, talent agencies may choose to devote more of their resources to
 hosts who stream on other platforms, or they may encourage their hosts to use or even enter into an exclusive agreement with other platforms, all of
 which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to continue to retain our hosts
 and produce high-quality content on our platform at commercially acceptable costs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
 adversely impacted. Furthermore, as our business and user base further expand, we may have to devote more resources in encouraging our hosts and
 talent agencies to produce content that meets the varied interests of a diverse user base, which would increase the costs of content on our platform. If we
 are unable to generate sufficient revenues that outpace our increased content costs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be
 materially and adversely affected.

                                                                              28
Table of Contents

        In addition, our live broadcasting services may be abused by hosts and other users. We have an internal control system in place to review and
 monitor live broadcasting streams and will shut down those streams that may violate PRC laws and regulations. For detailed descriptions of these PRC
 laws and regulations, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Live
 Broadcasting Services.” However, we may not identify all such streams and content. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result
 in the revocation of our licenses to provide internet content or other licenses, the closure of the concerned platforms and reputational harm. We may also
 be held liable for such censored information displayed on our platform.


 If we fail to launch new games or release upgrades to existing games to grow our games’ player base, our business and operating results will be
 materially and adversely affected.
       We derived 53.1%, 40.0% and 26.3% of our revenues from mobile games in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We derived a significant portion
 of mobile game revenues from a limited number of games in 2019. One mobile game contributed more than 10% of our total net revenues, accounting
 for 30.9% and 11.4% of our total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. No mobile game individually contributed
 more than 10% of our total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

       We offer mobile games from third-party game developers and publishers on our platform either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. Therefore,
 we must maintain good relationships with our third-party game developers and copyright owners to obtain access to new popular games on reasonable
 commercial terms. We may not be able to maintain or renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all. In such event, we may be unable to continue
 offering these popular mobile games, and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, if our users decide to access these games through
 our competitors, or if they prefer other mobile games operated by our competitors, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In
 addition, if we fail to launch new games or release upgrades to existing games in a timely manner, or if our games do not achieve expected popularity,
 we may lose players of our games, which could materially and adversely impact our business. Even in the event that we succeed in launching new
 games, the new games may divert players away from the existing games on our platform, which may increase player churn and reduce revenues from
 our existing games.

       We also offer mobile games self-developed by our in-house game development teams. The development cycle for new titles can range from 12
 months to multiple years. Therefore, our development costs can be substantial. If we experience unanticipated development delays, financial difficulties,
 or additional costs, for example, as a result of COVID-19, we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs. External
 factors, such as changing interests and appetite of game players and market trends, may also have an impact on the successful launch and popularity of
 any new games. Despite the substantial costs and time needed for development of new games, there can be no assurance that we can recoup these costs
 or make a profit on these games.

       In addition, the revenue model we adopt for online games may not remain effective, which may cause us to lose players and materially and
 adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We derive substantially all of the mobile games revenues from the sale of
 in-game virtual items. However, we may not be able to continue to successfully implement this model.


 The PRC government has taken steps to limit online game playing time for all minors and to otherwise control the content and operation of online
 games. Such restrictions on online games may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.
        As part of its anti-addiction online game policy, the PRC regulators have been implementing regulations designed to reduce the amount of time
 that youth under the age of 18 spend playing online games. For a detailed description of these regulations, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—
 B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Games—Anti-addiction System and Protection of Minors.” On August 30, 2021,
 the NAPP promulgated the Notice on Further Strict Management to Effectively Prevent Minors from Being Addicted to Online Games, which became
 effective on September 1, 2021. The notice requires that all online games enterprises including platforms providing online game services may only
 provide online game services to minors for one hour from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. each day on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays, and
 may not provide online game services to minors in any form at any other time. All online games must be connected to the real-name verification system
 of the NAPP for online games to prevent addiction, all online game users must use real and valid identity information to register their game accounts
 and log in to online games, and online games enterprises must not provide online game services in any form (including visitor experience mode) to users
 who have not registered and logged in with their real names. We currently do not charge users for game playing time. However, if we were to start
 charging for playing time, we may lose our players, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

                                                                             29
Table of Contents

        Furthermore, minors are prohibited from playing games exceeding a certain period of time per day or putting money into their accounts exceeding
 a certain amount. Online game operators are required to explore the manner to notify users of different ages about the online games based on various
 criteria, such as the games’ content and the amount of money anticipated to be used in the games, on the game’s download, registration and log-in pages
 in a prominent way. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to
 Online Games—Anti-addiction System and Protection of Minors.”

        Although we have implemented several measures and developed a detailed plan for system upgrade and are in the process of conducting various
 system upgrading works according to the requirements under the relevant laws and regulations, we may be nevertheless considered non-compliant if the
 regulators take a different view, or if our system is not fully upgraded by the end of the grace period, the length of which also remains uncertain at the
 discretion of the relevant government authorities. Should the relevant government authorities find us not satisfying the requirements, they may order us
 to rectify. In a severe case, our business license could be revoked, which may materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial
 condition.

        In addition, there can be no assurance that the PRC regulators would not promulgate new laws and regulations in the future to further limit
 minors’ access and exposure to videos, live broadcasting, audios and other content formats that we offer on our platform. The implementation of the
 existing and future laws and regulations may lead to a decrease in the number of minors in our user base and the playtime of minor users, thereby
 leading to a decrease in the minor users’ revenue contribution to our mobile game and other businesses, and may materially and adversely affect our
 results of operations and prospects.


 Our ability to generate revenues from our mobile games could suffer if China’s mobile games market does not develop as anticipated.
        The mobile games market in China has evolved rapidly in recent years, with developments such as the introduction of new business models, the
 development of player preferences, the increasing popularity of smartphones, market entry by new competitors and the adoption of new strategies by
 existing competitors. We expect each of these trends to continue, and we must continue to adapt our strategy to successfully compete in this market.
 There are numerous other technologies and business models in varying stages of development, such as portable tablet computers, cloud gaming and VR
 games involving new mobile technologies, which could render certain current technologies or applications obsolete. Accordingly, it is extremely
 difficult to accurately predict player acceptance and demand for our various existing and potential new mobile game offerings, and the future size,
 composition and growth of this market. Furthermore, given the limited history and rapidly evolving nature of the mobile games market, we cannot
 predict the price that players will be willing to pay for the virtual items in our mobile games or whether players will have concerns over security,
 reliability, cost and quality of service associated with mobile games. If market acceptance of our mobile games is different than anticipated, our ability
 to maintain or increase our revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected.


 Illegal game servers and acts of cheating by users of mobile games could harm our business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our
 results of operations.
       Several of our competitors have reported that certain third parties have misappropriated the source codes of their games and set up illegal game
 servers and let their customers play such games on illegal servers without paying for the game playing time. While we already have in place numerous
 internal control measures to protect the source codes of our games from being stolen and to address illegal server usage and, to date, our games have not
 to our knowledge experienced such usage, our preventive measures may not be effective. The misappropriation of our game server installation software
 and installation of illegal game servers could harm our business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

        In addition, acts of cheating by users of mobile games could lessen the popularity of our mobile games and adversely affect our reputation and our
 results of operations. There have been a number of incidents in previous years where users, through a variety of methods, were able to modify the rules
 of our mobile games. Although these users did not gain authorized access to our systems, they were able to modify the rules of our mobile games during
 gameplay in a manner that allowed them to cheat and disadvantage our other mobile game users, which often has the effect of causing players to stop
 playing the game and shortening the game’s lifecycle. Although we have taken a number of steps to deter our users from engaging in cheating when
 playing our mobile games, we cannot assure you that we or the third parties from whom we license some of our mobile games will be successful or
 timely in taking steps necessary to prevent users from modifying the rules of our mobile games.

                                                                             30
Table of Contents

       If we suspect a player of installing cheating programs on our mobile games, or of engaging in other types of unauthorized activities, we may
 freeze that player’s game account or even ban the player from logging on to our games and other products. Such activities to regulate the behavior of our
 users are essential to maintain a fair playing environment for our users. However, if any of our regulatory activities are found to be wrongly
 implemented, our users may institute legal proceedings against us for damages or claims. Our operation, business and financial performance may be
 materially and adversely affected as a result.


 If we fail to develop effective advertising products and systems or retain existing advertisers or attract new advertisers to advertise on our platform,
 or if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from the advertisers or advertising agencies in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of
 operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
        We generate a portion of our revenues from advertising. We enter into contracts with both advertisers and third-party advertising agencies, and the
 financial soundness of these customers may affect our collection of accounts receivable. We make a credit assessment of the advertiser and advertising
 agency to evaluate the collectability of the advertising service fees before entering into an advertising contract. However, we cannot assure you that we
 are or will be able to accurately assess the creditworthiness of each advertiser or advertising agency, and any inability of advertisers or advertising
 agencies to pay us in a timely manner may adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows.

        Our ability to generate and maintain our advertising revenues depends on a number of factors, including the maintenance and enhancement of our
 brand, the scale, engagement and loyalty of our users and the market competition on advertising prices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
 retain existing advertisers or advertising agencies or attract new ones. If we fail to retain and enhance our relationships with third-party advertising
 agencies or advertisers themselves, our business, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.


 We rely on third-party logistics services for our product delivery when performing our e-commerce business, and if such third-party logistics services
 fail to provide reliable logistics services, our e-commerce business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.
        We offer ACG-related and other types of merchandise on our platform, and generate revenues from sales of these products. Our e-commence
 business uses a number of third-party logistics companies to deliver our products to customers. Any interruption to or failure in logistics services could
 prevent the timely or proper delivery of our products. These interruptions may be due to events that are beyond our control or the control of these third-
 party logistics services, such as pandemic, inclement weather, natural disasters, transportation interruptions or labor unrest or shortage. We may not be
 able to find alternative logistics companies to provide logistics services in a timely and reliable manner, or at all, to replace such third-party logistics
 services to the extent necessary. If products sold on our platform are not delivered in proper condition or on a timely basis or at all, our e-commerce
 business and reputation would suffer.


 We rely upon our partner to deliver our services through smart TV.
        In smart TV video streaming market, only a small number of qualified license holders can provide internet audio and visual program service to the
 TV terminal users via smart TVs, set-top boxes and other electronic products. Most of those license holders are radio or TV stations. Private companies
 that wish to operate such business need to cooperate with those license holders to legally provide relevant services. We cooperate with a PRC licensed
 entity for the development of relevant programs and provision of audio-visual program services through private network and targeted communication
 channels, such as smart TVs. If we are not successful in maintaining existing or creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content
 licensing, regulatory or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to grow our business may
 be adversely impacted.

                                                                              31
Table of Contents

 Many of our products and services contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products and services
 in a manner that negatively affects our business.
       We use open source software in our products and services and will use open source software in the future. There is a risk that open source software
 licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products or
 services. Additionally, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative
 works that we developed using such software. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely
 available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement.
 This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully.

       Furthermore, because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual
 property rights with respect to such software source code may be limited or lost entirely. As a result, we may be unable to prevent our competitors or
 others from using such software source code contributed by us.


 We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing services that operate effectively
 with these operating systems, networks, devices and standards.
        We make our products and services available across a variety of operating systems, mainly on mobile devices and personal computers. As mobile
 usage accelerates, we expect to generate a large portion of our business and revenues from mobile. If we are unable to successfully capture and retain the
 growing number of users that access internet services through mobile devices, or if we are slower than our competitors in developing attractive products
 and services adaptable for mobile devices, we may fail to capture a significant share or an increasingly important portion of the market or may lose
 existing users. In addition, even if we are able to retain the increasing number of mobile users, we may not be able to continue to successfully
 commercialize mobile user traffic in the future.

       We depend on the interoperability of our products and services with popular devices, desktop and mobile operating systems and web browsers that
 we do not control, such as Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, and others. Any changes in devices or their systems that degrade the functionality of our
 products and services or give preferential treatment to competitive products or services could adversely affect usage of our products and services. We
 may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing services that operate effectively with
 these operating systems, networks, devices and standards. Further, if the number of systems, networks and devices for which we develop our products
 and services increases, it will result in an increase in our costs and expenses, and adversely affect our gross margin and results of operation.


 We face risks associated with our investments.
       We have made short-term and long-term investments. Our short-term investments primarily include money market funds, financial products with
 variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying assets issued by commercial banks or other financial institutions and publicly traded
 companies with the intention to be sold within twelve months. Our long-term investments primarily consist of investment in companies whose
 businesses are complementary to ours, including game, anime production and high-technology companies.

        These investments may earn yields substantially lower than anticipated and the fair value of our investments may fluctuate significantly, which
 contribute to the uncertainties in valuation. Any failure to realize the benefits we expected from these investments may materially and adversely affect
 our business and financial results. From time to time, we may also make alternative investments and enter into strategic partnerships or alliances as we
 see fit to expand our product offerings or business in other countries or regions, which may expose us to additional risks. Also see “—We face various
 challenges and risks in connection with our expansion into overseas markets.”

                                                                             32
Table of Contents

       Any change in securities prices and market conditions could lead to volatility in the fair value of our investments accounted for at fair value,
 which could further impact our financial condition and results of operations and may also impact our ability to dispose of these investments at favorable
 prices.


 Difficulties in identifying, consummating and integrating acquisitions and strategic alliances and potential impair in connection with our
 investments or acquisitions may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
       We have acquired, and may in the future acquire, companies that are complementary to our business. From time to time, we may also make
 alternative investments and enter into strategic partnerships or alliances as we see. For example, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire a
 controlling interests in Chaodian Inc. and entities controlled by it (collectively, “Chaodian”) in July 2019 and acquired the remaining interests in
 Chaodian in September 2020. Chaodian operates offline events, such as concerts and exhibitions Bilibili Macro Link and Bilibili World, and a talent
 agency that is currently managing many of our content creators. Chaodian has started to operate e-commerce and advertising business since the end of
 2020. In April 2020, we entered into a business collaboration agreement with Sony Corporation to pursue collaboration opportunities within the area of
 entertainment business in the Chinese market, including anime and mobile games. In November 2021, we acquired all of the equity interests in Beijing
 Siyuexingkong Network Technology Co., Ltd. (“Youyaoqi”), a comics distribution company, to enrich our content offerings.

       However, past and future acquisitions, partnerships or alliances may expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with:
       •      the integration of new operations and the retention of customers and personnel;
       •      significant volatility in our operating profit (loss) due to changes in the fair value of our contingent purchase consideration payable;
       •      unforeseen or hidden liabilities, including those associated with different business practices;
       •      the diversion of management’s attention and resources from our existing business and technology by acquisition, transition and integration
              activities;
       •      failure to achieve synergies with our existing business and generate revenues as anticipated;
       •      failure of the newly acquired businesses, technologies, services and products to perform as anticipated;
       •      inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset additional costs and expenses;
       •      breach or termination of key agreements by the counterparties;
       •      the costs of acquisitions;
       •      international operations conducted by some of our subsidiaries;
       •      any different interpretations on contingent purchase consideration; or
       •      the potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with both our employees and customers resulting from our integration of new businesses.

       Any of the potential risks listed above could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and our results of operation.
 In addition, we cannot be assured the acquired businesses, technologies, services and products from our past acquisitions and any potential transaction
 will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other potential unforeseen adverse effects on our business.

                                                                             33

 We may incur impairment charges for our intangible assets and goodwill.
        Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
 liabilities assumed from the acquired entity as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. We recorded goodwill
 of RMB1,295.8 million and RMB2,338.3 million (US$366.9 million) as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

       We are required to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be
 impaired. We may record impairment of goodwill acquired in connection with our acquisitions if the carrying value of our goodwill acquired in
 connection with our past or future acquisitions are determined to be impaired.

        Our intangible assets consist primarily of licensed copyrights of content, license rights of mobile games, and intellectual property and others.
 Purchased intangible assets are initially recognized and measured at fair value. Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions are recognized
 as assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion. Intangible assets are subsequently measured at
 cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets should be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
 indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. We cannot guarantee that we will not record greater impairment losses of
 intangible assets in the future. Material impairment of intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.


 Any malfunction, capacity constraint or operation interruption for any extended period may have an adverse impact on our business.
        Our ability to provide superior user experience on our platform depends on the continuous and reliable operation of our IT systems. We cannot
 assure you that we will be able to procure sufficient bandwidth in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to do so may significantly
 impair user experience on our platform and decrease the overall effectiveness of our platform to users, content providers and advertisers. Our IT systems
 and proprietary content distribution network are vulnerable to damage or interruption as a result of fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses,
 telecommunications failures, undetected errors in software, computer viruses, hacking and other attempts to harm our IT systems. Disruptions, failures,
 unscheduled service interruptions or a decrease in connection speeds could damage our reputation and cause our users, content providers and advertisers
 to migrate to our competitors’ platforms. If we experience frequent or persistent service disruptions, whether caused by failures of our own IT systems
 or those of third-party service providers, our user experience may be negatively affected, which in turn may have a material and adverse effect on our
 reputation and business. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in minimizing the frequency or duration of service interruptions. As the
 number of our users increases and our users generate more content on our platform, we may be required to expand and adapt our technology and
 infrastructure to reliably store and process content. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the performance of our platform,
 especially during peak usage times, as our services become more complex and our user traffic increases.


 Undetected programming errors or flaws or failure to maintain effective customer service could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance
 of our products and services, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
        The video programs on our platform may contain programming errors that may only become apparent after their release. We generally have been
 able to resolve such flaws and errors. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to detect and resolve all these programming errors effectively.
 Undetected programming errors could adversely affect our user experience and market acceptance.

       Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, errors, bugs or vulnerabilities. Any errors, bugs or vulnerabilities discovered in
 our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of content providers, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of
 which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

                                                                              34

 We utilize payment collection channels to collect proceeds from our paying users’ purchases. Any failure by those payment collection channels to
 process payments effectively and securely may materially and adversely affect our revenue realization and brand recognition.
       We depend on the billing and payment systems of third parties such as online third-party payment processors to maintain accurate records of
 payments of sales proceeds by paying users and collect such payments. We receive periodic statements from these third parties which indicate the
 aggregate amount of fees that were charged to paying users of our products and services. Our business and results of operations could be adversely
 affected if these third parties fail to accurately account for or calculate the revenues generated from the sales of our products and services. If there are
 security breaches or failure or errors in the payment process of these third parties, user experience may be affected and our business results may be
 negatively impacted.

        Failure to timely collect our receivables from third parties whose billing and payment systems we use and third-party payment processors may
 adversely affect our cash flows. Our third-party payment processors may from time to time experience cash flow difficulties. Consequently, they may
 delay their payments to us or fail to pay us at all. Any delay in payment or inability of current or potential third-party payment processors to pay us may
 significantly harm our cash flow and results of operations.

       We also do not have control over the security measures of our third-party payment service providers, and security breaches of the online payment
 systems that we use could expose us to litigation and possible liability for failing to secure confidential customer information and could, among other
 things, damage our reputation and the perceived security of all of the online payment systems that we use. If a well-publicized internet security breach
 were to occur, users concerned about the security of their online payments may become reluctant to purchase our products through payment service
 providers even if the publicized breach did not involve payment systems or methods used by us. In addition, billing software errors could damage user
 confidence in these payment systems. If any of the above were to occur and damage our reputation or the perceived security of the payment systems we
 use, we may lose paying users as they may be discouraged from purchasing products or services on our platform, which may have an adverse effect on
 our business and results of operations.


 Our success depends on the efforts of our key employees, including our senior management members and other technology personnel. If we fail to
 hire, retain and motivate our key employees, our business may suffer.
        We depend on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key employees, many of whom are difficult to replace. The loss of
 the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. Competition for qualified talent in China is intense,
 particularly in the internet and technology industries. Our future success depends on our ability to attract a large number of qualified employees and
 retain existing key employees. If we are unable to do so, our business and growth may be materially and adversely affected and the trading prices of our
 listed securities could suffer. Our need to significantly increase the number of our qualified employees and retain key employees may cause us to
 materially increase compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation.


 We have granted, and may continue to grant, options and other types of awards under our share incentive plan, which may result in increased
 share-based compensation expenses.
        We adopted a global share incentive plan in 2014 and a share incentive plan in 2018, which we refer to as the Global Share Plan and the 2018
 Plan, respectively, in this annual report, for the purpose of granting share-based compensation awards to employees, directors and consultants to
 incentivize their performance and align their interests with ours. We recognize expenses in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S.
 GAAP. Under each of the share incentive plans, we are authorized to grant options and other types of awards. As of February 28, 2022, awards to
 purchase 22,383,161 ordinary shares under both of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan have been granted and outstanding, excluding awards that
 were forfeited or cancelled after the relevant grant dates. We recognize share-based compensation expenses in our consolidated financial statements in
 connection with these grants, and may continue to incur such expenses in the future. As of December 31, 2021, our unrecognized share-based
 compensation expenses relating to unvested awards amounted to RMB4,497.6 million (US$705.8 million), adjusted for estimated forfeitures.

                                                                               35

 If we cannot obtain sufficient cash when we need it, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our convertible notes.
        In April 2019, we issued US$500 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026, which we refer to as April 2026
 Notes in this annual report. The April 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.375% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of
 each year, beginning on October 1, 2019, and will mature on April 1, 2026 (unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted). In June 2020, we issued
 US$800 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2027, which we refer to as 2027 Notes in this annual report. The 2027
 Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15,
 2020, and will mature on June 15, 2027 (unless repurchased, redeemed or converted). In November 2021, we issued US$1,600 million in aggregate
 principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026, which we refer to as December 2026 Notes in this annual report. The December 2026 Notes bear
 interest at a rate of 0.5% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2022, and will mature
 on December 1, 2026 (unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted). The April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes are collectively
 referred to as the Bilibili Convertible Notes in this annual report.

        Holders of the Bilibili Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on April 1, 2024, in the case of the April 2026
 Notes, June 15, 2023 and June 15, 2025, in the case of the 2027 Notes, and December 1, 2024, in the case of the December 2026 Notes. In addition, the
 Bilibili Convertible Notes each contains similar protections concerning the holders’ right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a
 fundamental change (as defined in the terms of such notes), as well as similar provisions regarding our ability to redeem the existing notes in case of
 certain changes in tax law. Each of the indentures for the Bilibili Convertible Notes defines a “fundamental change” to include, among other things,
 Bilibili’s ADSs ceasing to be listed on The New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or The NASDAQ Global Market. See
 “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The ADSs will be prohibited from trading in the United States
 under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully investigate auditors located
 in China, or in 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and
 adversely affect the value of your investment.” Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the Bilibili Convertible Notes will have the
 right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Bilibili Convertible Notes or any portion of the principal amount at a repurchase price equal
 to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In the event of a fundamental change, we may
 also be required to issue additional ADSs or, in the case of the December 2026 Notes, Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of ADSs if a holder of the
 December 2026 Notes so elects, upon conversion of the relevant Bilibili Convertible Notes. In addition, upon conversion of the December 2026 Notes,
 unless we elect to deliver solely ADSs (or Class Z ordinary shares if such holder elects to receive Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of any ADSs
 deliverable upon conversion) to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional ADS), we will be required to make
 cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. See also “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital
 Resources.”

        However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the notes
 surrendered therefor or redeem the notes or the notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes, redeem the notes or pay cash upon
 conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our and/or our subsidiaries’ current or future
 indebtedness. We derive most of our revenues from, and hold most of our assets through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we may rely in part upon
 distributions and advances from our subsidiaries in order to help us meet our payment obligations under the the Bilibili Convertible Notes and our other
 obligations. Our subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and do not have any obligation (legal or otherwise) to provide us with distributions or advances.
 We may face tax or other adverse consequences, or legal limitations, on our ability to obtain funds from these entities. In addition, our ability to obtain
 external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:
       •      our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;
       •      general market conditions for financing activities by internet companies; and

                                                                               36
Table of Contents

       •       economic, political and other conditions in the PRC and elsewhere.

       Our failure to repurchase the Bilibili Convertible Notes or pay the redemption price or repay the principal at a time when the repurchase or such
 payment is required by the respective indenture governing the notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes would constitute a
 default under the respective indenture governing the notes. A default under any of these indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a
 default under any of the other indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness or any future indebtedness. If the repayment of the existing notes or
 any other indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the existing notes
 or other indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.


 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may lose investor confidence in the reliability of our
 financial statements which in turn could negatively impact the trading price of our shares and/or ADSs or otherwise harm our reputation.
        The SEC, as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of
 management on the effectiveness of such companies’ internal control over financial reporting in their respective annual reports. In addition, an
 independent registered public accounting firm for a public company may be required to issue an attestation report on the effectiveness of such
 company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.
 Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting
 firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which
 our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, as we have
 become a public company, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems
 for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation.

       If we fail to implement and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our consolidated
 financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
 information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading prices of our listed
 securities. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and
 subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanction.


 We rely on certain key operating metrics to evaluate the performance of our business, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm
 our reputation and negatively affect our business.
       We rely on certain key operating metrics, such as MAUs and average monthly paying users, to evaluate the performance of our business. Our
 operating metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics used by other companies due to differences in
 methodology and assumptions. We calculate these operating metrics using internal company data that have not been independently verified. If we
 discover material inaccuracies in the operating metrics we use, or if they are perceived to be inaccurate, our reputation may be harmed and our
 evaluation methods and results may be impaired, which could negatively affect our business. If investors make investment decisions based on operating
 metrics we disclose that are inaccurate, we may also face potential lawsuits or disputes.


 We do not have any business insurance coverage.
       The insurance industry in China is still in an early stage of development, and insurance companies in China currently offer limited business-
 related insurance products. We do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain property
 insurance, product liability insurance or key-man insurance. We consider this practice to be reasonable in light of the nature of our business and the
 insurance products that are available in China and in line with the practices of other companies in the same industry of similar size in China. Any
 uninsured risks may result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
 condition.

                                                                                37

 We face various challenges and risks in connection with our expansion into overseas markets.
       As we expand our global and cross-border businesses into more overseas markets, we will face risks associated with expanding into markets in
 which we have limited or no experience and in which we may be less well-known. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of users, customers
 or business partners, fail to anticipate competitive conditions or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets. The expansion of our
 overseas and cross-border businesses will also expose us to risks inherent in operating businesses globally, including, but not limited to:
       •      inability to recruit international and local talent and deal with challenges in replicating or adapting our company policies and procedures to
              operating environments different than those of China;
       •      lack of acceptance of the product and service offerings on our platform;
       •      disruptions in the supply chain;
       •      investigations regarding anti-dumping;
       •      trade wars;
       •      geopolitical tensions, political instability and general economic or political conditions in particular countries or regions;
       •      challenges and increased expenses associated with staffing and managing global and cross-border operations and managing an organization
              spread over multiple jurisdictions;
       •      trade barriers, such as import and export restrictions, tariffs, customs duties and other taxes, competition law regimes and other trade
              restrictions, as well as other protectionist policies;
       •      differing and potentially adverse tax consequences;
       •      increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements;
       •      adaption to different industry practices;
       •      challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;
       •      the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other natural disasters;
       •      increased costs to protect the security and stability of our information technology systems, intellectual property and personal data,
              including compliance costs related to data localization laws;
       •      availability and reliability of global and cross-border payment systems and logistics infrastructure; and
       •      exchange rate fluctuations.

       As we expand further into new regions and markets, these risks could intensify, and efforts we make to expand our global and cross-border
 businesses and operations may not be successful. Failure to expand our global and cross-border businesses and operations could materially and
 adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

      Transactions conducted through our global and cross-border platforms may be subject to different customs, taxes and rules and regulations, and
 we may be adversely affected by the complexity of and developments in customs, foreign exchange and import/export laws, rules and regulations in
 China and other jurisdictions.

                                                                              38
Table of Contents

       In addition, changes to trade policies, treaties and tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or the perception that these changes could occur,
 could adversely affect our global and cross-border operations, our financial condition and results of operations.


 Heightened tensions in international relations, particularly between the United States and China, may adversely impact our business, financial
 condition, and results of operations.
        Recently there have been heightened tensions in international relations, particularly between the United States and China, but also as a result of
 the conflicts in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. These tensions have affected both diplomatic and economic ties between the two countries. Heightened
 tensions could reduce levels of trade, investments, technological exchanges, and other economic activities between the two major economies. The
 existing tensions and any further deterioration in the relationship between the United States and China may have a negative impact on the general,
 economic, political, and social conditions in both countries and, given our reliance on the Chinese market, adversely impact our business, financial
 condition, and results of operations.


 A severe or prolonged downturn in the Chinese or global economy, any financial or economic crisis, or perceived threat of such a crisis, could
 materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
        COVID-19 has had a severe and negative impact on the Chinese and the global economy since 2020. Whether this will lead to a prolonged
 downturn in the economy is still unknown. Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, the global macroeconomic environment was facing numerous
 challenges. The growth rate of the Chinese economy had already been slowing since 2010. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects
 of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies which had been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading
 economies, including the United States and China, even before 2021. The conflicts in Ukraine and the imposition of broad economic sanctions on
 Russia could raise energy prices and disrupt global markets. Unrest, terrorist threats and the potential for war in the Middle East and elsewhere may
 increase market volatility across the globe. There have also been concerns about the relationship between China and other countries, including the
 surrounding Asian countries, which may potentially have economic effects. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the future relationship
 between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Economic conditions in China are
 sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic
 growth rate in China. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may materially and adversely affect our business, results of
 operations and financial condition.


 We face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly disrupt
 our operations.
       In recent years, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in China and globally, including the outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020, the World
 Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of
 businesses and facilities in China and worldwide.

        The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions in the global economy. To contain the spread of
 COVID-19, the Chinese government has taken certain emergency measures, including extension of the Lunar New Year holidays, implementation of
 travel bans, blockade of certain roads and closure of factories and businesses, and encouragement of remote working arrangements and cancellation of
 public activities. Recently, there has been a recurrence of COVID-19 outbreaks in certain provinces of China, including Shanghai, due to the Delta and
 Omicron variants. As a result, the Chinese government has implemented similar emergency measures to contain further spread of COVID-19.

        As it has historically, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to, among other things, (i) disrupt our supply chain, delay our ability to timely fulfill
 our e-commerce orders and lead to higher fulfilment expenses, (ii) reduce or curtail our customers’ advertising expenditures and overall demand for our
 services, and increase the volatility of their advertising expenditure patterns from period-to-period, (iii) increase the volatility of the size and
 engagement of our active user base, and cause us to incur higher bandwidth costs, (iv) cause delays in production and uncertainty in scheduling of
 content of our licensed content providers, which may in turn hinder our user acquisition and user engagement level improvement efforts, and (v) the
 initiatives we put forth in response to COVID-19 and many other efforts to leverage our technology, products and services to help contain the pandemic,
 all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial
 Review and Prospects—Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations and Financial Performance.”

                                                                               39
Table of Contents

       We have reinstated remote working arrangements for our employees in affected regions, which could however reduce the capacity and efficiency
 of our operations and negatively impact the normal business operations. Our other measures taken to reduce the impact of this epidemic outbreak
 included upgrading our telecommuting system, monitoring our employees’ health on a daily basis and optimizing our technology system to support
 potential growth in user traffic. We continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from government and public health authorities and may take
 additional actions based on their recommendations.

       There remains uncertainty around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken, or may be taken, in response to
 the COVID-19 pandemic, which will depend on numerous factors, including, among others, the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 and its variants,
 hospitalization and mortality rates, and the availability and distribution of safe and effective treatments and vaccines.

        We are also vulnerable to natural disasters and other calamities. Although we have servers that are hosted in an offsite location and our backup
 system is able to capture data on a real-time basis, we may still be unable to recover certain data in the event of a server failure. We cannot assure you
 that any backup systems will be adequate to protect us from the effects of fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures,
 break-ins, war, riots, terrorist attacks or similar events. Any of the foregoing events may give rise to server interruptions, breakdowns, system failures,
 technology platform failures or internet failures, which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware as well as
 adversely affect our ability to provide services on our platform.

       Any future outbreak of contagious diseases, extreme unexpected bad weather or natural disasters would adversely affect our offline events and
 delivery of the merchandise sold on our platform. If there is a recurrence of an outbreak of certain contagious diseases or natural disasters, the offline
 events operated by us may be cancelled or delayed and the delivery of the merchandise sold on our platform may be delayed. Government advices
 regarding, or restrictions on holding offline events and travels, in the event of an outbreak of any contagious disease or occurrence of natural disasters
 may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.


 Our ability to conduct business in international markets may be adversely affected by legal, regulatory and other risks.
        International expansion of our platform and offerings is a part of our growth strategy and may subject us to additional risks and challenges,
 including but not limited to challenges in formulating effective local sales and marketing strategies targeting users from various jurisdictions and
 cultures, who have a diverse range of preferences and demands; challenges in achieving sufficient brand recognition as compared with our home market
 in China; challenges in identifying appropriate local business partners and establishing and maintaining good working relationships with them; exposure
 to different tax jurisdictions that may subject us to greater fluctuations in our effective tax rate and potentially adverse tax consequence; and risks of
 increased costs associated with doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including burdens of complying with a wide variety of local laws and regulations.
 If we fail to address any of these risks and challenges associated with our international expansion, our reputation, business and results of operations may
 be adversely affected.


 Any failure to comply with PRC property laws and relevant regulations regarding certain of our leased premises may materially and adversely affect
 our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
       We have not registered our lease agreements with the relevant government authorities. Under the relevant PRC laws and regulations, we may be
 required to register and file with the relevant government authority executed leases. The failure to register the lease agreements for our leased properties
 will not affect the validity of these lease agreements, but the competent housing authorities may order us to register the lease agreements in a prescribed
 period of time and impose a fine ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 for each non-registered lease if we fail to complete the registration within the
 prescribed timeframe.

                                                                              40

 Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
 If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our businesses in China do not comply with PRC
 regulations on foreign investment in internet and other related businesses, or if these regulations or their interpretation change in the future, we
 could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.
        PRC laws and regulations impose certain restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in internet and other related
 businesses, including the provision of internet content and online game operations. For example, the internet cultural business (except for music), the
 internet audio-visual program business, the radio and television program production and operation business, and the production of audio-visual products
 and/or electronic publications remain as prohibited areas for foreign investment. Specifically, foreign ownership of a commercial internet information
 services provider may not exceed 50%, and the major foreign investor is required to have a record of good performance and operating experience in
 managing value-added telecommunications business, however, such requirement of record of good performance and operating experience in managing
 value-added telecommunications business for the major foreign investor will be repealed by the Decision of the State Council on Revising and
 Repealing Certain Administrative Regulations, effective on May 1, 2022. We are a company registered in the Cayman Islands and our WFOE is
 considered a foreign-invested enterprise. To comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our business in China mainly through the VIEs and
 their respective subsidiaries, based on a series of contractual arrangements by and among our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China (our WFOEs), the
 VIEs, and their shareholders, as applicable. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we exert control over our consolidated affiliated entities and
 consolidate their financial results in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Our consolidated affiliated entities hold the licenses, approvals and key
 assets that are essential for our operations.

       In the opinion of our PRC counsel, based on its understanding of the relevant PRC laws and regulations, except as disclosed in this annual report,
 each of the contracts among our WFOEs, the VIEs and their shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms.

        However, Bilibili is a Cayman Islands holding company with no equity ownership in the VIEs and conducts its operations primarily through its
 PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their subsidiaries in China. Investors in Bilibili’s ADSs or the Class Z ordinary shares thus are not purchasing equity interest
 in the VIEs in China but instead are purchasing equity interest in a Cayman Islands holding company. If the PRC government deems that our contractual
 arrangements with the VIEs do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or
 the interpretation of existing regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to
 relinquish our interests in those operations. We may not be able to repay the notes and other indebtedness, and our shares may decline in value or
 become worthless, if we are unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the VIEs, which contribute to 74.5% of our revenues in
 2021. Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, and investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC government that could
 affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance of the VIEs and
 our company as a group.

        We have been further advised by our PRC counsel that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or
 future PRC laws and regulations. Thus, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would agree that our contractual arrangements comply with PRC
 licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. The
 PRC government may ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC counsel. If we are found in violation of any PRC laws or regulations or
 if the contractual arrangements among our WFOEs, the VIEs and their shareholders are determined as illegal or invalid by the PRC court, arbitral
 tribunal or regulatory authorities, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including, without
 limitation:
       •      revoking the business licenses and/or operating licenses of such entities;
       •      imposing fines on us;
       •      confiscating any of our income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations;
       •      discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations;

                                                                             41
Table of Contents

       •       placing restrictions on our right to collect revenues;
       •       shutting down our servers or blocking our app/websites;
       •       requiring us to restructure the operations in such a way as to compel us to establish a new enterprise, re-apply for the necessary licenses or
               relocate our businesses, staff and assets;
       •       imposing additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply; or
       •       taking other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business.

        The imposition of any of these penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business operations. In addition,
 if the imposition of any of these penalties causes us to lose the rights to direct the activities of our consolidated affiliated entities or the right to receive
 their economic benefits, we would no longer be able to consolidate their financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which would have a material
 adverse effect on our operations and result in the value of the securities diminishing substantially. Our shares may decline in value if we are unable to
 assert our contractual control rights over the assets of our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs that conduct all or substantially all of our operations. Bilibili, its
 PRC subsidiaries and VIEs and investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC government that could affect the
 enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance of the VIEs and our
 company as a group.

        Although we believe we, our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs comply with current PRC laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC
 government would agree that our contractual arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing
 policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. The PRC government has broad discretion in determining rectifiable or
 punitive measures for non-compliance with or violations of PRC laws and regulations. If the PRC government determines that we or the VIEs do not
 comply with applicable law, it could revoke the VIEs’ business and operating licenses, require the VIEs to discontinue or restrict the VIEs’ operations,
 restrict the VIEs’ right to collect revenues, block the VIEs’ websites, require the VIEs to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or
 requirements with which the VIEs may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on the VIEs’ business operations or on their customers, or take other
 regulatory or enforcement actions against the VIEs that could be harmful to their business. Any of these or similar occurrences could significantly
 disrupt our or the VIEs’ business operations or restrict the VIEs from conducting a substantial portion of their business operations, which could
 materially and adversely affect the VIEs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these occurrences results in our inability to
 direct the activities of any of the VIEs that most significantly impact its economic performance, and/or our failure to receive the economic benefits from
 any of the VIEs, we may not be able to consolidate these entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.


 We rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders for our operations in China, which may not be as effective in providing
 operational control as direct ownership.
        Due to PRC restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership of internet and other related businesses in China, we operate our business in China
 through the VIEs and their subsidiaries, in which we have no ownership interest. We rely on a series of contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their
 shareholders, as applicable, including the powers of attorney, to control and operate business of our consolidated affiliated entities. These contractual
 arrangements are intended to provide us with effective control over our consolidated affiliated entities and allow us to obtain economic benefits from
 them. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure” for more details about these contractual arrangements. In particular, our
 ability to control the consolidated affiliated entities depends on the powers of attorney, pursuant to which our WFOEs can vote on all matters requiring
 shareholder approval in the VIEs. We believe these powers of attorney are legally enforceable but may not be as effective as direct equity ownership.

                                                                                 42

        Although we have been advised by our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, that except as disclosed in this annual report, each of the contracts
 among our WFOEs, the VIEs and their shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable under existing PRC laws and regulations, these contractual
 arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the VIEs and their subsidiaries as direct ownership. If the VIEs or their shareholders fail
 to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may incur substantial costs and expend substantial resources to enforce
 our rights. These contractual arrangements are governed by and interpreted in accordance with PRC law, and disputes arising from these contractual
 arrangements will be resolved through arbitration in China. However, the legal system in China, particularly as it relates to arbitration proceedings, is
 not as developed as the legal system in many other jurisdictions, such as the United States. See “—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—
 Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us.” There are
 very few precedents and little official guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a VIE should be interpreted or enforced under PRC
 law. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of arbitration should legal action become necessary. These uncertainties
 could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In addition, arbitration awards are final and can only be enforced in PRC courts
 through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which could cause additional expenses and delays. In the event we are unable to enforce these
 contractual arrangements or we experience significant delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not
 be able to exert effective control over the VIEs and may lose control over the assets owned by the VIEs. As a result, we may be unable to consolidate the
 financial results of such entities in our consolidated financial statements, our ability to conduct our business and repay our indebtedness may be
 negatively affected, and our operations could be severely disrupted, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial
 condition.


 We may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by the VIEs and their subsidiaries that are important to our business if the VIEs and their
 subsidiaries declare bankruptcy or become subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.
        The VIEs hold certain licenses that are important to our operations, including the Value-added Telecommunication Business Licenses, License for
 Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, Online Culture Operating Permits and License for Production and Operation of Radio and Television
 Programs. Under our contractual arrangements, the shareholders of the VIEs may not voluntarily liquidate the VIEs or approve them to sell, transfer,
 mortgage or dispose of their assets or legal or beneficial interests exceeding certain threshold in the business in any manner without our prior consent.
 However, in the event that the shareholders breach this obligation and voluntarily liquidate the VIEs, or the VIEs declare bankruptcy, or all or part of
 their assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our operations, which could materially
 and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the VIEs or their subsidiaries undergo a voluntary or
 involuntary liquidation proceeding, their shareholders or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of its assets, hindering our ability
 to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


 Contractual arrangements we have entered into with the VIEs may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. A finding that we owe
 additional taxes could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment.
        Pursuant to applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by
 PRC tax authorities. We may be subject to adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements among our
 WFOE, the VIEs and their shareholders are not on an arm’s-length basis and therefore constitute favorable transfer pricing. As a result, the PRC tax
 authorities could require that the VIEs adjust their taxable income upward for PRC tax purposes. Such an adjustment could increase the VIEs’ tax
 expenses without reducing the tax expenses of our WFOE, subject the VIEs to late payment fees and other penalties for under-payment of taxes, and
 result in the loss of any preferential tax treatment our WFOE may have. As a result, our consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected.


 If the chops of our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries, are not kept safely, are stolen or are used by unauthorized persons or for
 unauthorized purposes, the corporate governance of these entities could be severely and adversely compromised.
       In China, a company chop or seal serves as the legal representation of the company towards third parties even when unaccompanied by a
 signature. Each legally registered company in China is required to maintain a company chop, which must be registered with the local Public Security
 Bureau. In addition to this mandatory company chop, companies may have several other chops which can be used for specific purposes. The chops of
 our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries are generally held securely by personnel designated or approved by us in accordance with our
 internal control procedures. To the extent those chops are not kept safe, are stolen or are used by unauthorized persons or for unauthorized purposes, the
 corporate governance of these entities could be severely and adversely compromised and those corporate entities may be bound to abide by the terms of
 any documents so chopped, even if they were chopped by an individual who lacked the requisite power and authority to do so.

                                                                              43
Table of Contents

 The shareholders of the VIEs may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business.
        The shareholders of the VIEs include Yi Xu, Rui Chen and Ni Li, who are also Bilibili’s shareholders, and, in some cases are Bilibili’s directors or
 officers. Conflicts of interest may arise between the roles of them as shareholders, directors or officers of Bilibili and as shareholders of the VIEs. For
 individuals who are also Bilibili’s directors and officers, we rely on them to abide by the laws of the Cayman Islands, which provide that directors and
 officers owe a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and in the best interest of Bilibili and not to use their positions for personal gain. The shareholders of
 the VIEs have executed powers of attorney to appoint our WFOEs or a person designated by our WFOEs to vote on their behalf and exercise voting
 rights as shareholders of the VIEs. We cannot assure you that when conflicts arise, these shareholders will act in the best interest of Bilibili or that
 conflicts will be resolved in our favor. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and these shareholders, we would have to
 rely on legal proceedings, which may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. There is also substantial uncertainty as to the
 outcome of any such legal proceedings.


 We may rely on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC
 subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and to pay dividends to our
 shareholders and ADS holders.
        Bilibili is a holding company, and we may rely on dividends to be paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements, including
 the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to the holders of the ADSs and our ordinary shares and service any debt we may incur.
 If our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or
 make other distributions to us.

       Under PRC laws and regulations, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China, such as Hode Shanghai, may pay dividends only out of its
 accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is
 required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years’ accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory
 reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
 Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability
 to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.


 Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to how the Foreign Investment Law may impact the viability of our current corporate structure and
 operations.
        The National People’s Congress approved the PRC Foreign Investment Law, or the 2019 FIL, on March 15, 2019, effective from January 1, 2020,
 and the State Council approved the Regulation on Implementing the PRC Foreign Investment Law, or the Implementation Regulations, on December 26,
 2019, effective from January 1, 2020, which replaced the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity
 Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together
 with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Supreme People’s Court of China issued a judicial interpretation on the 2019 FIL, in
 December 2019, effective from January 1, 2020, to ensure fair and efficient implementation of the 2019 FIL. The judicial interpretation clarifies the
 issues regarding the validity of the investment contract violating the restrictive or prohibitive requirements in the negative list. According to the judicial
 interpretation, courts in China shall not, among other things, support contracted parties to claim foreign investment contracts in sectors not on the
 Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2021 Version), most recently jointly promulgated by the Ministry of
 Commerce of the PRC, or the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC, or the NDRC, on December 27, 2021 and
 became effective on January 1, 2022, or the Negative List (2021), as void because the contracts have not been approved or registered by administrative
 authorities. However, since PRC judicial and administrative authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and
 contractual terms, it is difficult to predict the outcome of a judicial or administrative proceeding, and such unpredictability towards our contractual rights
 could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations. The 2019 FIL and Implementation Regulations embody an
 expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative
 efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments.

                                                                              44
Table of Contents

        The 2019 FIL removes all references to the terms of “de facto control” or “contractual control” as defined in the draft published in 2015 by
 MOFCOM. However, the 2019 FIL has a catch-all provision under the definition of “foreign investment” which includes investments made by foreign
 investors in China through means stipulated in laws or administrative regulations or other methods prescribed by the State Council. Therefore, the State
 Council may in the future promulgate laws and regulations that deem investments made by foreign investors through contractual arrangements as
 “foreign investment,” and our contractual arrangements may be subject to and be deemed to violate the market entry requirements in China. The “VIE”
 structure, or VIE structure, has been adopted by many PRC-based companies, including us, to obtain necessary licenses and permits in the industries that
 are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure” for more
 details about these contractual arrangements.

       In addition, the 2019 FIL further specifies that foreign investments shall be conducted in line with the “negative list” to be issued or approved to
 be issued by the State Council. The commercial internet information service, internet audio-visual program services, online cultural activities (except for
 music), the radio and television program production and operation business, and the production of audio-visual products and/or electronic publications
 that we conduct through our consolidated affiliated entities are subject to foreign investment restrictions set forth in the Negative List (2021). It is
 uncertain whether the industry of commercial internet information service, internet audio-visual program services, online culture activities (except for
 music), the radio and television program production and operation business, and the production of audio-visual products and/or electronic publications,
 in which the VIEs operate, will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions under the then updated “negative list” to be issued. If the
 then updated “negative list” requires companies with existing VIE structure like us to take further actions, we will face uncertainties as to whether any
 clearance from the relevant governmental authorities can be timely obtained, or at all.


 Divestitures of businesses and assets may have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
        We may engage partial or complete divestitures or other disposal transactions in connection with certain of our businesses and assets in the future,
 particularly ones that are not closely related to our core focus areas or might require excessive resources or financial capital, to help our company meet
 its objectives. These decisions are largely based on our management’s assessment of the business models and likelihood of success of these businesses.
 However, our judgment could be inaccurate, and we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits from these transactions. Our financial
 results could be adversely affected by the impact from the loss of earnings and corporate overhead contribution/allocation associated with divested
 businesses.

       Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through guarantees, indemnities or other financial
 obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future
 financial results. We may also be exposed to negative publicity as a result of the potential misconception that the divested business is still part of our
 consolidated group. On the other hand, we cannot assure you that the divesting business would not pursue opportunities to provide services to our
 competitors or other opportunities that would conflict with our interests. If any conflicts of interest that may arise between the divesting business and us
 cannot be resolved in our favor, our business, financial condition, results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

        Furthermore, reducing or eliminating our ownership interests in these businesses might negatively affect our operations, prospects, or long-term
 value. We may lose access to resources or know-how that would have been useful in the development of our own business. Our ability to diversify or
 expand our existing businesses or to move into new areas of business may be reduced, and we may have to modify our business strategy to focus more
 exclusively on areas of business where we already possess the necessary expertise. We may sell our interests too early, and thus forego gains that we
 otherwise would have received had we not sold. Selecting businesses to dispose of or spin off, finding buyers for them (or the equity interests in them to
 be sold) and negotiating prices for what may be relatively illiquid ownership interests with no easily ascertainable fair market value will also require
 significant attention from our management and may divert resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our
 business operations.

                                                                              45

        We have applied for, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has granted, a waiver from strict compliance with the requirements in Paragraph 3(b) of
 Practice Note 15 to the Hong Kong Listing Rules such that we are able to list a subsidiary entity on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange within three years
 of the Listing. While we currently do not have any plan with respect to any spin-off listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we may consider a
 spin-off listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for one or more of our businesses within the three-year period subsequent to the Listing. The waiver
 granted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is conditional upon us confirming to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in advance of any spin-off that would
 not render our company incapable of fulfilling the eligibility requirements under Rule 19C.05 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules based on the financial
 information of the entity or entities to be spun-off at the time of the Company’s Listing (calculated cumulatively if more than one entity is spun-off).


 Risks Related to Doing Business in China
 Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us.
       The PRC legal system is based on written statutes and court decisions have limited precedential value. The PRC legal system is evolving rapidly,
 and the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules may contain inconsistencies and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves
 uncertainties.

        From time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC judicial and
 administrative authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to predict
 the outcome of a judicial or administrative proceeding than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based, in part, on
 government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published in a timely manner, or at all, but which may have retroactive effect. As a result,
 we may not always be aware of any potential violation of these policies and rules. Such unpredictability towards our contractual, property (including
 intellectual property) and procedural rights could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.


 The PRC government’s significant oversight over our business operation could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value
 of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs.
       We conduct our business primarily in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. PRC government has significant
 oversight over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to advance regulatory
 and societal goals and policy positions. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries and we
 cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies that directly or indirectly affect our industry or require us to seek
 additional permission to continue our operations, which could result in a material adverse change in our operation and/or the value of our Class Z
 ordinary shares and the ADSs.


 The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the
 PCAOB to conduct inspections over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of such inspections.
        Our auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor of
 companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which
 the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Since our auditor is located in China, a
 jurisdiction where the PCAOB has been unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditor is not currently
 inspected by the PCAOB. As a result, we and investors in the ADSs are deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the
 PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting
 firm’s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could
 cause investors and potential investors in the ADSs to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our
 financial statements.

                                                                                46
Table of Contents

 The ADSs will be prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, in 2024 if
 the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully investigate auditors located in China, or in 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of
 the ADSs, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.
       The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was signed into law on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states if the SEC
 determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection for the PCAOB for three
 consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit our shares or ADSs from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the
 over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the
 PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. The
 PCAOB identified our auditor as one of the registered public accounting firms that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely.

        Whether the PCAOB will be able to conduct inspections of our auditor before the issuance of our financial statements on Form 20-F for the year
 ending December 31, 2023 which is due by April 30, 2024, or at all, is subject to substantial uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our,
 and our auditor’s, control. The prohibition of our ordinary shares and ADSs from trading in the United States would substantially impair your ability to
 sell or purchase the ADSs when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of
 the ADSs. Also, such a prohibition would significantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material
 adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects.

        On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the
 prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two. On February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill which contained, among
 other things, an identical provision. If this provision is enacted into law and the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the
 prohibitions under the HFCAA is reduced from three years to two, then our shares and ADSs could be prohibited from trading in the United States in
 2023.


 The approval of, or report and fillings with the CSRC or other PRC government authorities may be required in connection with our offshore
 offerings under PRC law, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such filing
 and report process.
       The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory
 agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic
 companies and controlled by PRC persons or entities to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s
 securities on an overseas stock exchange. The interpretation and application of the regulations remain unclear, and our offshore offerings may ultimately
 require approval of the CSRC. If the CSRC approval is required, it is uncertain whether we can or how long it will take us to obtain the approval and,
 even if we obtain such CSRC approval, the approval could be rescinded. Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining the CSRC approval for any of our
 offshore offerings, or a rescission of such approval if obtained by us, would subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory
 authorities, which could include fines and penalties on our operations in China, restrictions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends outside of
 China, and other forms of sanctions that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

                                                                              47

        On July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities issued Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance
 with the Law. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas
 listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal
 with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. As a follow-up, on December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued a draft of the
 Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, and a draft of
 Administration Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies for public comments. These draft measures
 propose to establish a new filing-based regime to regulate overseas offerings and listings by domestic companies. Specifically, an overseas offering and
 listing by a PRC company, whether directly or indirectly, an initial or follow-on offering, must be filed with the CSRC. The examination and
 determination of an indirect offering and listing will be conducted on a substance-over-form basis, and an offering and listing shall be deemed as a PRC
 company’s indirect overseas offering and listing if the issuer meets the following conditions: (i) any of the operating income, gross profit, total assets, or
 net assets of the PRC enterprise in the most recent fiscal year was more than 50% of the relevant line item in the issuer’s audited consolidated financial
 statement for that year; and (ii) senior management personnel responsible for business operations and management are mostly PRC citizens or are
 ordinarily resident in the PRC, and the principal place of business is in the PRC or carried out in the PRC. The issuer or its affiliated PRC entity, as the
 case may be, shall file with the CSRC for its initial public offering, follow-on offering and other equivalent offing activities. Particularly, the issuer shall
 submit the filing with respect to its initial public offering and listing within three business days after its initial filing of the listing application, and submit
 the filing with respect to its follow-on offering within three business days after the completion of the follow-on offering. Failure to comply with the
 filing requirements may result in fines to the relevant PRC companies, suspension of their businesses, revocation of their business licenses and operation
 permits and fines on the controlling shareholder and other responsible persons. Theses draft measures also set forth certain regulatory red lines for
 overseas offerings and listings by PRC enterprises. On April 2, 2022, the CSRC promulgated Provisions on Strengthening the Confidentiality and
 Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Issuance and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments), according to which, a domestic
 company that plans to, either directly or through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant entities or individuals including
 securities companies, securities service providers, and overseas regulators, documents and materials that contain state secrets or government work
 secrets, shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and file with the secrecy administrative department at the same level. A
 domestic company that plans to, either directly or through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant entities or individuals
 including securities companies, securities service providers, and overseas regulators, other documents and materials that, if divulged, will jeopardize
 national security or public interest, shall strictly fulfil relevant procedures stipulated by applicable national regulations. For more information, see “Item
 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to M&A and Overseas Listings.”

        There are substantial uncertainties as to whether these draft measures to regulate direct or indirect overseas offering and listing would be further
 amended, revised or updated, their enactment timetable and final content. As the CSRC may formulate and publish guidelines for filings in the future,
 the draft of Administration Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies for public comments does not
 provide for detailed requirements of the substance and form of the filing documents. In a Q&A released on its official website, the respondent CSRC
 official indicated that the proposed new filing requirement will start with new companies and the existing companies seeking to carry out activities like
 follow-on financing. As for the filings for the existing companies, the regulator will grant adequate transition period and apply separate arrangements.
 The Q&A also addressed the contractual arrangements and pointed out that if relevant domestic laws and regulations have been observed, companies
 with compliant VIE structure may seek overseas listing after completion of the CSRC filings. Nevertheless, it does not specify what qualify as compliant
 VIE structures and what relevant domestic laws and regulations are required to be complied with. The draft Provisions on Strengthening the
 Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Issuance and Listing by Domestic Enterprises does not provide for a clear scope of
 government work secrets or the documents and materials that, if divulged, will jeopardize national security or public interest, and the PRC government
 authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of the applicable laws. Given the substantial uncertainties surrounding the
 latest CSRC filing requirements at this stage, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the filings and fully comply with the relevant new
 rules on a timely basis, if at all.

                                                                                 48

        On December 27, 2021, the NDRC and the MOFCOM, jointly issued the Negative List (2021), which became effective on January 1, 2022.
 Pursuant to the Negative List (2021), if a domestic company engaging in the prohibited business stipulated in the Negative List (2021) seeks an overseas
 offering and listing, it shall obtain the approval from the competent governmental authorities. Besides, the foreign investors of the company shall not be
 involved in the company’s operation and management, and their shareholding percentages shall be subject, mutatis mutandis, to the relevant regulations
 on the domestic securities investments by foreign investors. At a press conference held on January 18, 2022, the NDRC clarified that the requirement as
 mentioned above would only apply to domestic company’s direct overseas offerings; as for the domestic company to list overseas indirectly, the CSRC
 is seeking public comments on the relevant regulations. As the Negative List (2021) is relatively new, there remain substantial uncertainties as to the
 interpretation and implementation of these new requirements, and it is unclear as to whether and to what extent listed companies like us will be subject
 to these new requirements. If we are required to comply with these requirements and fail to do so on a timely basis, if at all, our business operation,
 financial conditions and business prospect may be adversely and materially affected.

        In addition, we cannot assure you that any new rules or regulations promulgated in the future will not impose additional requirements on us. If it is
 determined in the future that approval and filing from the CSRC or other regulatory authorities or other procedures, including the cybersecurity review
 under the enacted versions of the draft measures, regulations and provisions described above, are required for our offshore offerings, it is uncertain
 whether we can or how long it will take us to obtain such approval or complete such filing procedures and any such approval or filing could be
 rescinded or rejected. Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining such approval or completing such filing procedures for our offshore offerings, or a
 rescission of any such approval or filing if obtained by us, would subject us to sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities for failure to
 seek CSRC approval or filing or other government authorization for our offshore offerings. These regulatory authorities may impose fines and penalties
 on our operations in China, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of China, limit our operating privileges in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of
 the proceeds from our offshore offerings into China or take other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
 results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our listed securities. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities also may take
 actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt our offshore offerings before settlement and delivery of the shares offered. Consequently, if
 investors engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to settlement and delivery, they do so at the risk that settlement and
 delivery may not occur. In addition, if the CSRC or other regulatory authorities later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their
 approvals or accomplish the required filing or other regulatory procedures for our prior offshore offerings, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such
 approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties or negative publicity regarding such approval
 requirement could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, reputation, and the trading price of our listed securities.


 We face uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy
 Sector and other anti-monopoly and competition laws and how it may impact our business operations.
        In February 2021, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector was promulgated by the Antimonopoly Commission
 of the PRC State Council. The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector is consistent with the Anti-Monopoly Law of PRC
 and prohibits monopoly agreements, abuse of dominant position and concentration of undertakings that may have the effect of eliminating or restricting
 competitions in the field of platform economy. More specifically, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector outlines
 certain practices that may, if without justifiable reasons, constitute abuse of dominant position, including without limitation, tailored pricing using big
 data and analytics, actions or arrangements seen as exclusivity arrangements, using technology means to block competitors’ interface, using bundled
 services to sell services or products, and compulsory collection of user data. Besides, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy
 Sector expressly states that concentration involving VIE will also be subject to antitrust filing requirements.

       In April 2021, the SAMR, together with certain other PRC government authorities convened an administrative guidance meeting, focusing on
 unfair competition acts in community group buying, self-inspection and rectification by major internet companies of possible violations of anti-
 monopoly, anti-unfair competition, tax and other related laws and regulations, and requesting such companies to comply with relevant laws and
 regulations strictly and be subject to public supervision. In addition, many internet companies, including over 30 companies which attended such
 administrative guidance meeting, are required to conduct a comprehensive self-inspection and make necessary rectification accordingly. The SAMR
 stated that it will organize and conduct inspections on the companies’ rectification results. If a company is found to conduct illegal activities, more
 severe penalties are expected to be imposed in accordance with the laws.

                                                                               49

       On August 17, 2021, the SAMR issued the Provisions on Preventing Unfair Online Competition (Draft for Comments), which detailed the
 implementation of the PRC Unfair Competition Law, including specifying certain online unfair competition behaviors that should be prohibited. As of
 the date of this annual report, Provisions on Preventing Unfair Online Competition (Draft for Comments) have not been formally adopted, and due to the
 lack of further clarification, there are still uncertainties regarding the interpretation and implementation of the provisions.

       Since the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector are relatively new and the Provisions on Preventing Unfair Online
 Competition (Draft for Comments) have not been formally adopted, uncertainties still exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. Although
 we do not believe we engage in any foregoing situations which would cause material adverse effect on our financial and business conditions, we cannot
 assure you that our business operations will comply with such regulation in all respects, and any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such
 regulation may result in governmental investigations, fines and/or other sanctions on us.


 Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the mobile and internet in China may adversely affect our business and subject us to
 liability for content posted on our platform.
        Internet companies in China are subject to a variety of existing and new rules, regulations, policies, and license and permit requirements on the
 distribution of information over the mobile and internet. Under these rules and regulations, content service providers are prohibited from posting or
 displaying over the mobile or internet content that, among others, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China or the public
 interest, is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory, or may be deemed by relevant government authorities as “socially destabilizing” or leaking
 “state secrets” of China. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to
 Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection.” In connection with enforcing these rules, regulations, policies and requirements, relevant
 government authorities may suspend services by, or revoke licenses of, any internet or mobile content service provider that is deemed to provide illicit
 content online or on mobile devices, and such activities may be intensified in connection with any ongoing government campaigns to eliminate
 prohibited content online. For example, in recent years, the National Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal Publications, the CAC, the MIIT, the MCT,
 and the MPS jointly have been launching a series of “Clean Up the Internet” campaigns. These campaigns aim to eliminate pornographic information
 and content in the internet information services industry by, among other things, holding liable individuals and corporate entities that facilitate the
 distribution of pornographic information and content. During the campaigns, relevant government authorities have shut down websites, removed links
 and closed accounts. Certain major public internet companies voluntarily initiated self-investigations to filter and remove content from their websites
 and cloud servers. In January 2019, CNSA issued the Regulations on Administration of Network Short Video Platforms and Censoring Criteria for
 Network Short Video Content, the latter of which was further amended in December 2021, to tighten the censorship on short video content. The
 regulatory authorities carried out a series of law enforcement actions against violation of personal information protection from January to December
 2019. On January 23, 2019, the OCCAC, the MIIT, the MPS, and the SAMR, jointly issued the Notice on Special Governance of Illegal Collection and
 Use of Personal Information via Apps, which restates the requirement of legal collection and use of personal information, encourages APP operators to
 conduct security certifications, and encourages search engines and APP stores to clearly mark and recommend those certified APPs. At the same time,
 they announced a one-year special crackdown on the illegal collection and misuse of personal information by apps. On July 22, 2020, the MIIT issued
 the Notice on Carrying out Special Rectification Actions in Depth against the Infringement on Users’ Rights and Interests by Apps to urge app service
 providers, among others, to strengthen the protection of users’ personal information in relation to the download and usage of apps. On March 12, 2021,
 the CAC, the MIIT, the MPS and the SAMR jointly issued the Necessary Personal Information Range Provisions of Common Types of Apps to further
 provide guidance over personal information security and privacy protection. As a result, a number of mobile apps were condemned publicly for their
 non-compliance with personal information protection policies, including, among other non-compliance actions, the failure to publish rules on the
 collection and improper use of users’ personal information, the failure to provide channels for users to access and revise their information, the failure to
 provide functions for users to cancel accounts, the unauthorized collection of personal information, the unreasonable requests for access, and the
 unauthorized sharing of information with third parties. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—
 Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business
 Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection.”

                                                                             50

       We endeavor to eliminate illicit content from our platform. We have made substantial investments in resources to monitor content that users post
 on our platform and the way in which our users engage with each other through our platform. In the past, we have terminated certain user accounts in
 order to eliminate spam, fictitious accounts and indecent content from our platform. We use a variety of methods to ensure our platform remains a
 healthy and positive experience for our users, including a designated content management team and our own data analytics software. Although we
 employ these methods to filter our users and content posted by our users, we cannot be sure that our internal content control efforts will be sufficient to
 remove all content that may be viewed as indecent or otherwise non-compliant with PRC law and regulations. Government standards and interpretations
 as to what constitutes illicit online content or behavior are subject to interpretation and may change.

        We have paid fines in connection with content posted on our platform, and government standards and interpretations may change in a manner that
 could render our current monitoring efforts insufficient. The PRC government has wide discretion in regulating online activities and, irrespective of our
 efforts to control the content on our platform, government campaigns and other actions to reduce illicit content and activities could subject us to negative
 press or regulatory challenges and sanctions, including imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of our licenses to operate in China or a ban of our
 platform, including closure of one or more parts of or our entire business. Further, our senior management could be held criminally liable if we are
 deemed to be profiting from illicit content on our platform. Although our operations have not been materially adversely affected by government
 campaigns or any other regulatory actions in the past, we cannot assure you that our business and operations will be immune from government actions
 or sanctions in the future. If government actions or sanctions are brought against us, or if there are widespread rumors that government actions or
 sanctions have been brought against us, our reputation could be harmed, we may lose users and other customers, our revenues and results of operation
 may be materially and adversely affected and the value of our securities could be dramatically reduced.

        In March 2018, the SAPPRFT issued the Notice on Further Regulating the Order of Online Audio-Visual Programs to further regulate the
 transmission of internet audio-visual programs. Due to the lack of clarification and detailed implementation rules, it is unclear to us whether and how
 this notice would be applicable to the content posted on our platform by our users. In November 2019, the CAC, the NRTA and the MCT, jointly issued
 the Notice on Promulgation of the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Information Services, which required the providers of internet
 audio-visual information services to have sufficient capacities to deal with cyber threats, prevent internet illegal and criminal activities, and defend the
 integrity, safety and availability of online data. We have conducted a review of the content that may be implicated on our platform and believe our
 current content monitoring measures in place are adequate. However, given the uncertainty in the interpretation and implementation of this notice, we
 may be required to subsequently implement further content monitoring measures, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
 condition and results of operations. For further information regarding this notice, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—
 Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”


 Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on overall economic growth in
 China, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
       A substantial majority of our revenues is sourced from China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are
 influenced by economic, political and legal developments in China. Economic reforms begun in the late 1970s have resulted in significant economic
 growth. However, any economic reform policies or measures in China may from time to time be modified or revised. China’s economy differs from the
 economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development,
 growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past years,
 growth has been uneven across different regions and among different economic sectors.

                                                                              51
Table of Contents

       The PRC government exercises significant oversight over China’s economic growth through strategically allocating resources, controlling the
 payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or
 companies. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in the past decade, that growth may not continue, as evidenced by the slowing of the
 growth of the PRC economy in the recent years. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the PRC government or in the
 laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect
 our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position.


 Currently there is no law or regulation specifically governing virtual asset property rights and therefore it is not clear what liabilities, if any, online
 game operators may have for virtual assets.
        While playing online games or participating on platform activities, our users acquire and accumulate some virtual assets, such as special
 equipment and other accessories. Such virtual assets can be important to online game players. In practice, virtual assets can be lost for various reasons,
 often through unauthorized use of the game account of one user by other users and occasionally through data loss caused by a delay of network service,
 a network crash or hacking activities. On May 28, 2020, the PRC Civil Code was enacted, effective on January 1, 2021, pursuant to which, ownership of
 data and virtual assets are civil rights protected by laws. However, there is currently no further PRC law or regulation specifically governing virtual asset
 property rights. As a result, there is uncertainty as to who the legal owner of virtual assets is, whether and how the ownership of virtual assets is
 protected by law, and whether an operator of online games such as us would have any liability to game players or other interested parties (whether in
 contract, tort or otherwise) for loss of such virtual assets. Based on several PRC court judgments, courts generally required the online game operators to
 provide well-developed security systems to protect virtual assets owned by players and some courts required game operators to return the virtual items
 or found game operators liable for the loss and damage incurred therefrom if the online game operators are found to be in default or violate players’
 rights. In case of a loss of virtual assets, we may be sued by our game players or users and held liable for damages, which may negatively affect our
 reputation and business, financial condition and results of operations.


 Restrictions on virtual currency may adversely affect our online game revenues.
        Our revenues from mobile games are collected through the online sale of in-game items, which are considered to be the “virtual currency” as such
 term is defined in the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Virtual Currency of Online Games, which was jointly issued by the Ministry of Culture
 of the PRC, or the MOC, the predecessor of the MCT, and MOFCOM in 2009. PRC laws and regulations, including this notice, have provided various
 restrictions on virtual currency and imposed various requirements and obligations on online game operators with respect to the virtual currency used in
 their games, including that (i) any entity engaged in the services relating to the issuance or trading of virtual currencies for online games shall comply
 with the conditions relevant to the establishment of an internet culture entity for business purpose and file an application with the provincial
 administrative department of culture at its locality for preliminary examination and then with the MOC for approval; (ii) the total amount of virtual
 currency issued by online game operators and the amount purchased by individual users in China is subject to limits, and online game operators are
 required to report the total amount of their issued virtual currency on a quarterly basis and are prohibited from issuing disproportionate amounts of
 virtual currency in order to generate revenues; (iii) virtual currency may only be provided to users in exchange for payment in legal currency and may
 only be used to pay for virtual goods and services of the issuer of the currency, and online game operators are required to keep transaction data records
 for no less than 180 days; (iv) online game operators are prohibited from providing lucky draws or lotteries that are conducted on the condition that
 participants contribute cash or virtual currency in exchange for game props or virtual currencies; (v) online game operators are prohibited from
 providing virtual currency trading services to minors; and (vi) companies involved with virtual currency in China must be either issuers or trading
 platforms, and may not operate simultaneously both as issuers and as trading platforms. We must tailor our business model carefully, including
 designing and operating our databases to maintain user information for the minimum required period, in order to comply with the current PRC laws and
 regulations, including the foregoing notices, in a manner that in many cases can be expected to result in an adverse impact on our online game revenues.

                                                                              52

 Advertisements shown on our platform may subject us to penalties and other administrative actions.
       Under PRC advertising laws and regulations, we are obligated to monitor the advertising content shown on our platform to ensure that such
 content is true and accurate and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, where a special government review is required for
 specific types of advertisements prior to internet posting, such as advertisements relating to pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals and
 veterinary pharmaceuticals, we are obligated to confirm that such review has been performed and approval has been obtained. Violation of these laws
 and regulations may subject us to penalties, including imposition of fines, confiscation of our advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the
 advertisements and orders to publish an announcement correcting the misleading information. In circumstances involving serious violations by us, PRC
 governmental authorities may force us to terminate our advertising operations or revoke our licenses.

       While we have made significant efforts to ensure that the advertisements shown on our platform are in full compliance with applicable PRC laws
 and regulations, we cannot assure you that all the content contained in such advertisements is true and accurate as required by the advertising laws and
 regulations, especially given the uncertainty in the interpretation of these PRC laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of applicable PRC
 advertising laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties and our reputation may be harmed, which may have an adverse effect on our business,
 financial condition, results of operations and prospects.


 If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to
 us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.
        Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a “de
 facto management body” within the PRC is considered a PRC resident enterprise. The implementation rules define the term “de facto management
 body” as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management of the business, productions, personnel, accounts and
 properties of an enterprise. In 2009, the STA issued the Circular Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises
 as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies which was most recently amended in December 2017, or the Circular
 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated
 offshore is located in China. The STA issued Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises Income Tax Regulation, or the Bulletin 45,
 which took effect on September 1, 2011 and was most recently amended on June 15, 2018, to provide more guidance on the implementation of Circular
 82 and clarify the reporting and filing obligations of Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated resident enterprises. Bulletin 45 also provides procedures
 and administrative details for the determination of resident status and administration of post-determination matters. Although Circular 82 only applies to
 offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners like us, the criteria
 set forth in the circular may reflect the STA’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax
 resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC
 enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident enterprise by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to
 PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) senior management and core management
 departments in charge of its daily operations function have their presence mainly in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial matters
 (such as loan, financing, financial risk management, etc.) and human resource matters (such as appointment, dismissal and remuneration, etc.) are made
 or are subject to determination or approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records,
 company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior
 executives habitually reside in the PRC.

        We believe that none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an
 enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto
 management body.” If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we will be subject to
 the enterprise income tax on our global income at the rate of 25% and we will be required to comply with PRC enterprise income tax reporting
 obligations. In addition, we may be required to withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident
 enterprises, including the holders of the ADSs. In addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) may be subject to PRC tax
 at a rate of 10% on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within the
 PRC. Furthermore, if PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, dividends paid to our
 non-PRC individual shareholders (including the ADS holders) and any gain realized on the transfer of the ADSs or ordinary shares by such holders may
 be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20% (which, in the case of dividends, may be withheld at source by us), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC
 sources. These rates may be reduced by applicable tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a
 PRC resident enterprise, but it is unclear whether our non-PRC shareholders would be able to obtain the benefits of any tax treaties between their
 country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your
 investment in our securities.

                                                                             53

 There are significant uncertainties under the EIT Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiaries, and dividends payable by
 our PRC subsidiaries to our offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain treaty benefits.
       Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, the profits of a foreign-invested enterprise generated through operations, which are distributed to
 its immediate holding company outside China, will be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%. Pursuant to a special arrangement between Hong Kong
 and China, such rate may be reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in the PRC company. Our
 current PRC subsidiaries are wholly owned by our Hong Kong subsidiaries, such as Hode HK. Accordingly, Hode HK may qualify for a 5% tax rate in
 respect of distributions from its PRC subsidiaries. Under the Notice of the State Taxation Administration on Issues regarding the Administration of the
 Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated in 2009, the taxpayer needs to satisfy certain conditions to enjoy the benefits under a tax treaty. These
 conditions include, but are not limited to: (i) the taxpayer must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends, and (ii) the corporate shareholder to
 receive dividends from the PRC subsidiaries must have met the direct ownership thresholds during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of
 the dividends. Further, the STA promulgated the Announcement of the Certain Issues with Respect to the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties in 2018,
 which sets forth certain detailed factors in determining “beneficial owner” status, and specifically, if an applicant’s business activities do not constitute
 substantive business activities, the applicant will not qualify as a “beneficial owner.”

        Entitlement to a lower tax rate on dividends according to tax treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of
 other countries or regions is subject to the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties promulgated
 by the STA on October 14, 2019 and became effective from January 1, 2020, which provides that non-resident enterprises are not required to obtain
 pre-approval from the relevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax. Instead, non-resident enterprises and their withholding agents
 may, by self-assessment and on confirmation that the prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met, directly apply the reduced withholding
 tax rate, collect and retain relevant materials for reference in accordance with these treaties and accept supervision and management from the tax
 authorities. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be entitled to any preferential withholding tax rate under tax treaties for dividends received
 from our PRC subsidiaries.


 We face uncertainty with respect to the indirect transfer of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.
      We face uncertainties regarding the reporting on and consequences of previous private equity financing transactions involving the transfer and
 exchange of shares in Bilibili by non-resident investors.

        In February 2015, the STA issued the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident
 Enterprises, or STA Bulletin 7, as amended in 2017. Pursuant to this bulletin, an “indirect transfer” of assets, including equity interests in a PRC resident
 enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if such arrangement does not
 have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains
 derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. According to STA Bulletin 7, “PRC taxable assets” include assets
 attributed to an establishment in China, immovable properties located in China, and equity investments in PRC resident enterprises, in respect of which
 gains from their transfer by a direct holder, being a non-PRC resident enterprise, would be subject to PRC enterprise income taxes. When determining
 whether there is a “reasonable commercial purpose” of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include: whether the main
 value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise
 mainly consist of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income mainly derives from China; whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries
 directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure; the duration
 of existence of the shareholders, the business model and organizational structure of the offshore enterprise; the replicability of the transaction by direct
 transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the offshore tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In respect of an
 indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain is to be included with the enterprise income tax filing of the PRC
 establishment or place of business being transferred, and would consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the
 underlying transfer relates to the immovable properties located in China or to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a
 PRC establishment or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax of 10% would apply, subject to available preferential
 tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements, and the party who is obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding
 obligation. Where the payer fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor is required to declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself
 within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. STA Bulletin 7 does not apply to
 transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired from a transaction through a public stock
 exchange.

                                                                              54

       There is uncertainty as to the application of STA Bulletin 7. We face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and
 future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries or investments.
 Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our company is transferor in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding
 obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions under STA Bulletin 7. For transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC
 resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under STA Bulletin 7. As a result, we may be required to expend
 valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these
 circulars, or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
 and results of operations.


 Discontinuation of any of the preferential tax treatments available to us or imposition of any additional taxes could adversely affect our financial
 condition and results of operations.
        The EIT Law and its implementation rules, effective 2008, unified the previously existing separate income tax laws for domestic enterprises and
 FIEs and adopted a unified 25% enterprise income tax, or the EIT, rate applicable to all resident enterprises in China, subject to certain exceptions. In
 addition, certain enterprises may enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 15% under the EIT Law if they qualify as High and New Technology Enterprise, or
 HNTE, subject to various qualification criteria. For example, in 2017, Hode Information Technology qualified as a HNTE and was eligible for a 15%
 preferential tax rate effective for three years starting from 2017 to 2019. Hode Information Technology has renewed this qualification which allows it to
 enjoy a 15% preferential EIT rate for another three years starting from 2020 to 2022. In addition, in 2018, Shanghai Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd.
 qualified as a HNTE which allows it to enjoy a three-year preferential EIT rate of 15% from 2018. Shanghai Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd. has renewed
 this qualification which allows it to enjoy a 15% preferential EIT rate for another three years starting from 2021 to 2023. If Hode Information
 Technology or Shanghai Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd. fails to maintain or renew their HNTE status, their applicable EIT rate may be increased to 25%,
 which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


 There are uncertainties with respect to value-added tax rates relating to the tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiaries.
        The MOF, the STA and the General Administration of Customs promulgated the Notice On Relevant Policies for Deepening Value Added Tax
 Reform on March 20, 2019, which provides that the value-added tax rate of 16% in manufacturing and other industries is reduced to 13%, the value-
 added tax rate of 10% in transportation and other industries is reduced to 9%, and the value-added tax rate in value-added telecommunication service
 and other industries stays at 6% from April 1, 2019. We are subject to value-added tax for goods sold at a rate varying from 0% to 16% depending on
 their categories in different periods in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Our advertising and marketing revenues (value-added tax included) are subject to culture
 business construction fee at a rate of 3% in the first half year of 2019, which was reduced to 1.5% since July 1, 2019, valid until December 31, 2024.
 The cultural business construction fees were exempted for the fiscal years of 2020 and 2021 as part of the measures taken by the government to ease the
 negative impact from COVID-19 pandemic. We are also subject to surcharges on value-added tax payments in accordance with PRC law. Starting from
 September 1, 2021, we are no longer legally required to withhold surcharges on value-added tax withheld for non-trade foreign exchange payments.
 However, it is uncertain whether the value-added tax rate will be raised or any of the abovementioned tax treatments will be altered in the future, which
 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject
 to sanctions including corrective orders, imposition of fines and confiscation of illegal gains.

                                                                            55

 It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China.
        Shareholder claims or regulatory investigations that are common in the United States (including securities law class actions and fraud claims)
 generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to
 providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a
 regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and
 administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of a mutual and
 practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March
 2020, no overseas securities regulator may directly conduct investigations or collect evidence and no entities or individuals may provide documents or
 materials in connection with securities activities without proper authorization as stipulated under Article 177. While detailed interpretation of or
 implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability of an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigations or
 collect evidence within China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests. See also “—Our shareholders may face
 difficulties in protecting their interests, and the ability to protect their rights through U.S. and Hong Kong courts may be limited, because we are
 incorporated under Cayman Islands law.” for risks associated with investing us as a Cayman Islands exempted company.


 China’s M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign investors,
 which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.
         The M&A Rules, and other recently adopted regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and
 requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M&A Rules
 require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic
 enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security, or
 (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover,
 the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, or the SCNPC, effective in August 2008 and
 the Provisions of the State Council on the Thresholds for Declaring Concentration of Business Operators, as amended in 2018, require that transactions
 which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds (meaning during the previous fiscal year, (i) the total global
 turnover of all operators participating in the transaction exceeds RMB10 billion and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than
 RMB400 million within China, or (ii) the total turnover within China of all the operators participating in the concentration exceeded RMB2 billion, and
 at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than RMB400 million within China) must be cleared by anti-monopoly law enforcement
 agency of the State Council before they can be completed. On December 14, 2020, the SAMR announced three cases of administrative penalties for the
 failures of acquirers to make proper concentration declarations to authorities about their past acquisitions. This is also the first time that the SAMR
 imposed administrative penalties for illegal concentration declarations on entities structured in a VIE arrangement.

                                                                             56
Table of Contents

        In addition, in 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and
 Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, also known as Circular 6, which officially established a security review system for mergers
 and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Further, MOFCOM promulgated the Regulations on Implementation of Security Review
 System for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, effective in September 2011, to implement Circular 6. Under
 Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having “national defense and security” concerns and mergers
 and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire the “de facto control” of domestic enterprises with “national security” concerns. Under the
 foregoing MOFCOM regulations, MOFCOM will focus on the substance and actual impact of the transaction when deciding whether a specific merger
 or acquisition is subject to security review. If MOFCOM decides that a specific merger or acquisition is subject to a security review, it will submit it to
 the Inter-Ministerial Panel, an authority established under Circular 6 led by the NDRC, and MOFCOM under the leadership of the State Council, to
 carry out security review. The regulations prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review by structuring transactions through trusts,
 indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. There is no explicit provision or official
 interpretation stating that the merging or acquisition of a company engaged in the internet content or mobile games business requires security review,
 and there is no requirement that acquisitions completed prior to the promulgation of the Security Review Circular are subject to MOFCOM review. On
 December 19, 2020, the NDRC and the MOFCOM jointly promulgated the Measures on the Security Review of Foreign Investment, effective on
 January 18, 2021, setting forth provisions concerning the security review mechanism on foreign investment, including the types of investments subject
 to review, review scopes and procedures, among others. The Office of the Working Mechanism of the Security Review of Foreign Investment, or the
 Office of the Working Mechanism, will be established under the NDRC, who will lead the task together with the MOFCOM. Foreign investor or
 relevant parties in China must declare the security review to the Office of the Working Mechanism prior to the investments in, among other industries,
 important cultural products and services, important information technology and internet products and services, important financial services, key
 technologies and other important fields relating to national security, and obtain control in the target enterprise. See “Item 4. Information on the Company
 —B. Business Overview—Regulation— Regulations Related to Foreign Investment in the PRC.”

       In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned
 regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining
 approval from MOFCOM or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. It is unclear whether our business
 would be deemed to be in an industry that raises “national defense and security” or “national security” concerns. However, MOFCOM or other
 government agencies may publish explanations in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security review, in which case
 our future acquisitions in China, including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements with target entities, may be closely scrutinized
 or prohibited.


 PRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered
 capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us to liability and penalties under PRC law.
        The State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or the SAFE, promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign
 Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or the
 SAFE Circular 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or
 control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update
 their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including
 change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or
 mergers or divisions. According to the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Policies for the Foreign Exchange Administration of Direct
 Investment released in February 2015 by SAFE, as amended in December 2019, or SAFE Circular 13, local banks will examine and handle foreign
 exchange registration for overseas direct investment, including the initial foreign exchange registration and amendment registration, under SAFE
 Circular 37 from June 2015.

       If our shareholders who are PRC residents or entities do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches or local banks, our PRC
 subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and we may
 be restricted in our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration described
 above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.

                                                                             57
Table of Contents

        Rui Chen, Yi Xu and Ni Li have completed initial SAFE registration prior to our initial public offering in 2018 and will update their registration
 filings with SAFE under SAFE Circular 37 when any changes should be registered under SAFE Circular 37. However, we may not at all times be fully
 aware or informed of the identities of all our shareholders or beneficial owners that are required to make or update such registrations, and we cannot
 compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE registration requirements. As a result, we cannot assure you that all of our shareholders or
 beneficial owners who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals
 required by, SAFE regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations or failure by us to amend the foreign
 exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities,
 limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and
 prospects.


 Failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock ownership plans or share option plans may
 subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.
        Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly listed companies due to their
 position as director, senior management or employees of the PRC subsidiaries of the overseas companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local
 branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. Our directors, executive officers and other employees
 who are PRC residents and who have been granted options could follow SAFE Circular 37 to apply for the foreign exchange registration before Bilibili
 became an overseas listed company. In 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic
 Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies. Under the notices and other relevant rules and regulations,
 PRC residents who participate in stock incentive plan in an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with SAFE or its local branches and
 complete certain other procedures. Participants of a stock incentive plan who are PRC residents must retain a qualified PRC agent, which could be a
 PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by such PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE
 registration and other procedures with respect to the stock incentive plan on behalf of its participants. Such participants must also retain an overseas
 entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of stock options, the purchase and sale of corresponding shares or interests and
 fund transfers. In addition, the PRC agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any material
 change to the stock incentive plan, the PRC agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. Failure of our PRC stock option holders
 to complete their SAFE registrations may subject these PRC residents to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional
 capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary’s ability to distribute dividends to us, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.
 The STA has issued certain circulars concerning equity incentive awards. Under these circulars, our employees working in China who exercise share
 options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Each of our PRC subsidiaries has obligations to file documents
 related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes for those employees. If our
 employees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations, we may face sanctions imposed by the tax
 authorities or other PRC governmental authorities.


 PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion
 may restrict or prevent us from using the proceeds of the offering of equity securities and notes to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs
 and their subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.
       Bilibili is an offshore holding company conducting its operations in China through PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their subsidiaries. Bilibili may
 make loans to its PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their subsidiaries, or it may make additional capital contributions to its PRC subsidiaries, establish new
 PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, or acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in an
 offshore transaction.

        Most of these ways are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example, loans by us to our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries to finance their
 activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of SAFE. If we decide to finance our wholly owned PRC
 subsidiaries by means of capital contributions, these capital contributions are subject to the requirement of making necessary filings in the Foreign
 Investment Comprehensive Management Information System and registration with other governmental authorities in China. Due to the restrictions
 imposed on loans in foreign currencies extended to any PRC domestic companies, we are not likely to make such loans to our consolidated affiliated
 entities, which are PRC domestic company. Further, we are not likely to finance the activities of our consolidated affiliated entities by means of capital
 contributions due to regulatory restrictions relating to foreign investment in PRC domestic enterprises engaged in internet information services, online
 games, online audio-visual program services and related businesses.

                                                                             58

        SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement
 of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, effective June 2015, in replacement of the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues
 Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises.
 According to SAFE Circular 19, the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-
 invested company is regulated such that RMB capital may not be used for the issuance of RMB entrusted loans, the repayment of inter-enterprise loans
 or the repayment of banks loans that have been transferred to a third-party. Although SAFE Circular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign
 currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within China, it also reiterates the principle
 that RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes
 beyond its business scope. Thus, it is unclear whether SAFE will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in China in actual practice. SAFE
 promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement
 Management Policy of Capital Account, or SAFE Circular 16, effective on June 9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular
 19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested
 company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to non-associated enterprises. Violations of SAFE
 Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to
 transfer any foreign currency we hold, including the net proceeds from our equity offering and notes offering and then to our PRC subsidiaries, which
 may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in China. On October 23, 2019, SAFE issued Notice of the State
 Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the Circular 28. Circular 28 allows
 non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to use their capital funds to make equity investments in China, provided that such investments do not
 violate the Negative List (2020) and the target investment projects are genuine and in compliance with PRC laws. Since Circular 28 was issued only
 recently, its interpretation and implementation in practice are still subject to substantial uncertainties. According to the Circular on Optimizing the
 Administration of Foreign Exchange to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business issued by the SAFE on April 10, 2020, eligible enterprises
 are allowed to make domestic payments using the income under their capital accounts generated from their capital, foreign debt and overseas listing,
 without providing materials evidencing the authenticity in advance, provided that the capital usage is authentic and compliant with the current capital
 account income usage management regulations. The concerned bank is required to conduct spot checks in accordance with the relevant requirements.

        In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies,
 we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely
 basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to our PRC subsidiary or with respect to future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we
 fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we received from our equity offering and notes offering and
 to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability
 to fund and expand our business.


 Fluctuation in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.
       The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People’s Bank of China. The Renminbi has
 fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. The value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected
 by changes in China’s political and economic conditions and by China’s foreign exchange policies, among other things. We cannot assure you that
 Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC
 or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.

                                                                              59
Table of Contents

        A substantial majority of our revenues and costs is denominated in RMB. Any significant depreciation of the RMB may materially adversely
 affect the value of, and any dividends payable on, the ADSs in U.S. dollars. For example, when we convert our U.S. dollars denominated funds into
 Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would
 receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on
 our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the
 U.S. dollar amount available to us. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to U.S. dollars would affect our
 financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms regardless of any underlying change in our business or results of operations.

        Very limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any
 hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in
 the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In
 addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign
 currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment.


 Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.
        The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of
 currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, Bilibili, a Cayman Islands
 holding company, primarily relies on dividend payments from its PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements it may have. Under
 existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-
 related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural
 requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC
 subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends to Bilibili. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is
 required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans
 denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval or registration to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC
 subsidiaries and VIEs to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital
 expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi.

        In light of the flood of capital outflows of China in 2016 due to the weakening RMB, the PRC government has imposed more restrictive foreign
 exchange policies and stepped up scrutiny of major outbound capital movement including overseas direct investment. More restrictions and substantial
 vetting process are put in place by SAFE to regulate cross-border transactions falling under the capital account. If any of our shareholders regulated by
 such policies fails to satisfy the applicable overseas direct investment filing or approval requirement timely or at all, it may be subject to penalties from
 the relevant PRC authorities. The PRC government may at its discretion further restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account
 transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we
 may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of the ADSs.


 Risks Related to Our Listed Securities
 The trading prices of our listed securities have been and are likely to continue to be volatile, regardless of our operating performance, which could
 result in substantial losses to our investors.
        The trading prices of our listed securities have been and are likely to continue to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to a variety of
 factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, the trading price of the ADSs has ranged from US$41.76 to US$157.66 per ADS in 2021,
 and the trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares has ranged from HK$328.2 to HK$1,052.0 per share in 2021. The trading price of our listed
 securities are likely to remain volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. This may happen because of broad market and
 industry factors, including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with operations located mainly in China that have
 listed their securities in the United States and/or Hong Kong. In addition to market and industry factors, the prices and trading volumes for our listed
 securities may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations, including the following:

                                                                               60

        •     announcements of new product and service offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;

              other equity related securities;
        •     sales of additional ADSs or other equity-related securities in the public markets, or issuance of ADSs upon conversion of convertible
              senior notes issued by us, or the perception of these events; and
        •     actual or potential litigation or regulatory investigations.


 We adopt different practices as to certain matters as compared with many other companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
        We completed our public offering in Hong Kong in March 2021 and the trading of our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
 commenced on March 29, 2021 under the stock code “9626.” As a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange pursuant to Chapter 19C of the
 Hong Kong Listing Rules, we are not subject to certain provisions of the Hong Kong Listing Rules pursuant to Rule 19C.11, including, among others,
 rules on notifiable transactions, connected transactions, share option schemes, content of financial statements as well as certain other continuing
 obligations. In addition, in connection with the Listing, we have applied for, and been granted with, a number of waivers and/or exemptions from strict
 compliance with the Hong Kong Listing Rules, the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, the Takeovers Codes and the
 SFO. As a result, we currently adopt different practices as to those matters as compared with other companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
 that do not enjoy those exemptions or waivers.

       Furthermore, if 55% or more of the total worldwide trading volume, by dollar value, of our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs over our most
 recent fiscal year takes place on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will regard us as having a dual primary listing in
 Hong Kong and we will no longer enjoy certain exemptions or waivers from strict compliance with the requirements under the Hong Kong Listing
 Rules, the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, the Takeovers Codes and the SFO, which could result in us having to
 amend our corporate structure and memorandum and articles of association and we may incur of incremental compliance costs.

       In March 2022, our board of directors approved a motion to pursue the voluntary conversion to dual-primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock
 Exchange (the “Primary Conversion”), and authorized our senior management to proceed with the relevant preparatory work and undertake the
 necessary procedures to complete the Primary Conversion. After the Primary Conversion, we will remain as a dual-listing company on the Hong Kong
 Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Global Select Market, and our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs will continue to be traded in both stock exchanges (as the
 case may be) and remain mutually fungible. The Primary Conversion is conditional upon and subject to, among other things, market conditions, further
 approval of our board of directors, and the obtaining of the necessary regulatory approvals, and we cannot assure you that we can obtain the relevant
 approvals.

                                                                             61

 Sales or perceived potential sales of our Class Z ordinary shares, ADSs, or other equity or equity-linked securities in the public market could cause
 the price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs to decline.
        Sales, either directly or in connection with derivative or other financial arrangements, of our Class Z ordinary shares, ADSs, or other equity or
 equity-linked securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may cause the market price of our Class Z ordinary shares
 and/or ADSs to decline significantly. All of our Class Z ordinary shares represented by ADSs were freely transferable by persons other than our
 affiliates without restriction or additional registration under the U.S. Securities Act. The Class Z ordinary shares held by our affiliates are also available
 for sale, subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable under Rule 144 of the U.S. Securities Act, under trading plans adopted pursuant to Rule
 10b5-1 or otherwise.

       Furthermore, although all of our directors and executive officers have agreed to a lock-up of their Class Z ordinary shares, any major disposal of
 our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs by any of them upon expiration of the relevant lock-up periods (or the perception that these disposals may
 occur upon the expiration of the lock-up period) may cause the prevailing market price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs to fall which could
 negatively impact our ability to raise equity capital in the future.


 We may need additional capital, and the sale of additional ADSs, Class Z ordinary shares, or other equity securities could result in additional
 dilution to our shareholders, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness could increase our debt obligations.
       We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, strategic acquisitions or other future developments. If these
 resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities.
 The sale of additional equity and equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The sale of substantial amounts of our
 Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs (including upon conversion of the concurrently offered convertible senior notes) could dilute the interests of
 our shareholders and the ADS holders and adversely impact the trading price of our listed securities. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in
 increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that
 financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.


 Conversion of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of the existing shareholders, including holders who had previously
 converted their notes.
        The conversion of some or all of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes or the 2027 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing
 shareholders and existing ADS holders. Any sales in the public market of the ADSs and/or Class Z ordinary shares issuable upon such conversion may
 increase the opportunities to create short positions with respect to the ADSs, which could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our Class Z
 ordinary shares and/or the ADSs. In addition, the existence of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes may encourage short
 selling by market participants because the conversion of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes could depress the price of
 our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs. The prices of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs could be affected by possible sales of our
 Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs by investors who view the convertible senior notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and
 by hedging or arbitrage trading activity, which we expect to occur involving our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs.


 Provisions of our convertible senior notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third-party.
       Certain provisions of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a
 third-party to acquire us, or may even prevent a third-party from acquiring us. For example, upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a
 fundamental change, holders of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to
 repurchase all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes. In the event of a fundamental change, we may also be required to
 increase the conversion rate for conversions in connection with such fundamental changes. By discouraging an acquisition of us by a third-party, these
 provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their securities at a premium over prevailing market prices.

                                                                               62

 Our dual-class share structure with different voting rights will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from
 pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial.
       We have a dual-class share structure such that our ordinary shares consist of Class Y ordinary shares and Class Z ordinary shares. In respect of
 matters requiring the votes of shareholders, holders of Class Z ordinary shares will be entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class Y ordinary
 shares will be entitled to ten votes per share based on our proposed dual-class share structure. The ADSs represent Class Z ordinary shares. Each
 Class Y ordinary share is convertible into one Class Z ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof, while Class Z ordinary shares are not convertible
 into Class Y ordinary shares under any circumstances. Upon any sale of Class Y ordinary shares by a holder thereof to any person other than Rui Chen,
 Yi Xu and Ni Li or any entity which is not ultimately controlled by any of Rui Chen, Yi Xu or Ni Li, such Class Y ordinary shares shall be automatically
 and immediately converted into the same number of Class Z ordinary shares.

        As of the date of this annual report, three of our directors, Rui Chen, Yi Xu and Ni Li, beneficially own all of our issued Class Y ordinary shares.
 As of February 28, 2022, these Class Y ordinary shares constitute approximately 21.4% of our total issued and outstanding shares and approximately
 73.2% of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding shares. As a result of the dual-class share structure and the concentration of
 ownership, holders of Class Y ordinary shares will have considerable influence over matters such as decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the
 sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. Such holders may take actions that are not in the
 best interest of us or our other shareholders. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company,
 which could have the effect of depriving our other shareholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company
 and may reduce the price of our listed securities. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage
 others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that our shareholders may view as beneficial.


 The dual-class structure of our ordinary shares may adversely affect the trading market for the Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs.
        S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain
 indices, including the S&P 500, to exclude companies with multiple classes of shares and companies whose public shareholders hold no more than 5%
 of total voting power from being added to such indices. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of
 multiple class structures. As a result, the dual-class structure of our ordinary shares may prevent the inclusion of the ADSs representing Class Z ordinary
 shares in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise
 seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for the ADSs. Any actions
 or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of
 the ADSs.


 Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market prices of the ADSs.
        Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third-party with the intention of buying
 identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the
 sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the
 sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative
 opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after
 selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.

       Public companies listed in the United States that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of
 the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and
 accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud.
 As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to
 shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.

                                                                                63
Table of Contents

        It is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such
 allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend
 ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against
 the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable federal or state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could
 be costly and time-consuming and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be
 groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations and stockholder’s equity, and the value of any investment in the ADSs
 could be greatly reduced or rendered worthless.


 Certain existing shareholders have substantial influence over our company and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other
 shareholders.
        We have adopted a dual-class voting structure such that our ordinary shares consist of Class Z ordinary shares and Class Y ordinary shares. Based
 on our dual-class voting structure, in respect of matters requiring a shareholders’ vote, holders of Class Z ordinary shares will be entitled to one vote per
 share, while holders of Class Y ordinary shares will be entitled to ten votes per share. Due to the disparate voting powers attached to these two classes of
 ordinary shares, three of our directors, Rui Chen, Yi Xu and Ni Li, beneficially own all of our issued Class Y ordinary shares. As of February 28, 2022,
 these Class Y ordinary shares in aggregate constitute approximately 21.4% of our total issued and outstanding ordinary shares and approximately 73.2%
 of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding ordinary shares. They may take actions that are not aligned with the interests of our
 shareholders, including the ADS holders. In addition, the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our
 Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs due to investors’ perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.


 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding
 our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs, the trading price and trading volume of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs could decline.
        The trading market for our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts
 publish about our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our Class Z ordinary shares, the trading price for our Class Z ordinary
 shares and/or the ADSs would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose
 visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume for our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs to
 decline.


 The sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs could adversely affect their trading price.
       Sales of substantial amounts of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur,
 could adversely affect the trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through
 equity offerings in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other
 shareholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs.


 Because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, investors must rely on price appreciation of our listed securities for return on
 their investments.
       We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business.
 As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, investors should not rely on an investment in our listed
 securities as a source for any future dividend income.

                                                                              64
Table of Contents

        Our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain requirements of Cayman Islands law. Even
 if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other
 things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our
 subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return to the
 shareholders and/or ADS holders will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our listed securities. There is no guarantee that our
 listed securities will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which the investors purchased these securities. Investors may not realize a return
 on their investment in our listed securities and may even lose their entire investment.


 Our shareholders may be subject to PRC income tax on dividends from us or on any gain realized on the transfer of our Class Z ordinary shares
 and/or the ADSs.
        Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, subject to any applicable tax treaty or similar arrangement between China and the jurisdiction of
 residence of the holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs that provides for a different income tax arrangement, PRC withholding tax at the
 rate of 10% is normally applicable to dividends from PRC sources payable to investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises, which do not have an
 establishment or place of business in China, or which have such establishment or place of business if the relevant income is not effectively connected
 with the establishment or place of business. Any gain realized on the transfer of ADSs or ordinary shares by such non-PRC resident enterprise investors
 is also subject to 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China, unless a tax treaty or similar arrangement
 provides otherwise. Under the PRC Individual Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, dividends from sources within China paid to foreign
 individual investors who are not PRC residents are generally subject to a PRC withholding tax at a rate of 20% and gains from PRC sources realized by
 such investors on the transfer of ADSs and/or Class Z ordinary shares are generally subject to 20% PRC income tax, in each case, subject to any
 reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties and similar arrangements and PRC laws. Although substantially all of our business operations
 are in China, it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs, or the gain realized from the transfer
 of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs, would be treated as income derived from sources within China and as a result be subject to PRC income
 tax if we were considered a PRC resident enterprise, as described above. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing
 Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavourable tax
 consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.” If PRC income tax were imposed on gains realized through the transfer of the
 ADSs or on dividends paid to our non-PRC resident investors, the value of the investment in our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs may be
 materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, the holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs whose jurisdictions of residence have tax
 treaties or similar arrangements with China may not qualify for benefits under such tax treaties or arrangements.


 There can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable
 year, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of our Class Z ordinary shares or ADSs.
       A non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of
 “passive” income; or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable
 to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, or the asset test. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we
 intend to treat the VIEs as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of
 these entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in
 our consolidated financial statements.

        Assuming that we are the owner of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we do not believe we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended
 December 31, 2021, and based upon our current income and assets, including goodwill and other unbooked intangibles not reflected on our balance
 sheet, and the value of the ADSs, we do not presently expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or the foreseeable future. However, no assurance
 can be given in this regard because the determination of whether we are or will become a PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that
 depends, in part, upon the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of the ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the
 current or subsequent taxable years because the value of our assets for the purpose of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price
 of the ADSs (which may be volatile). In particular, recent fluctuations in the market price of the ADSs increased our risk of becoming a PFIC. The
 market price of the ADSs may continue to fluctuate considerably and, consequently, we cannot assure you of our PFIC status for any taxable year. The
 composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. In addition, if it were determined that we
 do not own the stock of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our risk of being a PFIC may substantially increase.

                                                                                65
Table of Contents

       If we are a PFIC in any taxable year, a U.S. Holder may incur significantly increased U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or
 other disposition of the ADSs and on the receipt of distributions on the ADSs to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an “excess distribution”
 under U.S. federal income tax rules and such holder may be subject to burdensome reporting requirements. Further, if we are a PFIC for any year during
 which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs, we will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds
 the ADSs.


 Our memorandum and articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of
 our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs.
        The seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of
 our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an
 opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company
 in a tender offer or similar transaction. Our dual-class voting structure gives disproportionate voting power to the Class Y ordinary shares. In addition,
 our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their
 designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions,
 including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the
 rights associated with our ordinary shares, in the form of ADS or otherwise. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or
 prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares,
 the price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs
 may be materially and adversely affected.


 Our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests, and the ability to protect their rights through U.S. courts and Hong Kong courts
 may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.
       We are an exempted company limited by shares registered under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Our corporate affairs are governed by our
 memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as revised) of the Cayman Islands (as revised from time to time), or the Companies Act,
 and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the
 fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The
 common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from the common
 law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our
 shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes
 or judicial precedent in Hong Kong and some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities
 laws than Hong Kong and the United States. Some states in the United States, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted
 bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands.

       Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records or to
 obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Our directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine whether or not, and
 under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This
 may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from
 other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.

                                                                              66
Table of Contents

       Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, differ significantly from requirements for companies
 incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States. To the extent we choose to follow home country practice with respect to corporate
 governance matters, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic
 issuers or Hong Kong issuers.

      As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by
 management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the
 United States or Hong Kong.


 ADSs holders may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to claims arising under the deposit agreements, which could result in less favorable
 outcomes to the plaintiff(s) in any such action.
        The deposit agreement and the deposit agreement for restricted securities governing the ADSs representing our Class Z ordinary shares provide
 that, subject to the depositary’s right to require a claim to be submitted to arbitration, the federal or state courts in the City of New York have exclusive
 jurisdiction to hear and determine claims arising under the deposit agreements and in that regard, to the fullest extent permitted by law, ADS holders
 waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to our shares, the ADSs or the deposit
 agreements, including any claim under the U.S. federal securities laws.

        If we or the depositary opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver, the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on
 the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with the applicable U.S. state and federal law. To our knowledge, the enforceability of a
 contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the U.S. federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the
 United States Supreme Court. However, based on past court decisions, we believe that a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally
 enforceable, including under the laws of the State of New York, which govern the deposit agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual
 pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision, courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury
 trial. We believe that this is the case with respect to the deposit agreements and the ADSs. It is advisable that you consult legal counsel regarding the
 jury waiver provision before investing in the ADSs.

        If any holders or beneficial owners of ADSs bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under the relevant
 deposit agreements or the ADSs, including claims under U.S. federal securities laws, you or such other holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled to
 a jury trial with respect to such claims, which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and/or the depositary. If a lawsuit is
 brought against us and/or the depositary under the relevant deposit agreements, it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court,
 which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have had, including
 results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff(s) in any such action.

       Nevertheless, if this jury trial waiver provision is not enforced, to the extent a court action proceeds, it would proceed under the terms of the
 relevant deposit agreements with a jury trial. No condition, stipulation or provision of the relevant deposit agreements or ADSs serves as a waiver by
 any holder or beneficial owner of ADSs or by us or the depositary of compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
 promulgated thereunder.


 Certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.
       We are a Cayman Islands company and all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all of our current operations are
 conducted in China. In addition, a majority of our current directors and officers named in this annual report are nationals and residents of countries other
 than the United States or Hong Kong. Substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States or Hong Kong. As a result, it
 may be difficult or impossible for our shareholders to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that such
 shareholders believe that their rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws, Hong Kong laws, or otherwise. Even if such
 shareholders are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of China may render such shareholders unable to
 enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.

                                                                               67

 As a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance
 matters that differ significantly from the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards, and these practices may afford less protection to
 shareholders than shareholders would enjoy if we complied fully with the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.
       As a Cayman Islands exempted company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, we are subject to the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.
 However, the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its
 home country. Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from the Nasdaq
 corporate governance listing standards. We currently follow our home country practice that does not require us to seek shareholder approval for
 amending our share incentive plans. As a result, our investors may not be provided with the benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of
 Nasdaq.


 We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions
 applicable to U.S. domestic public companies.
        Because we are a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of U.S. securities rules and regulations
 that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:
        •     the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q;
        •     or current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC;
        •     the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under
              the Exchange Act;
        •     the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for
              insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and
        •     the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.

        We are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our
 results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Press releases relating to
 financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K.

        However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be
 filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, the ADS holders may not be afforded the same protections or information, which would be
 made available to the ADS holders, were they investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.


 ADS Holders may have fewer rights than holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights.
        Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights as our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying Class Z
 ordinary shares represented by the ADSs in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Holders of ADSs may not call a shareholders’
 meeting, and do not have any direct right to attend general meetings of our shareholders or to cast any votes at such meetings. Under our seventh
 amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the minimum notice period required to convene a general meeting is 10 days. Under the
 deposit agreement, ADS holders must vote by giving voting instructions to the depositary. If we ask for ADS holders’ instructions, then upon receipt of
 such voting instructions, the depositary will try to vote the underlying Class Z ordinary shares in accordance with these instructions. If we do not instruct
 the depositary to ask for ADS holders’ instructions, the depositary may still vote in accordance with instructions given by ADS holders, but it is not
 required to do so. ADS holders will not be able to directly exercise their rights to vote with respect to the underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented
 by the ADSs unless they withdraw the Class Z ordinary shares and become the registered holders of such Class Z ordinary shares prior to the record date
 for the general meeting.

                                                                              68

        When a general meeting is convened, holders of ADSs may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders’ meeting to permit withdrawal of the
 underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented by their ADSs to allow them to cast their votes with respect to any specific matter. If we ask for ADS
 holders’ instructions, the depositary will notify ADS holders of the upcoming vote and will arrange to deliver our voting materials to the ADS holders.
 We have agreed to give the depositary at least 30 business days’ prior notice of our shareholder meetings. Nevertheless, the depositary and its agents
 may not be able to send voting instructions to holders of ADSs or carry out their voting instructions in a timely manner. We will make all reasonable
 efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to holders of ADSs in a timely manner, but we cannot assure that holders of ADSs will receive the
 voting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote their ADSs. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be
 responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result,
 holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to vote and may lack recourse if the underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented by their
 ADSs are not voted as they requested.


 ADS holders may experience dilution of their holdings due to inability to participate in rights offerings.
        We may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under the deposit agreement, the depositary
 will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt
 from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. The
 depositary may, but is not required to, attempt to sell these undistributed rights to third parties, and may allow the rights to lapse. We may be unable to
 establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these
 rights or underlying securities or to endeavour to have a registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to
 participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result.


 ADS holders may be subject to limitations on transfer of their ADSs.
       In certain cases, the ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to
 time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may close its books from time to time for a number of
 reasons, including in connection with corporate events such as a rights offering, during which time the depositary needs to maintain an exact number of
 ADS holders on its books for a specified period. The depositary may also close its books in emergencies, and on weekends and public holidays. The
 depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of the ADSs generally when our share register or the books of the depositary are closed, or
 at any time if we or the depositary thinks it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or
 under any provision of the relevant deposit agreement, or for any other reason.


 We incur increased costs as a result of being a listed company in the United States and Hong Kong.
        As a public company listed in the United States and Hong Kong, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as
 a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq and the Listing Rules, impose various requirements on
 the corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and
 to make some corporate activities more time-consuming and costlier. In particular, as we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” we expect to
 incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
 Oxley Act of 2002 and the other rules and regulations of the SEC. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we need to increase the
 number of independent directors and adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. Operating as a public company
 will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy
 limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. In addition, we incur additional costs associated with our
 public company reporting requirements in the United States and Hong Kong. It may also be more difficult for us to find qualified persons to serve on our
 board of directors or as executive officers.

                                                                              69
Table of Contents

        We may be involved in class action lawsuits in the United States and Hong Kong in the future. Such lawsuits could divert a significant amount of
 our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur
 significant expenses to defend the lawsuits. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to
 raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a
 material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


 The different characteristics of the capital markets in Hong Kong and the U.S. may negatively affect the trading prices of our Class Z ordinary
 shares and/or ADSs.
        We are subject to Hong Kong and Nasdaq listing and regulatory requirements concurrently. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have
 different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different
 levels of retail and institutional participation). As a result of these differences, the trading prices of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs may not be
 the same, even allowing for currency differences. Fluctuations in the price of the ADSs due to circumstances peculiar to the U.S. capital markets could
 materially and adversely affect the price of our Class Z ordinary shares, or vice versa. Certain events having significant negative impact specifically on
 the U.S. capital markets may result in a decline in the trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares notwithstanding that such event may not impact the
 trading prices of securities listed in Hong Kong generally or to the same extent, or vice versa. Because of the different characteristics of the U.S. and
 Hong Kong capital markets, the historical market prices of the ADSs may not be indicative of the trading performance of our Class Z ordinary shares.


 Exchange between our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs may adversely affect the liquidity and/or trading price of each other.
       The ADSs are currently traded on Nasdaq. Subject to compliance with U.S. securities law and the terms of the deposit agreement, holders of our
 Class Z ordinary shares may deposit Class Z ordinary shares with the depositary in exchange for the issuance of the ADSs. Any holder of ADSs may
 also withdraw the underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented by the ADSs pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement for trading on the Hong
 Kong Stock Exchange. In the event that a substantial number of Class Z ordinary shares are deposited with the depositary in exchange for ADSs or vice
 versa, the liquidity and trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the ADSs on the Nasdaq may be adversely
 affected.


 There is uncertainty as to whether Hong Kong stamp duty will apply to the trading or conversion of the ADSs.
        Under the Hong Kong Stamp Duty Ordinance, any person who effects any sale or purchase of Hong Kong stock, defined as stock the transfer of
 which is required to be registered in Hong Kong, is required to pay Hong Kong stamp duty. The stamp duty is currently set at a total rate of 0.26% of the
 greater of the consideration for, or the value of, shares transferred, with 0.13% payable by each of the buyer and the seller. To the best of our knowledge,
 Hong Kong stamp duty has not been levied in practice on the trading or conversion of ADSs of companies that are listed in both the United States and
 Hong Kong and that have maintained all or a portion of their ordinary shares, including ordinary shares underlying ADSs, in their Hong Kong share
 registers. However, it is unclear whether, as a matter of Hong Kong law, the trading or conversion of ADSs of these dual-listed companies constitutes a
 sale or purchase of the underlying Hong Kong-registered ordinary shares that is subject to Hong Kong stamp duty. We advise investors to consult their
 own tax advisors on this matter. If Hong Kong stamp duty is determined by the competent authority to apply to the trading or conversion of the ADSs,
 the trading price and the value of your investment in our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs may be affected.


 The time required for the exchange between our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to
 settle or effect any sale of their securities during this period, and the exchange of Class Z ordinary shares into ADSs involves costs.
       There is no direct trading or settlement between the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on which the ADSs and our Class Z ordinary
 shares are respectively traded. In addition, the time differences between Hong Kong and New York, unforeseen market circumstances or other factors
 may delay the deposit of Class Z ordinary shares in exchange for ADSs or the withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares underlying the ADSs. Investors
 will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities during such periods of delay. In addition, there is no assurance that any exchange
 for Class Z ordinary shares into ADSs (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines that investors may anticipate.

                                                                              70

       Furthermore, the depositary for the ADSs is entitled to charge holders fees for various services including for the issuance of ADSs upon deposit of
 Class Z ordinary shares, cancelation of ADSs, distributions of cash dividends or other cash distributions, distributions of ADSs pursuant to share
 dividends or other free share distributions, distributions of securities other than ADSs and annual service fees. As a result, shareholders who exchange
 Class Z ordinary shares into ADSs, and vice versa, may not achieve the level of economic return the shareholders may anticipate.


 ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY
 A.    History and Development of the Company
       Our website was first launched in June 2009 and was officially named “bilibili” in January 2010. We commenced our commercial operations in
 2011 and established Shanghai Hode Information Technology Co., Ltd., which we refer to as Hode Information Technology in this annual report, to
 expand our operations in May 2013. Subsequently, we obtained control over Shanghai Kuanyu Digital Technology Co., Ltd., which we refer to as
 Shanghai Kuanyu in this annual report, in July 2014 to further expand our operations.

       We incorporated Bilibili Inc. under the laws of the Cayman Islands as our offshore holding company in December 2013. In February 2014, we
 established Hode HK Limited, or Hode HK, a wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary. In September 2014, Hode HK established a wholly-owned PRC
 subsidiary, Hode Shanghai Limited, which we refer to as Hode Shanghai in this annual report.

       Due to restrictions imposed by PRC laws and regulations on foreign ownership of companies that engage in internet and other related business,
 Hode Shanghai later entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Hode Information Technology and Shanghai Kuanyu, and their respective
 shareholders, and Chaodian Technology entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Chaodian Culture and its individual shareholders. We
 have also entered into contractual arrangements with several other affiliated entities and their respective nominee shareholders, through some of our
 subsidiaries other than Hode Shanghai or Chaodian Technology. As a result of our direct ownership in our WFOE and the VIE contractual arrangements,
 we are regarded as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. We treat them and their subsidiaries as our consolidated affiliated entities under U.S. GAAP, and
 have consolidated the financial results of these entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

       On March 28, 2018, the ADSs representing our Class Z ordinary shares commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol
 “BILI.” We raised from our initial public offering approximately $443.3 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and the
 offering expenses payable by us.

       In October 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Tencent, for Tencent to invest an aggregate amount of approximately
 US$317.6 million in our company, after deducting transaction expenses in an aggregate amount of approximately US$0.4 million, we received net
 proceeds of approximately US$317.2 million. On October 25, 2018, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Tencent for sharing and
 operating existing and additional anime and games on our platform.

        In December 2018, we and Taobao entered into a business collaboration agreement in content-driven e-commerce and commercialization of our
 intellectual property assets. Under the agreement, we and Taobao will collaborate to develop a dynamic ecosystem that will better connect content
 creators, merchandise and users on both platforms, among other things. Alibaba Group became our principal shareholder in February 2019 and further
 increased its shareholding in our company in 2021.

       In April 2019, we issued the April 2026 Notes. These notes bear interest at a rate of 1.375% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1
 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2019, and will mature on April 1, 2026. Concurrently with the issuance of April 2026 Notes, we
 also completed a registered offering of ADSs, where we offered 14,173,813 ADSs and certain selling shareholders offered 6,526,187 ADSs, at
 US$18.00 per ADS.

                                                                            71

       In July 2019, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire a controlling interest in Chaodian. In September 2020, we acquired the remaining
 interests in Chaodian through a series of transactions. Chaodian operates offline events, such as concerts and exhibitions Bilibili Macro Link and Bilibili
 World, and a talent agency that is currently managing many of our content creators. Chaodian has started to operate e-commerce and advertising
 business since the end of 2020.

      In June 2020, we issued the 2027 Notes. These notes bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and
 December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2020, and will mature on June 15, 2027.

       In 2020, we launched a series of branding campaign, including introduced trilogy videos Hou Lang, Ru Hai and Xi Xiang Feng and our brand
 proposition, Bilibili-All the Videos You Like. In April 2020, Sony Corporation invested in our company, and we entered into strategic collaboration
 arrangements. In September 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Riot Games and secured a three-year exclusive license for live
 broadcasting the League of Legends E-sports global events in China.

       In March 2021, our Class Z ordinary shares commenced trading on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the stock code
 “9626”. We raised from our global offering, consisting of an international offering of 28,000,000 Class Z ordinary shares and a Hong Kong public
 offering of 750,000 Class Z ordinary shares (the “Global Offering”), including the fully exercised over-allotment option of 3,750,000 Class Z ordinary
 shares, approximately HK$22.9 billion (RMB19.3 billion), after deducting underwriting fees and other offering expenses.

       In November 2021, we issued the December 2026 Notes. These notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on
 June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2022, and will mature on December 1, 2026. In March 2022, our board of directors
 authorized us to repurchase a portion of our existing December 2026 Notes through privately negotiated transactions. As of the date of this annual
 report, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of US$204.0 million of December 2026 Notes with a total cash consideration of
 US$147.9 million.

       In March 2022, our board of directors approved a motion to pursue the Primary Conversion, and authorized our senior management to proceed
 with the relevant preparatory work and undertake the necessary procedures to complete the Primary Conversion. After the Primary Conversion, we will
 remain as a dual-listing company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Global Select Market, and our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs will
 continue to be traded in both stock exchanges (as the case may be) and remain mutually fungible. The Primary Conversion is conditional upon and
 subject to, among other things, market conditions, further approval of our board of directors, and the obtaining of the necessary regulatory approvals.

 B.    Business Overview
       We are an iconic brand and a leading video community for young generations in China. Video is an intuitive, vivid and informative way to
 connect people with the world and has become a dominant medium for communication, entertainment and information. We refer to the trend of video
 integrating into the scenarios of everyday life as “videolization.” As a go-to video community for young generations in China, we believe we are well
 positioned to capture the attractive opportunities created by videolization.

                                                                             72
Table of Contents

        We are a full-spectrum video community that offers a wide array of content serving young generations’ diverse interests. We provide users with
 “All the Videos You Like” as our brand proposition. We have built our community around aspiring users, high-quality content, talented content creators
 and the strong emotional bond among them. In our community, users and content creators discover and interact with diverse content encompassing
 different interests, from lifestyle, game, entertainment, anime, knowledge to many more. We also enable broad video-based content consumption
 scenarios centered around professional user generated videos, or PUGV, supplemented with live broadcasting, occupationally generated videos, or OGV,
 and more. We have become the welcoming home of diverse cultures and interests and the destination to discover cultural trends and phenomena of
 young generations in China. We also promote Chinese original content advocating Chinese culture both in China and overseas.

        We adopt a user-centric commercialization model. Our ever-growing content ecosystem continues to satisfy our engaged and loyal users’ evolving
 needs, providing us with multiple levers for user-centric commercialization. We generate revenues primarily from mobile games, VAS, advertising,
 e-commerce and others. Our cost of revenues consists of revenue-sharing costs, content costs, server and bandwidth costs and e-commerce and other
 costs. For a detailed description, please see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Key Components of Results of Operations.”


 Our Users
        We have a young and culturally aspirational user base who are willing to invest in high-quality content and engaging user experience. Gen Z+
 constitutes the core of our user base. Our user base is quickly broadening to include users across different age groups and locations, who take interest in
 a full spectrum of content. We encourage users to not only discover and view, but also share and create quality content on our platform. We are dedicated
 to providing a wide variety of high-quality content to retain our existing users and attract new users with diverse interests and backgrounds.

       Our user base is growing rapidly. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had an average of 271.7 million MAU, as compared to an average of
 202.0 million MAU for the same period in 2020. Our users have demonstrated high level of engagement on our platform. The average daily time spent
 per active user on our mobile apps remained above 80 minutes in 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had approximately 2.2 billion average daily
 video views, representing an 80.4% year-over-year growth. In 2021, our users generated 8.5 billion average monthly interactions on our platform, as
 compared to 5.1 billion in 2020.

        Our official members who have passed our 100-question multiple-choice membership exam are even more engaged and loyal to our platform. As
 of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 145.3 million official members, representing a 41.6% increase year-over-year. We offer certain major
 interactive features on our platform exclusively to official members, as we believe the users who take and pass our membership exam are tuned to our
 community culture and values, hence contributing to our sticky user community with high retention rate. Our official members actively engage in a
 variety of social and interactive features offered on our platform, such as sending bullet chats, commenting and messaging. For official members who
 visited our platform in each month since 2020, their 3rd-month, 6th-month, 9th-month and 12th-month retention rate remained around 80%.


 Our Content Ecosystem
        We have built an ever-growing content ecosystem that is centered on video-based content including PUGV, live broadcasting, OGV and more. Our
 full-spectrum content ecosystem enables us to become a one-stop platform for users to find a wide variety of content that matches their interests and
 preferred video consumption scenarios, and for content creators to fully showcase their talent. The more talented content creators gather on our platform,
 the more inspiring and high-quality content is created, leading to more users, more engagement, and more followers and feedback for our content
 creators, which in turn encourages more content creators to join.


 Our Content
        We offer a full spectrum of engaging content, including video services, mobile games and value-added services, or VAS. Our content offerings
 cover a wide variety of categories. We have become the welcoming home of diverse interests. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had approximately
 2.2 billion average daily video views, representing an 80.4% year-over-year growth.

                                                                             73
Table of Contents

      We offer a comprehensive suite of video services, with PUGV as the cornerstone of our content ecosystem, and live broadcasting and OGV as
 major attractions of our platform.


       PUGV
       PUGV are the cornerstone of our content ecosystem and the main engine that powers our growth. PUGV contributed to 93.6% of the total video
 views on our platform in the fourth quarter of 2021. With the development of affordable and easy-to-use hardware including digital camcorders and
 mobile devices with high-resolution video cameras, as well as 5G technologies, the barrier for producing quality video content is gradually vanishing.
 Video production is now done by a wide range of participants, from amateurs, to semi-professional individuals with certain levels of production and
 editing skills and to professional production studios or workshops, with the lines between each category of content creators becoming increasingly
 blurred.

       We have a deep and diverse repository of PUGV on our platform. The PUGV on our platform typically showcase the content creators’ knowledge
 and expertise in the relevant field, providing viewers with a fulfilling experience and creating positive word-of-mouth. PUGV are popular among our
 users due to their originality and creativity as well as their interactive characteristics. Since our inception, our PUGV experienced strong growth in terms
 of not only the number of active content creators, but also the number and varieties of videos uploaded. In 2021, we received an average of
 approximately 9.3 million monthly videos submissions, as compared to 5.6 million in 2020. These videos were submitted by an average of
 approximately 2.6 million monthly active content creators in 2021, as compared to an average of approximately 1.8 million in 2020.

       With a growing number of content creators and the effective incentive mechanisms we provide to the content creators, we receive increasingly
 diverse and innovative content submissions, which we believe contribute to our mass market appeal. Our most popular PUGV categories were lifestyle,
 game, entertainment, anime and knowledge in terms of number of video views in 2021. While we enhance content offerings in our leading categories,
 we are actively expanding our content reach to new categories to cater to the evolving consumption needs of our users.

        We are broadening our video formats to address users’ needs in different access scenarios. In 2021, we launched our short-form video “story
 mode” on our mobile apps, catering to users’ video consumption needs in fragmented time. We believe this model will satisfy our users’ content
 consumption needs on-the-go, enhance users’ engagement level, and help users discover more PUGVs and live broadcasting content across our video
 universe. We introduced Bilibili app on smart TV as a solution for users seeking high quality, high resolution and immersive video experience on a
 larger screen.


       Live broadcasting
        We view live broadcasting as a natural extension to the video services, which allows users to interact and engage in real time, integrated with
 various content categories and user interests. Content creators who have accumulated a considerable fan base through PUGV get to further solidify their
 relationship with their fans by hosting live broadcastings to interact on a real-time basis. Many live broadcasting hosts come from the PUGV content
 creators on our platform.

        Games are the most popular category of the live broadcasting content on our platform. For example, in September 2020, we entered into a
 strategic partnership with Riot Games, the developer of leading MOBA League of Legends, pursuant to which we were granted a three-year exclusive
 license for live broadcasting the League of Legends E-sports global events in China, including the world-renowned League of Legends World
 Championship, Mid-Season Invitational, and All-Star Event in China beginning in 2020 through the 2023 Mid-Season Invitational. 2021 League of
 Legends World Championship S11 enjoyed great popularity. On the final game night, the peak concurrent viewers increased by over 150% compared
 with S10 in 2020, and the DAUs also reached a record high in our operation history.

        In addition to live broadcasting of games, we also provide entertainment live broadcasting consisting of virtual host live broadcasting, audio-
 related live broadcasting and other live broadcasting. We are continuously enriching our live broadcasting content and increasing user penetration. We
 are dedicated to attracting more talents and hosts to introduce more live broadcasting channels and provide diversified content. We believe the diverse
 live broadcasting content provides an interactive user experience and contributes to our user growth.

                                                                             74
Table of Contents

       OGV
       Our OGV offering consists of Bilibili-produced or jointly produced content and licensed content procured from third-party production companies.
 We leverage our rich OGV offering to accumulate IP assets, attract more users and convert them into paying users, inspire the creation of PUGV content
 creators and to expand content categories to supplement the PUGV content. Our investment in OGV has contributed to the growth in our user base and
 the amount of our paying users, and we expect the momentum to continue as we roll out more quality OGV content. As our net revenues continue to
 grow, we do not expect our total content costs as a percentage of total revenue to substantially increase.

       Our original content includes both Bilibili produced and co-produced content with quality domestic and international third-party partners. We
 typically leveraged our insights of users’ preferences and collaborated with professional production companies to produce OGVs. Our OGV cover
 Chinese and overseas anime, documentaries, variety shows, selected TV shows and movies.

       We have a large anime library, providing Chinese anime and Japanese anime series, etc. We have self-produced and co-produced over 130 Chinese
 anime titles from 2019 to 2021. In November 2021, we announced 50 new Chinese anime titles on our 4th Made by Bilibili Chinese Anime Press
 Conference and officially upgraded our Chinese anime proposition to “Made by Bilibili, Made for Global.” Over the past two years, we have established
 business cooperation with Netflix and Sony, distributing 24 Chinese anime titles to the overseas markets.

       For example, our self-produced Chinese anime title Heaven Official’s Blessing received great popularity in China, gaining over 450 million video
 views by the end of 2021. Subsequently, we cooperated with Sony’s Funimation and Netflix to distribute this title to the overseas market. In 2021, we
 launched Link Click, another Bilibili-produced Chinese anime, accumulating over 180 million video views by the end of 2021. Collaborating with
 Sony’s Funimation, this title was released in multiple countries and regions.

       Our OGV also cover documentaries, selected TV shows, movies and variety shows. We have provided over 3,000 documentaries on our platform
 in 2021, showcasing our large documentary repositories in China. In November 2021, we hosted our first Bilibili Documentary Press Conference and
 announced 21 new documentaries to be released in the coming years. For example, The Story of Chuaner, Bilibili-produced food documentary,
 welcomed its third season in 2021. Followed the previous two seasons’ popularity, the season three was an immediate hit, gained over 120 million video
 views by the end of 2021. In the variety show department, we produced match-making variety show 90 Hun Jie Suo and the music variety show The
 Next Banger in 2021. Those new series quickly attracted the followers with relevant interests and received wide recognitions even beyond our
 community.

       In addition, we have partnered with reputable content providers for licensed videos, including leading PRC and overseas television networks and
 studios. See “—Our Strategic Partners” for more information.


       Mobile games
        There is a large population of online games enthusiasts among our users. Game is the second most popular category of our PUGV and the most
 popular category of our live broadcasting content in 2021. We view mobile games as an adaptive form of video-based content that share many
 commonalities. Leveraging our deep understanding of users’ preference in online games and rich experience in games operation and distribution, we
 select mobile games compatible with our users’ interest, such as animation and comics themed mobile games where we hold advantages. We are also
 expanding our game offerings to other genres, such as casual games and role-playing games. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 59 exclusively
 distributed mobile games, and hundreds of jointly operated mobile games.

       We have obtained the exclusive distribution rights of various mobile games from leading global and domestic mobile game developers. The most
 popular exclusively distributed mobile games on our platform include Fate/Grand Order, Guardian Tales and Azur Lane. In April 2021, we launched
 the highly anticipated Japanese role playing game Guardian Tales, an anime-based role-playing mobile game. This exclusively licensed game was an
 immediate hit, attracting millions of players and topping China’s iOS download and grossing charts after its release.

                                                                           75

       We have also acquired exclusive distribution rights of mobile games to bring them to like-minded ACG game lovers in the overseas markets,
 including South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asian countries. Building on our years’ game operating experience and deep understanding of ACG culture,
 in 2021, we have successfully launched Final Gear in Japan and Figure Story in South Korea.

      In addition to exclusively licensed mobile games, we also jointly operate a large number of mobile games with well-known domestic developers.
 Popular jointly operated mobile games on our platform include Genshin Impact and Arknights.

       To cater to the next generation’s game demand, we are committed to building up our internal game self-development capabilities, leveraging our
 deep understanding of user preferences and our rich game operating experience. As of December 31, 2021, we own six game studios with over 1,000
 members working on our pipelines of projects.


       Maoer and Bilibili Comic
       Leveraging our mass user base of ACG enthusiasts, we expanded our offering to ACG-related comic and audio content and efficiently converted a
 large number of our existing ACG enthusiast users to audiences of the new offerings. We launched the Bilibili Comic, a mobile app offering anime and
 comic content in 2019 to enrich our content offerings. In the same year, to further expand our content offerings, we started to offer audio drama such as
 audio books and music mainly contributed by professional and amateur content creators that can be accessed through Maoer, an audio platform. As a
 natural extension from our core ACG content offerings, we see great synergy effects between our main platform and each of the Bilibili Comic and
 Maoer platform and their significant growth potential.


 Our Content Creators
        The creation of PUGV by our content creators has been the primary source of user traffic and the key driver for the growth of our user base and
 communities. We have cultivated a nourishing environment to allow content creators to grow and flourish on our platform, empowering them to easily
 upload content, actively interact with users and effectively accumulate broader fan bases. We respect original creation and work to ensure that our
 content creators will stay and grow with our platform. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had 3.0 million average monthly active content creators and
 received 10.9 million average monthly video submissions, compared to 1.9 million and 5.9 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 93.6%
 of the total video views are contributed by PUGV in the fourth quarter of 2021.

       Retaining and expanding our network of content creators who upload and contribute quality content to our platform is essential to us. We have
 taken a number of initiatives to encourage and facilitate production of creative PUGV by content creators, including various monetization opportunities
 to unlock their commercialization potential. In 2021, 1.3 million content creators have received monetary reward via multiple avenues on our platform,
 including, but not limited to, cash incentive program, native advertising, live broadcasting, virtual gifting and customized commercial contracts.

       Content creators of different levels are encouraged and incentivized by various measures. For top-level content creators, we offer them customized
 premium services to maximize their influence and unlock their commercial value. Certain top-level content creators are recognized as Bilibili Top 100
 Content Creators for their outstanding achievements. For middle-level content creators, we reward them mainly through our cash incentive program. As
 of December 31, 2021, approximately 550,000 content creators participated in the cash incentive program. For newly joined content creators and
 amateur content creators, we provide online and offline tutorials to improve their video quality, and video editing tools to make creation process easier
 and more accessible. For example, our UP Academy offers various tutorial videos prepared by seasoned content creators on various aspects of content
 creation and the tips of being a skillful content creator, including video shooting techniques, software, marketing and branding strategies, and many
 other subjects.

                                                                            76
Table of Contents

       We also offer analytic tools to allow content creators to see a range of backstage data, such as demographics of followers and viewers, and data on
 user behavior, such as following/un-following, viewing, commenting and bullet chatting. Such information gives content creators insights into current
 trends and user preferences and help content creators improve and make their creative work more relevant. In addition, we hold seminars to share
 experience and techniques, and reward those content of high-quality, reputation and popularity. These programs help content creators improve their
 techniques, deepen their bond in this community, and incentivize them to create better content. In 2021, the average number of monthly active content
 creators was 2.6 million, as compared to 1.8 million in 2020. These creative minds open our platform up to expanded content categories and in turn,
 increase user traffic and expand user demographics.

        All of our live broadcasting hosts and content creators are bound by our community regulations and standard terms of service, which set forth
 various policies of conduct, content, privacy and the intellectual property right ownership, also the revenue sharing arrangements between hosts and
 content creators and us. Most live broadcasting hosts and content creators are not professional or full time. We identify certain talent and content
 creators that create popular content and represents our values and beliefs and execute customized contracts with them. We also cooperate with talent
 agencies which recruit, manage, train, support and promote hosts and content creators. Customized host contracts are negotiated on a case-by-case basis
 and generally contain revenue sharing arrangements and exclusivity clauses. Except as disclosed above, we do not have other material transactions,
 agreements or understanding with our content creators or live broadcasting hosts, other than in their capacity as our content creators or live broadcasting
 hosts.


 Our Community
        The vitality and integrity of our communities are cornerstones of our business and a priority of our business development strategy. Our users are
 attracted to our platform because of our creative content and retained by our diverse, inclusive and vibrant community. To preserve our culture and
 community values, we have employed the following features in operating our communities.

       Membership exam. Users need to pass our multiple-choice membership exam consisting of 100 questions in order to become our “official
 members,” after which additional interactive and community features, such as bullet chatting and commenting, will become available to them. The
 membership exam includes questions on community etiquette regarding uploading videos and sending bullet chats, and a set of interest-based questions
 from a range of topics, such as anime, music, fashion and technology. Users need to answer a total of 60 questions correctly to pass the membership
 exam. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 145.3 million official members who had passed our membership exam, representing a 41.6%
 increase year-over-year.

        Signature community management. We believe official members who have passed the membership exam tend to develop a strong sense of
 belonging and ownership to our platform. To protect the community values and contribute to a more harmonious community, our veteran users have
 voluntarily formed a community discipline committee to collectively evaluate the appropriateness of content posted on our platform, the results of which
 will be used to train our AI system for content and information monitoring on our platform. If we confirm that a user has uploaded content that contains
 inappropriate content, such as pornography, violence, provocative or hate speech, invasion of personal privacy, personal attacks, and fraudulent or other
 offensive information, we may temporarily suspend or permanently terminate such user’s account, and display such user’s account information and
 reason for the disciplinary action under the “Dark Chamber” tab, which is open to all users on our platform. This measure also allows users to
 participate in the management of our communities and helps us educate users and foster a self-regulating environment to preserve and strengthen the
 community values that we hold dear. See “—Content Management and Review.”

       Community events. Every year, we hold large festivals and community events for our users, including New Year’s Eve Gala, Chinese New Year
 Gala, Bilibili Macro Link and Bilibili World. We also invite content creators to participate in these events. Chinese New Year Gala is our signature
 community event that we started in 2010 where we invite all content creators to create and upload ACG-inspired videos and select the best among them
 to produce an extended program according to each year’s theme to celebrate Chinese New Year with our users. In January 2022, we hosted the Bilibili
 Top 100 Content Creators Award Ceremony to celebrate and award the outstanding achievements of leading content creators in various categories. We
 marked the end of the year with our New Year’s Eve Gala, The Most Beautiful Night of 2021. The event has continued its popularity within the peak
 popularity index of 310 million during the broadcasting night, making us the signature countdown event for young generations in China.

                                                                             77

 Our Platform
 Access to our platform
        Our platform includes our “Bilibili” mobile apps, PC websites, Smart TV, Bilibili Comic, Maoer and a variety of related features, functionalities,
 tools and services that we provide to users and content creators. For mobile devices, users typically access our content through our Bilibili mobile apps,
 or a mobile website that is largely similar in terms of functionality and appearance to our mobile apps. Our mobile apps are available for user download
 from the Apple and Android app stores. We also provide a PC website at www.bilibili.com and offer quality content across on smart TV devices. The
 majority of our active users are on mobile, and our mobile products continue to grow faster than our PC products. In 2021, MAU from our mobile
 products accounted for over 90% of our MAU on average.

       We utilize our big data analytical capabilities in our feed system to categorize and recommend content based on user data captured on our platform
 and analytics produced by our deep learning algorithms. The basic features we offer on our platform include content uploading, viewing and
 commenting. Our platform also can categorize, rank, search for, curate and recommend content uploaded and viewed to simplify the content discovery
 process.


 Our social and interactive features
       Our communities are built on creative content as well as vibrant interactions among users. Users’ interactions on our platform revolve around
 content, and the social and interactive features of our platform allow users who share similar interests and hobbies to find, engage with and bond with
 each other to establish a common bond. We provide the following social and interactive features for our users. In 2021, our users generated 8.5 billion
 average monthly interactions on our platform, as compared to 5.1 billion in 2020.

        Bullet chatting. Bullet chatting is a commenting function that we pioneered, which enables content viewers to send comments that fly across the
 screen like bullets, and has become very popular among young internet users in China. Only official member who passed our membership exam can
 send bullet chats on our platform. Bullet chats are context-based and can be viewed by the audiences who watch the same content, and therefore can
 intrigue interactive commenting among content viewers. The bullet chatting feature has transformed the video-viewing experience from one-way
 content display to a brand new interactive experience by sharing with other enthusiasts who empathize with each other.

       Other interactive features. Users can show appreciation in various ways to encourage content creators, such as liking, voting, following, adding to
 favorites and casting coin. Users can also opt to follow a content creator so they can see the content creator’s newly posted activities promptly on their
 own timeline. In addition, we invented a unique interaction feature, “one click triple-function combo.” Through one long pressing on the screen, users
 can complete liking, coin casting and adding to favourite library in a roll to show their special appreciation, which has become Bilibili signature
 interactive function and been widely used in our community.

        Interacting with fans. Content creators can use moment, fans group, live broadcasting and interactive video to interact with their fans. Bilibili
 moment enables users to express and share their interests and stories in multimedia content such as text, pictures and video. Content creators can utilize
 this feature to notify their followers when they upload new content on our platform. In addition, users can join fans group to interact with content
 creators. In addition, live broadcasting allows content creators to set up channels to interact with fans on a real-time basis. Furthermore, we launched the
 interactive video function in July 2019, where users are involved in making choices for the characters in the videos and change the plot as the story
 develops.

       Gifting and rewarding. Users can send free or paid virtual items to live broadcasting hosts and content creators to show their support and
 appreciation.

       Sharing and communicating. Users can share and repost content uploaded by other users, add comments, send instant messages and view their
 history of interactions with other users.

                                                                             78

 Our Commercialization Model
        Capitalizing our engaged user base, expanding content ecosystem, and vibrant community, we are well positioned to capture users’ evolving
 demand and increase lifetime value of our users by satisfying such demand. As we develop deep insights into user interests and behavior, we curate
 the right content and service offerings compatible with user demand, achieving efficient user-centric commercialization. Our commercialization
 efforts are based on the integrated goals of offering quality content catering to user preference to attract users, building vibrant communities to retain
 users, and provide quality content and products to achieve commercialization. We generate revenues primarily from mobile games, VAS, advertising,
 e-commerce and others. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our average number of monthly paying users was 24.5 million, as compared to 17.9 million in
 the same period of 2020.


 Mobile games
       Games is the second most popular genre category of our PUGV based on video views in 2021. A substantial portion of our users are game lovers.
 We started to publish mobile games on our platform for third-party developers in January 2014, and launched our first self-developed game in August
 2017.

       Our significant growth in net revenues initially around 2016 was primarily attributable to our mobile games operations. As a key component of
 ACG culture, game related content remained one of the most popular genres on our platform based on video views since our inception. Recognizing the
 large population of game lovers among our users and a strong propensity to spend on mobile games of our typical users, we started to introduce
 animation and comics themed mobile games that resonate well with our communities and user preferences. Some of these games are sourced taking into
 consideration of the popularity of related video content on our platform. Mobile games have thus become a natural extension of our video content
 offerings through which we achieve efficient monetization. In addition, our sticky user community with strong preference for ACG-related content
 enables us to obtain exclusive distribution rights of various popular, high-quality mobile games from leading global and domestic game developers,
 particularly with regards to ACG-themed mobile games.

       As our user base and user demand expand, we continue to launch new service offerings and diversify our monetization channels beyond mobile
 games. As a result, while our net revenues continued to grow substantially, mobile games revenues contribution as a percentage of total net revenues
 decreased over the past few years, with the rise of other revenue streams. We derived 53.1%, 40.0% and 26.3% of our revenues from mobile games in
 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our top 3 mobile games in aggregate contributed 36.4%, 23.8% and 10.7% of our total net revenues in 2019, 2020
 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all mobile games on our platform are developed by third-party developers and we select and curate mobile games
 on our platform based on content, themes, cultural characteristics and features that appeal to our users. Our users access the mobile games on our
 platform, and log into and play with their Bilibili accounts. Users’ purchase of in-game virtual items to enhance their game-playing experiences is the
 primary source of our revenue generated from mobile games. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 59 exclusively distributed mobile games and
 hundreds of jointly operated mobile games. For our exclusively distributed mobile games, we generally were granted royalty bearing license with the
 exclusive right to market and distribute mobile games in China and other countries and regions in Asia. We also entered into joint operating agreements
 with game developers and distributors pursuant to which we were granted non-exclusive licenses to promote and distribute games on our platform. We
 negotiate revenue sharing arrangements or licensing fees with mobile game developers on a case-by-case basis and such arrangements are generally
 consistent with industry norms. Our exclusively distributed mobile games contributed to 78.7%, 75.3% and 71.3% of our mobile games revenues during
 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

      We routinely customize our exclusively distributed mobile games and adapt them to our users’ preferences and provide operation and servicing
 support with our own servers to optimize the game experience for our users. For jointly operated mobile games, we generally provide distribution,
 payment solutions and market promotion services, while game developers are responsible for providing game products, hosting and maintenance of
 game servers and determining the pricing of in-game virtual items.

       To further explore opportunities in this business sector, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Tencent in October 2018,
 pursuant to which we would jointly operate more Tencent games on our platform. We have entered into business collaboration with Sony to bring more
 high-quality anime content and mobile games to our users.

       To cater to the next generation’s game demand, we are building up our game self-development capabilities, leveraging our deep understanding of
 user preferences and our rich game operation experience. As of December 31, 2021, we own six game studios with over 1,000 members working on our
 pipelines of projects.

                                                                              79

 VAS
       We also achieve commercialization through the various types of VAS we offer, including our premium membership program, live broadcasting
 and other value-added services, including comics on Bilibili Comic and audio drama on Maoer.

        In January 2018, we launched a premium membership program allowing paying members to enjoy an exclusive or advance access to certain high-
 quality OGV. We charge our premium members’ membership fees monthly, quarterly or annually, based on the service package that they select. As of
 December 31, 2021, we had 20.1 million premium members. We plan to continue to roll out more high-quality OGV content and convert more paying
 users.

       We extend diversified live broadcasting content covering a broad range of interests. We offer various virtual items for sale on our live
 broadcasting. Users can purchase in-app virtual items and send them as virtual gifts to their favorite hosts to show appreciation and provide them with
 monetary rewards. These virtual items can produce special effects on the screen, such as Bilibili Spaceship and fireworks. As we attract a growing
 number of hosts and talent agencies to hold live broadcasting on our platform, and encourage more content creators to become hosts, the revenue
 generated from sales of virtual items increases.

        We share revenues from the sales of virtual items generated on our live broadcasting with our hosts and talent agencies. We encourage our content
 creators to host live broadcasting on our platform to interact with their fans on a real time basis, enhance their popularity and in turn attract and retain
 users. We have entered into exclusive cooperation agreements with certain hosts with top popularity on our platform, pursuant to which we offer these
 hosts more attractive rewards in addition to the revenue-sharing arrangements. We plan to enter into cooperation agreements with more hosts in the
 future to secure popular hosts and further expand our live broadcasting. The top 10 content creators and live broadcasting hosts contributed to less than
 1% of our total revenues during 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

       We also offered anime and comic content through the mobile app, Bilibili Comic and offered audio drama through Maoer audio program from
 2019 to expand our content offerings. As a natural extension from our core ACG content offerings, we see great synergy effects between our main
 platform and each of the Bilibili Comic and Maoer platform and their significant growth potential.


 Advertising
      Our typical users, the Gen Z+ with high educational backgrounds and increasing disposable income who spend time on quality content, are well-
 chased by advertisers. Advertisers are also seeking out innovative platforms with high user traffic to enhance their visibility. We believe our rapidly
 growing community and increasing brand awareness makes Bilibili a preferred platform for advertisers.

       We offer various advertising formats including brand advertising, performance-based advertising and native advertising. Brand advertisements
 primarily appear on the app opening page, the top banner, the website home page banner and the inline video feed alongside organic feeds. Brand
 advertisements can also be customized according to advertisers’ need and appeared in Bilibili-produced OGV or events. Performance-based
 advertisements primarily appear as video or picture and text-based feeds alongside with organic feeds, the banner underneath the video-playing frame
 and in the story mode. This format allows us to push personalized feed advertisements to users throughout our platform. Native advertisings are
 customized according to advertisers’ needs, produced by our content creators and embedded naturally in their video creations. As the native
 advertisements are usually cohesive with the content of our platform, assimilated into the design and consistent with the form of content presentation on
 our platform, our users tend to view them as regular video content.

                                                                              80
Table of Contents

       In addition, we offer integrated marketing campaigns to provide a one-stop marketing solution for our advertisers. Advertisers can leverage our
 brand advertising to raise their brand awareness, use native advertisements to influence user’s purchase decision and convert sales through our
 performance-based advertisements. The all-around marketing campaigns were well-received by the users and brought satisfactory results for our
 advertisers. The price of our advertising service is determined on a case-by-case basis and depends upon various factors, including the format and
 duration of the advertisement, targeting scope, display location and so on. We provide various sales incentives to our advertising service customers,
 including cash incentives in the form of commissions to certain third-party advertising agencies and noncash incentives such as discounts and
 advertising services provided free of charge in certain bundled arrangements, which are negotiated on a contract by contract basis with customers. The
 incentives are based on revenue volume and incentive rate, which are negotiated on a contract by contract basis. We account for these incentives granted
 to customers as variable consideration in accordance with ASC 606 that is net of our revenues. The amount of variable consideration is measured based
 on the most likely amount of incentive to be provided to customers. We do not have other material transactions, agreements or understanding with our
 advertising customers, other than in their capacity as our advertising customers.


 E-commerce and others
        Our e-commerce initiatives are focused around the IP value of ACG-related content. We offer ACG-related merchandise and generate revenue
 from sales of these products. For example, for users who are particularly interested in a certain anime, we recommend to them merchandise of the same
 theme and convert into sales on our e-commerce platform. We also generate revenue from certain offline activities we hold, including selling events
 tickets and peripheral products.


 Our Strategic Partners
       We collaborate with reputable industry players to enhance our content offerings and to strengthen our user-centric commercialization capabilities.
 We partner with domestic and overseas content partners to continually expand and deepen our content repository. We also work with talent agencies in
 expanding our content creator group as well as in diversifying our content offerings. We contract with talent agencies to recruit, manage, train and
 support our hosts and pay talent agencies a percentage of the total revenues from virtual gifting made to the hosts managed by such talent agencies. We
 work with advertisers in a variety of industries due to our rapidly growing community and increasing brand awareness. We enter into advertising service
 agreements with advertisers directly or through advertising agencies. The price of our advertising services depends upon various factors, including the
 duration and form of the advertisements and popularity of the content or event in which the advertisements will be placed. We cooperate with leading
 global and domestic mobile game developers to distribute their mobile games on our platform. Under our agreements for exclusively distributed mobile
 games, we are typically responsible for the launch of the games, hosting and maintenance of game servers, determination of when and how to operate
 in-game promotions and customer services and the pricing of in-game virtual items, and making localized versions for overseas licensed games. Under
 our agreements for jointly operated mobile games, we are typically responsible for distributing games and providing payment solution and market
 promotion service. Proceeds earned from selling in-game virtual items are shared between us and the third-party game developers pursuant to the
 agreements. We believe our large and diverse user base presents a prime opportunity for our strategic partners to reach a growing number of audiences.
 We have also entered into revenue sharing arrangements with distribution channels including iOS and Android-based app stores to distribute our mobile
 games. To provide multiple payment methods for our users, we contracted with online payment channels and pay fees based on the amount of payment
 made through the payment channel.

        In October 2018, Tencent, our principal shareholder, further invested in our company, and we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with
 Tencent for sharing and operating existing and additional anime and games on Bilibili’s online platform, pursuant to which we and Tencent shall
 participate in the exchange and purchase of existing anime copyright, and jointly procure, produce and invest in anime projects, as well as seek
 investment opportunities in the anime and comic industry. In addition, we would expand our cooperation with Tencent by jointly operating more Tencent
 games on our platform.

        In December 2018, we and Alibaba Group commenced our business collaboration in the content creation and commercialization front. Under the
 agreement, content creators on Bilibili will promote merchandise by producing content in a creative and interactive format. Taobao will also work with
 us to promote and commercialize Bilibili’s IP assets, leveraging consumer insights on both platforms. Alibaba Group became our principal shareholder
 in February 2019 and further increased its shareholding in our company in 2021. Alibaba has become one of our major brand advertisers. In 2019, 2020
 and 2021, Tmall and Taobao of Alibaba placed advertisements on our platform for their promotion campaigns. In December 2019, JuHuaSuan of
 Alibaba acted as the title sponsor of our New Year’s Eve Gala “The Most Beautiful Night of 2019.” In August 2021, Tmall acted as the principal
 sponsor of our music-themed variety show “The Next Banger.”

        In April 2020, we received a strategic investment from Sony and entered into a business collaboration agreement to pursue collaboration
 opportunities within the area of entertainment business in the Chinese market, including anime and mobile game. We would support Sony in deepening
 its understanding of and insight into the Chinese entertainment market. In October 2020, we deepened our partnership with Sony by entering into a
 strategic agreement with its subsidiary Aniplex Inc. to introduce more high-quality anime content and mobile games on our platform. Under the
 agreement, we will obtain certain exclusive distribution rights of Aniplex’s anime content and will pay Aniplex different fees per episode for different
 anime series. We also entered into revenues sharing arrangements for exclusive distribution of Aniplex’s mobile games. We also collaborated with
 Funimation, the global anime streaming platform of Sony, to distribute our Chinese anime works to the worldwide audiences. In 2021, we cooperated
 with Sony’s Funimation and released five Chinese anime titles in multiple countries and regions, including Link Click, our self-produced Chinese anime.

                                                                            81

 Branding and Marketing
       We have been retaining and expanding our user base by providing high-quality content since our inception, and we have cultivated a deep and
 diverse content pool well recognized among Generation Z+. In addition to viral marketing, word of mouth referrals and repeat user visits driven by
 superior user experience, quality content and product offerings, we implement various branding and marketing measures to promote our brand
 awareness among existing and potential users and advertisers. Our primary areas of focus are on continuously increasing brand awareness and
 acquisition of users through targeted channels.

       We launched a series of campaigns aimed at spreading the Bilibili brand name and our slogan Bilibili-All the Videos You Like among a broader
 audience, in tandem with expanding our content appeal to a mass market. In June 2021, we held a live CEO speech to celebrate our 12-year anniversary,
 underlining our mission of creating an outstanding community for all of our users and content creators, and bringing Chinese original content to users
 worldwide. We held various activities to reinforce impacts across different user demographics. For example, we held Bilibili Summertime Graduation
 Ceremony Concert and China’s Youth Day promotion video to increase our awareness in student groups. In addition, we held various branding
 campaigns in 2021 to enrich users’ daily lives, including various off-line events on campus, anime exhibitions, ceremonies and other events. We marked
 the end of the year with our third successful New Year’s Eve Gala, The Most Beautiful Night of 2021, achieving high popularity among our users. These
 branding and marketing initiatives have allowed us to connect and resonate with more users and expand to more diverse audience.

        These branding and marketing efforts contribute and foster our market leadership as a go-to video community for young generations in China. In
 addition, our average MAU increased significantly from 117.5 million in 2019, to 185.8 million in 2020 and further to 249.8 million in 2021. We design
 our sales and marketing efforts with careful consideration to raise brand awareness, attracted a broader user base and promote our services. Going
 forward, we expect to continuously evaluate and monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion campaigns and marketing spending in order
 to further enhance our brand awareness and attract a broader user base in a sustainable manner. We expect to effectively manage our sales and marketing
 expenses to bring more users and revenues to us and expand our operating leverage.


 User Privacy and Safety
       The vitality and integrity of our communities are cornerstones of our business. We dedicate significant resources to the goal of strengthening our
 communities through developing and implementing programs designed to protect user privacy, promote a safe environment, and ensure the security of
 user data. The user privacy policy on our platform describes our data use practices and how privacy works on our platform. Specifically, we provide
 users with adequate notice as to what data are being collected and undertake to manage and use the data collected in accordance with applicable laws
 and make reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized use, loss or leak of user data. Our user privacy policy, Bilibili Privacy Policy, has clearly
 specified the type of user information that will be collected under different scenarios. For example, a user will need to provide the user name, and phone
 number or email address when registering an account on our platform. When a user opens our mobile app for the first time, registers an account via our
 mobile app or website, logs into his/her account, or any modification is made to the Bilibili Privacy Policy, a notice will pop-up on this user’s device
 requiring this user to read and consent to the Bilibili Privacy Policy. In addition, we use a variety of technologies to protect the data with which we are
 entrusted and have a team of privacy professionals dedicated to the ongoing review and monitoring of data security practices. For example, we store all
 user data in encrypted format and strictly limit the number of personnel who can access those servers that store user data. For our external interfaces, we
 also utilize firewalls to protect against potential attacks or unauthorized access.


 Content Management and Review
        We maintain two levels of content management and review procedures to monitor the content uploaded to our platform to help ensure that no
 content that may be deemed to be illegal or inappropriate under government rules and regulations is posted and to promptly remove any infringing
 content. The first level of review procedure is conducted through our proprietary artificial intelligence-based screening system. This system
 automatically flags and screens out newly uploaded videos that have piracy issues or contain illegal or inappropriate content by comparing them with
 copyrighted or objectionable videos stored in our own in-house “black list” databases and identifying those with similar codes. Once the content is
 processed by our technology screening system, our system then extracts fingerprint trails from the content and sends them to our content screening team
 for the second-level review. As of December 31, 2021, our content screening team consists of approximately 3,000 employees dedicated to screening
 and monitoring the content uploaded on our platform to ensure that the flagged content identified by our screening system is reviewed and confirmed
 before it can be released. We provide initial training during the onboarding process for new hires. We also offer periodic training sessions to keep these
 employees apprised of any regulatory and policy changes, and supervise and monitor their work. All of the content needs to go through these two levels
 of review procedures before it is released on our platform.

                                                                             82

        All of the other content, primarily consisting of bullet chats posted by users, is also automatically filtered by our screening system, which utilizes
 an artificial intelligence-based screening system to conduct semantic analysis on bullet chats to analyze, identify and screen out inappropriate bullet
 chats. With respect to live broadcasting, we have a separate monitoring team to review and monitor the content and activities of hosts of our live
 broadcasting as well as the bullet chats posted by viewers. The monitoring team for live broadcasting consisted of about 400 members as of the date of
 this annual report, and we sometimes assign more team members from our general content screening team as necessary. The live broadcasting reviewing
 process is similar to the two-level review procedure described above. Further, in addition to responding to user complaints, our monitoring team
 frequently visit different live broadcasting rooms to ensure the appropriateness of the content.

       We utilize a real-name system to authenticate the identities of our content creators and live broadcasting hosts. In addition, before each upload, the
 user has agreed to the terms and conditions set forth in the user agreement of our platform. Pursuant to such user agreement, each user undertakes not to
 upload or distribute content that violates any PRC laws or regulations or infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, and agrees to
 indemnify us for all damages arising from third-party claims against us caused by violating or infringing content uploaded or linked by the user.
 Cooperation agreements with our popular content creators also provide for standard clauses that restrict the content creators from uploading infringing
 content on our platform. We also remove users’ uploads when we are notified or made aware by copyright owners or from other sources authorized by
 copyright owners of copyright infringements, such as lists of inappropriate or infringing content that the regulatory authorities publish from time to time
 and market information on releases of movies and television serial drama.

        Our abuse reporting infrastructure allows our users to report inappropriate, offensive or dangerous content to us through “report” links easily
 found on our platform. Users can also report through customer service staff or third-party organizations. In addition, if we confirm that user has
 uploaded content that contains provocative and hate speech, personal attacks, fraudulent information or other offensive information, we may temporarily
 suspend or permanently terminate such user’s account, and display such user’s account information and reason for the disciplinary action under the
 “Dark Chamber” tab, which is open to all users on our platform. To protect the community values and contribute to a more harmonious community, our
 veteran users have voluntarily formed a community discipline committee to collectively evaluate the appropriateness of content posted on our platform,
 the results of which will be used to train our AI system for content monitoring.

        However, there can be no assurance that we can identify all the videos or other content that may violate relevant laws and regulations due to the
 large amount of content uploaded by our users every day. As advised by our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, if the content of audio-visual programs
 transmitted by the internet audio-visual program service provider on the internet violate the PRC laws and regulations such as the Administrative
 Regulations on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service, the internet audio-visual program service provider may face, among others, warnings, fines,
 revocation of license and even criminal investigations or penalties. “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—
 Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.” If such content violates the Provisional Measures on Administration of Internet
 Culture, operating internet culture entities may face, among others, order to rectify, confiscation of illegal proceeds, fines, revocation of license and even
 criminal investigations or penalties. “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation— Regulations Related to Internet
 Cultural Activities.” The CAC conducted a nationwide inspection of major internet platforms providing short-video content, and we were notified by
 certain smartphone app stores in China that our mobile app had been temporarily removed from July 26, 2018 until August 25, 2018. We implemented
 the required measures promptly and reinstated the mobile app downloads from those app stores on August 26, 2018. We thereafter conducted a self-
 inspection by taking a comprehensive review of the content on our platform and have hired more content monitoring personnel. On December 3, 2020,
 in response to the reported vulgar content on our platform, the Shanghai Municipal Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal Publication, the Shanghai
 Municipal Internet Information Office and the Shanghai Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau made inquiries with us and requested us to rectify
 within two weeks and strengthen the content review of videos, live broadcasting, anime, bullet chatting and other content on our platform. We have
 completed the required rectification. We have submitted the final rectification report to the Shanghai Municipal Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal
 Publication and the Shanghai Municipal Internet Information Office on December 22, 2020 and our rectification report has been accepted by the
 relevant competent authorities, which indicates that the rectification has passed the review of relevant competent authority.

                                                                              83

        According to Notice 78, platforms providing online show live broadcasting or e-commerce live broadcasting services shall, among other things,
 register their information and business operations by November 30, 2020, ensure real-name registration for all live broadcasting hosts and virtual gifting
 users, prohibit users that are minors or without real-name registration from virtual gifting, and set a limit on the maximum amount of virtual gifting per
 time, per day, and per month.

       We have consulted with our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, as to the applicability and interpretation of the requirements under Notice 78 to
 our business, and conducted an internal evaluation of our compliance measures and status of compliance with the requirements under Notice 78. We
 have employed the following measures to comply with Notice 78 and ensure the appropriateness of live broadcasting content:
       (i) we have communicated with Shanghai Municipal Administration of Radio and Television, or the SHART and were informed that currently we
 are not required to register in this system;
       (ii) we have adopted policies to require real-name registration through identity card for all hosts from 2016, and require real-name registration
 through mobile number for all virtual gifting users from 2018;
        (iii) we have set up the youth mode from May 2019, under which users are prohibited from virtual gifting. Under the general mode, from early
 January 2021, the users who can be identified as minors are not allowed to make virtual gifts and if adult users can prove that the virtual gifts are paid by
 minors, they can claim for refund; our Youth Mode was established under the direction of the CAC, when an user launches our app for the first time
 every day, the user can switch to the Youth Mode according to the pop-up prompt, and the browsing content under the Youth Mode is presented in the
 form of whitelist by our content team, and parents can set up passcodes under the Youth Mode to manage the time spent by minors on our platform and
 to prevent minors from switching back to general mode. In addition to the Youth Mode which has been implemented on the platform, we have also
 launched the “Youth Firewall” program in April 2018 and co-established a “Minors’ Rights Protection Center” in May 2018 to adopt special content
 presentation policies and community permission settings for users who are not authenticated or whose identities are shown as minors, so as to strictly
 identify and filter undesirable information for minors. After consultation with our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, we confirm that the operation of
 content under the Youth Mode is compliant with PRC laws and regulations in all material aspects.
       (iv) with respect to the requirement of setting a cap on the amount of virtual gifting, as advised by our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm,
 currently there has been no explicit provisions on the standard for the maximum amount of virtual gifting under Notice 78. Since we have not received
 any notice or implementation guidance on setting such cap on virtual gifting, we have not been able to set such cap or quantify the impact of such
 requirement on our business operations and financial performance as of the date of this annual report. We intend to continue communicating with the
 NRTA and its local branches with respect to the standard for the maximum amount of virtual gifting. Once the NRTA provides specific implementation
 guidelines on the maximum amount of virtual gifting, we will be able to take measures to comply with the requirement on a timely basis; and
       (v) in relation to the other requirements under Notice 78, we believe that we have effective measures in place to ensure compliance with them in
 all material respects. However, given that certain requirements under Notice 78 remain unclear, we will continue communicating with regulatory
 authorities to seek more detailed guidelines with respect to the implementation of Notice 78.

                                                                              84

       As advised by our PRC counsel, Tian Yuan Law Firm, Notice 78 does not stipulate any timelines for full compliance with the requirements
 therein, nor any penalties for any non-compliance under Notice 78. We have not received any notice of enforcement actions nor have we been subject to
 any administrative penalties in connection with any non-compliance under Notice 78 as of the date of this annual report. For more information, see
 “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We face uncertainties with respect to the enactment,
 interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and Notice 3” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—
 Regulations Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”


 Corporate Social Responsibility
       Since our establishment, we have continued to fulfill our commitments to our users, employees and society, integrating the concepts of the
 environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) into our decision-making and development, and have continually communicated these goals to all
 stakeholders. We believe in technology to empower social good, upholding our long-term goal to develop technology and platform to create value for
 the society. We are dedicated to enriching the everyday life of young people, creating an outstanding community for our users, providing a platform for
 content creators to showcase their talent and promoting Chinese original content worldwide.

       We believe that quality content serves as an integral component of cultural development. We will continue to promote high quality and fulfilling
 content to fulfill our users’ cultural and entertainment needs. In 2021, over 190 million users accessed pan-knowledge content on our platform. We have
 established a traffic distribution mechanism to promote high-quality and original creations, providing a stage for content creators showcase their talents.
 To cultivate an engaging community has always been our top priority and embedded in our corporate value. We are committed to protecting data
 integrity and authenticity and creating a friendly and encouraging community for all of our users and content creators. Our content creators are essential
 to our thriving content ecosystem. We have cultivated a nourishing environment to allow content creators to grow and flourish on our platform,
 empowering them to realize commercialization opportunities and achieving self-actualization on our platform.

        On July 28, 2021, we published our first ESG Report. The report outlines our ESG policies and related outcomes and performance in 2020,
 underscoring the commitment to being a responsible public company, with a goal of bringing positive social and cultural impact to the world. In 2021,
 we established our ESG committee and a cross-departmental working group to promote sustainable development and continue to explore our social
 responsibilities, including supporting rural education, disaster relief and environmentally friendly initiatives. By 2021, to facilitate the rural education,
 we supported to build four Bilibili primary schools in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. In 2021, over 190,000 students benefited from Bilibili offline
 courses at schools, and over 2,400 users applied to be volunteer teachers in rural areas. During the pandemic, our content creators played a crucial role
 in circulating public information, contributing real-time data to promote public health knowledge on our platform. During the flood in Henan in July
 2021, we donated RMB20.0 million to the special funds of the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation in support of the emergency rescue operation
 in Henan. In January 2022, we launched our Bilibili Charity platform, an online public fundraising platform for charity organizations to further
 contribute to the greater good of society.

        Though our carbon footprint to the environment is limited as the majority of our operations are conducted online, we are a supporter of the Ten
 Principle of the United Nation’s Global Impact and United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and shoulder responsibilities to conduct
 carbon mitigation measures and will continue to explore ways to further improve energy efficiency. In 2021, we established our environmental
 management goals, to further facilitate the effective implementation of environmental protection practices. We proactively roll out the use of energy-
 efficient office facilities and encourage employees to conserve water, electricity, paper and office supplies. We pick business partners who share our
 strong commitment to carbon emission reduction. All our servers are compliant with industry energy efficiency standards in China. Leveraging our
 content ecosystem, we encourage everyone to participate to promote green culture through our videos and products, raising the public to environmental
 topics. In 2021, we had approximately 5.7 billion video views on our platform related to “environmental protection.”

       In line with the strengthened attention to climate change risks and opportunities worldwide and China’s call for reaching peak carbon emissions by
 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, we actively response and take the initiative to practice environmental responsibility. In 2021, in accordance with the
 recommendations of TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), we have assessed the impact of various climate change risks and
 propose countermeasures to provide guidance for green and low-carbon technology application, product innovation and operation optimization in the
 future. For identified climate change risks, we actively conduct survey on product and equipment procurement and prioritize cooperation with suppliers
 who have excellent performance on environmental protection and low carbon practice, covering green data center, green packing and green office
 decoration etc. For example, we prioritized to use low power usage effective (PUE) data centers suppliers. We actively assess our transition risks and
 disclose our governance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our annual ESG report.

                                                                               85

       We strictly comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of the countries and regions in which we operate and our securities are listed. We
 have devoted ourselves to establishing and maintaining risk management and internal control systems that covers financial reporting risk management,
 internal control risk management, data and technology system risk management and others. In particular, we attach great importance to cybersecurity
 and information security. We have established a corporate governance structure to clearly define responsibilities and to scientifically and efficiently
 manage our company. We have established internal cybersecurity polices to manage security risk, including the “Information Security Red Line
 (Preliminary Edition)”, “Cybersecurity Protocol,” and “Bilibili Data Security Management Protocols”. We have established a three-level information
 security management structure under the leadership of our board of directors. The security management committee is responsible for system
 construction and overall coordination. Our vice president of technology serves as the head of the committee and reports to the Chairman of the Board of
 Directors quarterly. The security management committee supervises the security working group to implement specific information security tasks,
 including monitor our day-to-day cybersecurity process, and timely remind and response to security incidents. The working group consists of internal
 security team, legal, public affairs and other related departments, as an internal and external security information transmission and cross-departmental
 cooperation.

        To reduce our cybersecurity risks, we have set up clear internal policies and red lines for our employees and ask suppliers to follow our
 stipulations for business engagements related to security risks and approaches for security incidents. In 2021, we further optimized our information
 security control process, and built a full-lifecycle technology application plan to prevent security incidents before happen, monitor and offer protection
 while occur, and trace them back to the source after occurrence. We regularly conduct self-inspection on information security and receive inspections
 from third party professional organizations. We also offer periodic training sessions to our employees to stay on the top of any regulatory and policy
 changes.

       To further implement our ESG initiatives, in addition to using the net proceeds from the offering of our December 2026 Notes for the enrichment
 of content offerings, research and development, and general corporate purposes, we will use an equivalent amount of such net proceeds to finance or
 refinance, in whole or in part, one or more of our new or existing ESG projects, including green building, energy efficient project and social impact
 projects under our Sustainable Finance Framework.


 Competition
        We compete primarily with companies that operate in the video-based industry in China designed to engage users, especially the Gen Z+, and
 capture their time spent on mobile devices and online. We compete to attract, engage and retain users, attract and retain talented content creators to
 improve and expand our content library and unique offerings and to attract and retain advertisers. Our competitors may compete with us in a variety of
 ways, including by leveraging a large user base to promote content offerings in different consumption scenarios, obtaining exclusive online distribution
 rights for popular content, conducting brand promotions and other marketing activities, and making acquisitions. We have exclusive distribution rights
 only for certain content on our platform. Our content creators are generally free to post their content on our competitors’ platforms, which may divert
 user traffic from our platform.

        We believe that we can compete effectively with our competitors on the basis of the following factors: (i) the strength and reputation of our brand,
 (ii) our ability to provide creative and quality PUGV, (iii) the demographic composition and engagement of our user base, (iv) the vibrant and inclusive
 community culture, (v) the performance and reliability of our platform, and (vi) our ability to develop new products and services and enhancements to
 existing products and services to keep up with user preferences and demands.

       Most of the players in the video-based industry are focused on one or two video content formats as their primary ways of engaging with users and
 deriving revenues. We do not view our value proposition to users, business model or our revenue streams as directly comparable with other market
 players, because we operate a unique business model of operating a full-spectrum video community that offers comprehensive content offerings across
 short and mid-to-long form videos, PUGV, live broadcasting, OGV, mobile games and others, all on one integrated platform. This commercialization
 model differentiates us from other vertical-focused video streaming companies, mobile game companies, live broadcasting companies or e-commerce
 companies.

      As we introduce new products and services on our platform, as our existing products continue to evolve, or as other companies introduce new
 products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.

                                                                             86

 Insurance
       We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate as we have in place all the mandatory insurance policies required by Chinese laws and
 regulations and in accordance with the commercial practices in our industry. Our employee-related insurance consists of pension insurance, maternity
 insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing funds, as required by Chinese laws and regulations.
 We also purchase supplemental commercial health insurance and accident insurance for our employees.

        In line with general market practice, we do not maintain insurance policies covering damages to our network infrastructures or information
 technology systems. We also do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain product
 liability insurance or key-man insurance.


 Regulation
       This section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in China or the rights of our
 shareholders to receive dividends and other distributions from us.


 Regulations Related to Foreign Investment in the PRC
       Foreign Investment Industrial Policy
       Investments activities in China by foreign investors are principally governed by the Catalogue for the Encouragement of Foreign Investment
 Industries (2020 Edition), or the Catalogue, and the Negative List (2021), which were both promulgated by the MOFCOM and the NDRC and each
 became effective on January 27, 2021 and January 1, 2022. The Catalogue and the Negative List (2021) set forth the industries in which foreign
 investments are encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Industries that are not listed in any of these three categories are generally open to foreign
 investment unless otherwise specifically restricted by other PRC rules and regulations.

       According to the Negative List (2021), the foreign equity interest ownership of entities that engage in value-added telecommunications business
 (except for e-commerce, domestic multi-party communication, storage and forwarding and call center) must not exceed 50%. In addition, foreign
 investments in the internet cultural business (except for music), the internet audio-visual program business, the radio and television program production
 and operation business, the production of audio-visual products and/or electronic publications and film production and distribution business are
 prohibited. However, foreign investors are allowed to hold up to 100% of equity interests in an online data processing and transaction processing
 business (including e-commerce business operation) in China.


       Foreign Investment Law and its Implementation Measures
        On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress of the PRC, or the NPC, enacted the 2019 FIL, which came into effect on January 1, 2020.
 The 2019 FIL has replaced the previous major laws and regulations governing foreign investment in the PRC, including the Sino-foreign Equity Joint
 Ventures Enterprises Law of the PRC, the Sino-foreign Co-operative Enterprises Law of the PRC and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law of
 the PRC. According to the Foreign Investment Law, “foreign-invested enterprises” refers to enterprises that are wholly or partly invested by foreign

 activities in China, including: (i) establishing foreign-invested enterprises in China either individually or jointly with other investors; (ii) obtaining stock
 shares, equity shares, shares in properties or other similar interests of Chinese domestic enterprises; (iii) investing in new projects in China either
 individually or jointly with other investors; and (iv) investing through other methods provided by laws, administrative regulations or provisions
 prescribed by the State Council.

                                                                               87
Table of Contents

        On December 26, 2019, the State Council issued Implementation Regulations for the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the Implementation
 Rules, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and replaced the Implementing Rules of the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures Enterprises Law of
 the PRC, the Implementing Rules of the Sino-foreign Co-operative Enterprises Law of the PRC and the Implementing Rules of the Wholly Foreign-
 invested Enterprise Law of the PRC. According to the Implementation Rules, in the event of any discrepancy between the Foreign Investment Law, the
 Implementation Rules and the relevant provisions on foreign investment promulgated prior to January 1, 2020, the Foreign Investment Law and the
 Implementation Rules shall prevail. The Implementation Rules also set forth that foreign investors that invest in sectors on the Negative List (2021) in
 which foreign investment is restricted shall comply with special management measures with respect to, among others, shareholding and senior
 management personnel qualification in the Negative List (2021). Pursuant to the Foreign Investment Law and the Implementation Rules, the existing
 foreign-invested enterprises established prior to the effective date of the Foreign Investment Law are allowed to keep their corporate organization forms
 for five years from the effectiveness of the Foreign Investment Law before such existing foreign-invested enterprises change their organization forms
 and organization structures in accordance with the PRC Company Law, the Partnership Enterprise Law of the PRC and other applicable laws.

       On December 30, 2019, the MOFCOM and the SAMR jointly promulgated the Measures on Reporting of Foreign Investment Information, which
 came into effect on January 1, 2020, and has replaced the Interim Measures for the Administration of Record-filling on the Establishment and Changes
 in Foreign-Invested Enterprises. Foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information to the commerce administrative
 authorities through the Enterprise Registration System and the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.

        On December 19, 2020, the NDRC and the MOFCOM jointly promulgated the Measures on the Security Review of Foreign Investment, effective
 on January 18, 2021, setting forth provisions concerning the security review mechanism on foreign investment, including the types of investments
 subject to review, review scopes and procedures, among others. The Office of the Working Mechanism of the Security Review of Foreign Investment, or
 the Office of the Working Mechanism, will be established under the NDRC, who will lead the task together with the MOFCOM. Foreign investor or
 relevant parties in China must declare the security review to the Office of the Working Mechanism prior to (i) the investments in the military industry,
 military industrial supporting and other fields relating to the security of national defense, and investments in areas surrounding military facilities and
 military industry facilities; and (ii) investments in important agricultural products, important energy and resources, important equipment manufacturing,
 important infrastructure, important transport services, important cultural products and services, important information technology and Internet products
 and services, important financial services, key technologies and other important fields relating to national security, and obtain control in the target
 enterprise. Control exists when the foreign investor (i) holds over 50% equity interests in the target, (ii) has voting rights that can materially impact on
 the resolutions of the board of directors or shareholders meeting of the target even when it holds less than 50% equity interests in the target, or (iii) has
 material impact on target’s business decisions, human resources, accounting and technology.


 Regulations Related to Value-Added Telecommunications Services
        In 2000, the State Council promulgated the Telecommunications Regulations of the PRC, or the Telecommunications Regulations, most recently
 amended in February 2016, which provide the regulatory framework for telecommunications service providers in China and require a
 telecommunications service provider to obtain an operating license prior to commencing its operations. The Telecommunications Regulations categorize
 all telecommunications services as either basic telecommunications services or value-added telecommunications services. Providers of value-added
 telecommunications services are required to obtain a license for value-added telecommunications services. Pursuant to the Catalog of
 Telecommunications Services, an attachment to the Telecommunications Regulations, which was most recently amended on June 6, 2019, information
 services provided via public telecommunication network or the internet fall within value-added telecommunications services.

        The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or the Internet Information Services Measures, which was promulgated by the
 State Council on September 25, 2000, and amended on January 8, 2011, set out guidelines on the provision of internet information services. According
 to the Internet Information Services Measures, the internet information services is classified into commercial internet information services and
 non-commercial internet information services; a commercial operator of internet content provision services must obtain an ICP License for the provision
 of internet information services from the appropriate telecommunications authorities. The Administrative Measures for Telecommunications Businesses
 Operating Permits, which was promulgated by the MIIT on July 3, 2017, and became effective on September 1, 2017, further regulates the
 telecommunications business permits. On January 8, 2021, the CAC promulgated the Internet Information Services Measures (Revised Draft for
 Comments), which sets forth detailed rules on the internet information service activities. As of the date of this annual report, the draft has not been
 formally adopted.

                                                                              88

 Regulations Related to Internet Cultural Activities
        On February 17, 2011, the MOC promulgated the Provisional Measures on Administration of Internet Culture, or the Internet Culture Provisions,
 effective on April 1, 2011, and amended on December 15, 2017, to regulate entities that engage in activities related to internet cultural products.
 “Internet cultural products” are classified as cultural products developed, published and disseminated via internet which mainly include: (i) online
 cultural products particularly developed for publishing via internet, such as, among other things, online music and entertainment, online games and
 online shows and programs, online performance, online artwork and online anime and cartoons; and (ii) online cultural products converted from music
 and entertainment, games, shows and programs, performance, artwork, anime and cartoons using certain technical means to be disseminated via internet.
 Pursuant to these regulations, entities are required to obtain the Online Culture Operating Permits from the applicable provincial level counterpart of the
 MCT if they intend to commercially engage in any of the following types of activities: (i) production, duplication, import, release or broadcasting of
 online cultural products; (ii) publishing of online cultural products on the internet or transmission over information network, such as internet or mobile
 telecommunication network, to end user’s devices via computers, fixed-line or mobile phones, radios, television sets or online games consoles and

 Regulations Related to Online Games
       Regulatory Authorities
       Pursuant to the Notice on Issuing the Provisions on the Main Functions, Internal Bodies and Staffing of the General Administration of Press and
 Publication (National Copyright Administration) promulgated by the General Office of the State Council on July 11, 2008, the Notice of the State
 Commission Office for Public Sector Reform on Interpretation of the State Commission Office for Public Sector Reform on Several Provisions relating

 game shall be conducted by the MOC, and the GAPP is responsible for the examination and approval process of online games prior to online
 publication. After the online games uploaded on the internet, online games will be administered by the MCT. Moreover, if an online game is launched
 on the internet without the prior approval of the GAPP, the MCT will be responsible for guiding the cultural market law enforcement team to conduct
 investigation and punishment. In March 2013, the SAPPRFT formed based on the Notice on the Institutional Reform issued by the State Council.

        In March 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the Plan for Deepening the Institutional Reform of the Party and
 State and the NPC promulgated the Decision of the First Session of the Thirteenth National People’s Congress on the State Council Institutional Reform
 Proposal (collectively, the “Institutional Reform Plans”). According to the Institutional Reform Plans, effective from March 21, 2018, the SAPPRFT
 was reformed and now known as the NRTA under the State Council, and the responsibility of the SAPPRFT for administration of news, publication and
 films, such as the approval of online game registrations and issuance of game publication numbers has been transferred to the NAPP under the
 Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The NAPP at the national level suspended approval of game
 registration and issuance of publication numbers for online games since March 2018 and resumed to issue game publication numbers by batches
 periodically since December 2018, according to certain news reports. Beginning in December 2018, the NAPP at the national level started to approve
 new online games.

 Measures for the Administration of Online Games and the Administrative Measures for Tourism Development Plan, or the Abolition Decision. The
 Abolition Decision also cites the Function Configuration Regulations and further abolishes the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online
 Games, or the Online Game Measures, which means that the MCT will no longer regulate the industry of online games. As of the date of this annual
 report, no laws, regulations or official guidelines have been promulgated regarding whether the responsibility of MCT for regulating online games will
 be undertaken by another governmental department.

                                                                            91

 between virtual transactions and real transactions carried out by way of electronic commerce. The Online Games Notice further provides that virtual
 currency must only be used to purchase virtual items and prohibits any resale of virtual currency.

        On June 4, 2009, the MOC and the MOFCOM jointly issued the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Virtual Currency of Online Games, or
 the Virtual Currency Notice. According to the Virtual Currency Notice, it defines the meaning of the term “virtual currency” and places a set of
 restrictions on the trading and issuance of virtual currency. The Virtual Currency Notice also states that online game operators are also not allowed to
 give out virtual items or virtual currency through lottery-base activities, such as lucky draws, betting or random computer sampling, in exchange for

       Anti-addiction System and Protection of Minors
        In March 2007, the GAPP and several other government agencies issued a circular requiring the implementation of an anti-fatigue system and a
 real-name registration system by all PRC online game operators to curb addictive online game playing by minors. To identify whether a game player is a
 minor and thus subject to the anti-fatigue system, a real-name registration system must be adopted to require online game players to register with their
 real identity information before playing online games. The online game operators are also required to submit the identity information of game players to
 the public security authority for verification.

       In July 2011, the GAPP, together with several other government agencies, jointly issued the Notice on Initializing the Verification of Real-name
 Registration for the Anti-Fatigue System on Online Games, or the Real-name Registration Notice, in order to strengthen the implementation of the anti-
 fatigue and real-name registration system. This notice indicates that the National Citizen Identity Information Center of the MPS will verify identity
 information of game players submitted by online game operators. The Real-name Registration Notice also imposes stringent penalties on online game
 operators that do not implement the required anti-fatigue and real-name registration systems properly and effectively, including terminating their online
 game operations.

        In 2011, the MOC, together with several other government agencies, jointly issued a Circular on Printing and Distributing Implementation
 Scheme regarding Parental Guardianship Project for Minors Playing Online Games to strengthen the administration of online games and protect the
 legitimate rights and interests of minors.

       This circular indicates that online game operators must have person in charge, set up specific service webpages and publish specific hotlines to
 provide parents with necessary assistance to prevent or restrict minors’ improper game playing behavior.

        On October 25, 2019, the NAPP issued the Notice on Preventing Minors from Indulging in Online Games which took effect on November 1,
 2019. The Notice stipulates several requirements on the online game operation, including but not limited to: (i) all online game users shall register their
 game accounts with valid identity information; (ii) the time slot and duration for playing online games by minors shall be strictly controlled; (iii) the
 provision of paid services to minors shall be regulated; (iv) the regulation of the industry shall be enhanced and the requirements above shall be requisite
 for launching, publishing and operating online games; and (v) the development and implementation of an age-appropriate reminding system shall be
 explored. Online game companies shall analyze the cause of minors’ addiction to games, and alter the content and features of games or game rules
 resulting in such addiction.

       On October 17, 2020, the SCNPC revised and promulgated the Law of the PRC on the Protection of Minors (2020 Revision), which took effect on
 June 1, 2021. Law of the PRC on the Protection of Minors (2020 Revision) added a new section entitled “Online Protections” which stipulates a series
 of provisions to further protect minors’ interests on the internet, among others, (i) online product and service providers are prohibited from providing
 minors with products and services that would induce minors to indulge, (ii) online service providers for products and services such as online games, live
 broadcasting, audio-video, and social networking are required to establish special management systems of user duration, access authority and
 consumption for minors, (iii) online games service providers must request minors to register and log into online games with their valid identity
 information, (iv) online games service providers must categorize games according to relevant rules and standards, notify users about the appropriate

 games service providers may not provide online games services to minors from 10:00 P.M. to 8:00 A.M. the next day. As of the date of this annual
 report, we have implemented a real-name registration system and a Bilibili game health system in our mobile game platform in accordance with the
 relevant supervision requirements. These two systems include, among others, following measures:
       (i)    the real-name registration system requires users to register with valid identity information and the users without real-name authentication
              will not be able to log into the game after 1 hour’s trial playing in visitor experience mode for 15 days;

                                                                             93

       (ii)    the users are not allowed to top up or purchase game virtual items in visitor experience mode;
       (iii)   the accumulated time of minors playing game each day is monitored, calculated and limited to less than three hours per day on PRC

       (v)     consumption limits for minors have been implemented as required by the relevant regulatory guidance.

        On August 30, 2021, the NAPP promulgated the Notice on Further Strict Management to Effectively Prevent Minors from Being Addicted to
 Online Games, which became effective on September 1, 2021. The notice requires that all online games enterprises including platforms providing online
 game services may only provide online game services to minors for one hour from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. each day on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and
 national holidays, and may not provide online game services to minors in any form at any other time. All online games must be connected to the real-
 name verification system of the NAPP for online games to prevent addiction, all online game users must use real and valid identity information to
 register their game accounts and log in to online games, and online games enterprises must not provide online game services in any form (including
 visitor experience mode) to users who have not registered and logged in with their real names.

                                                                              94

        According to the Notice on Strengthening the Management of Online Show Live Broadcasting and E-commerce Live Broadcasting promulgated
 by the NRTA on November 12, 2020, live broadcasting platforms for online shows are requested to strengthen positive value guidance and enable those
 tasteful, meaningful, interesting and warm live-broadcasting programs to have good traffic, and to prevent the spread of the trends of wealth flaunting,
 money worshiping and vulgarity. In addition, the number of content reviewers a platform is required to keep must in principle be no less than 1:50 of the
 number of live broadcasting rooms. Live broadcasting platforms for online shows need to manage the hosts and “virtual gifting” users based on the real-
 name registration system, and users who have not registered with real names or who are minors are prohibited from virtual gifting. The live broadcasting
 platforms are required to implement real-name registration system by real-name verification, face recognition, manual review and other measures to
 prevent minors from virtual gifting. The platform shall limit the maximum amount of virtual gifting each user may give per time, day and month. Live
 broadcasting platforms for e-commerce shall not illegally produce and broadcast, beyond their business scope of e-commerce, any commentary
 programs unrelated to sales of goods.

         In February 2021, the CAC and certain other governmental authorities issued Notice 3, according to which, online live broadcasting platforms
 providing online live broadcasting information services shall strictly abide by laws, regulations and regulatory requirements of the PRC, and shall

 complete out ICP filing; live broadcasting platforms that carry out online audio-visual program services shall hold a License for Online Transmission of
 Audio-Visual Programs (or complete registration with the National Internet Audio-visual Platforms Information Management System) and complete ICP

 of illegal and non-compliant information and a hierarchical classification system shall be established and regularly enriched and expanded to improve
 the efficiency and quality of technical review.

       The CAC launched a “Fan Group Chaos Rectification” special action on June 15, 2021, followed by the issuance of the Notice on Further
 Strengthening the Management of Chaos in Fan Groups on August 25, 2021. Both of the special action and notice are intended to rectify chaos in online
 fan groups for celebrities, specifically, in features such as celebrity rankings, hot topics, fan communities, and fans interactive functions, so as to curb
 verbal abuse, stigmatization, instigation, confrontation, insults, slander, rumors, malicious marketing and the spread of other harmful information. This
 notice requested, among other things, the cancellation of all rankings of celebrities. The rankings of music, film and television works are still allowed,
 but the network platforms should optimize and adjust ranking rules to focus on the art works themselves and professional evaluation. Furthermore,
 minors are not allowed to make virtual gifting or spending money on supporting idols, or act as the organizer or manager of a fan group.

        On October 26, 2021, the OCCAC issued the Notice on Further Strengthening the Regulation on Online Information of Entertainment Celebrities,

 if such data are tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or illegally used. The appropriate level of protection measures is required to be
 taken for each respective category of data. For example, a processor of important data is required to designate the personnel and the management body
 responsible for data security, carry out risk assessments of its data processing activities and file the risk assessment reports with the competent
 authorities. State core data, i.e., data having a bearing on national security, the lifelines of national economy, people’s key livelihood and major public
 interests, shall be subject to stricter management system. Moreover, the Data Security Law provides a national security review procedure for those data
 processing activities which affect or may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data and information. In addition, the Data
 Security Law also provides that any organization or individual within the territory of the PRC shall not provide any foreign judicial body and law
 enforcement body with any data stored within the territory of the PRC without the approval of the competent PRC governmental authorities.

 the critical information infrastructure operators only, but the Measures for the Security Assessment of Outbound Data (Draft for Comments) has
 extended the security assessment obligation to all data processors, and provides two types of security assessment to be undertaken before providing data
 from China to overseas, namely risk self-assessment and security assessment by CAC. As of the date of this annual report, the Measures for the Security
 Assessment of Outbound Data (Draft for Comments) has not been formally adopted.

        On November 14, 2021, the CAC published the Regulations of Internet Data Security Management (Draft for Comments), which further regulate
 the internet data processing activities and emphasize the supervision and management of network data security, and further stipulate the obligations of
 internet platform operators, such as to establish a system for disclosure of platform rules, privacy policies and algorithmic strategies related to data, and
 timely disclosure of formulation procedures and adjudication procedures and more. Specifically, the draft regulations require data processors to, among
 others, (i) adopt immediate remediation measures when finding that network products and services they use or provide have security defects and
 vulnerabilities, or threaten national security or endanger public interest, and (ii) follow a series of detailed requirements with respect to processing of
 personal information, management of important data and proposed overseas transfer of data. In addition, such draft regulations require data processors
 handling important data or the data processors listed overseas to complete an annual data security assessment and file a data security assessment report
 to applicable regulators. Such annual assessment, as required by the draft regulations, would encompass areas including but not limited to the status of
 important data processing, data security risks identified and the measures adopted, the effectiveness of data protection measures, the implementation of
 national data security laws and regulations, data security incidents that occurred and their handling, and a security assessment with respect to sharing

 Regulations Related to Anti-Unfair Competition and Anti-Monopoly
       According to the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC, or the Anti-Unfair Competition Law, which was adopted by the SCNPC on
 September 2, 1993, became effective as of December 1, 1993, and last amended on April 23, 2019, unfair competition refers to that the operator disrupts
 the market competition order and damages the legitimate rights and interests of other operators or consumers in violation of the provisions of the Anti-
 unfair Competition Law in the production and operating activities. Pursuant to the Anti-unfair Competition Law, operators shall abide by the principle of
 voluntariness, equality, impartiality, integrity and adhere to laws and business ethics during market transactions. Operators in violation of the Anti-unfair
 Competition Law shall bear corresponding civil, administrative or criminal liabilities depending on the specific circumstances.

       The Anti-monopoly Law of the PRC promulgated by the SCNPC, which became effective on August 1, 2008, and the Rules of the State Council
 on Declaration Threshold for Concentration of Undertakings promulgated by the State Council on August 3, 2008, and latest amended on September 18,
 2018, require that where a concentration reaches one of the following thresholds, a declaration must be lodged in advance with the anti-monopoly law
 enforcement agency under the State Council, or otherwise the concentration shall not be implemented: (i) during the previous fiscal year, the total global
 turnover of all undertakings participating in the concentration exceeded RMB10 billion, and at least two of these undertakings each had a turnover of
 more than RMB400 million within China; or(ii) during the previous fiscal year, the total turnover within China of all the undertakings participating in
 the concentration exceeded RMB2 billion, and at least two of these undertakings each had a turnover of more than RMB400 million within China. On
 October 23, 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the draft amendment on Anti-monopoly Law for public comments, which significantly increased the
 penalties for violation of anti-monopoly law, introduced a “safe harbor” for anti-competitive agreements that have a market share lower than a specific
 threshold to be set by SAMR, granted SAMR the power to suspend the review period in merger investigations under specified circumstances, and
 allowed public prosecutors to bring a civil public interest lawsuit based on monopolistic behaviours. This draft emphasized on the enforcement of anti-
 monopoly laws in the internet, finance and other key industries. As of the date of this annual report, the draft amendment on Anti-monopoly Law has not
 been formally adopted.

                                                                             103

       On October 23, 2020, the SAMR further issued the Interim Provisions on Examination and Approval of Concentration of Business Operators, or
 the Examination Provisions, which became effective on December 1, 2020. According to the Examination Measures, concentration refers to (i) a merger
 of undertakings; (ii) acquiring control over other undertakings by acquiring equities or assets; or (iii) acquisition of control over, or the possibility of
 exercising decisive influence on, an undertaking by contract or by any other means.

        In February 2021, the Anti-monopoly Commission of the State Council published the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform
 Economy Sector, which provides that the calculation of turnover in the field of platform economy may be different depending on the business model of
 the operators: for platform operators who only provide information matchings and collect commissions, their turnovers should be calculated including
 the service fee charged by the platform and other platform income; for the platform operators who participate in the market competition on the platform
 side, their turnovers shall be calculated including the transaction amount involved in the platform and other platforms. The concentration of
 undertakings involving the agreement control (VIE) structure falls within the scope of the antitrust review of concentration of undertakings. Where the
 concentration of undertakings meets the declaration standards set by the State Council, the operators shall declare to the anti-monopoly law enforcement
 agency of the State Council in advance, and the concentration shall not be implemented if the concentration is not declared. According to the currently
 effective Anti-Monopoly Law of the PRC, if business operators fail to comply with the mandatory declaration requirement, the anti-monopoly authority
 is empowered to order to terminate and/or unwind the transaction, dispose of relevant assets, shares or businesses within certain periods, adopt other
 necessary measures to reinstate the pre-concentration status and impose fines of up to RMB500,000.

 Regulations Related to Taxation
       EIT
        According to the EIT Law, which was promulgated on March 16, 2007, came into effect on January 1, 2008, and last amended on December 29,
 2018, and the Implementation Regulations on the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which was promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007, came

 25% will be applied to resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises that have established production and operation facilities in China. Besides
 enterprises established within the PRC, enterprises established in accordance with the laws of other judicial districts whose “de facto management
 bodies” are within the PRC are considered “resident enterprises” and subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate for their global income. A
 non-resident enterprise refers to an entity established under foreign law whose “de facto management bodies” are not within the PRC but which have an
 establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but have income sourced within
 the PRC. An income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to or any other gains realized on the transfer of shares by
 non-PRC resident enterprise investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of
 business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from
 sources within the PRC.

                                                                             104
Table of Contents

        According to the Arrangement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion between the mainland of China and Hong Kong entered
 into between the mainland of China and the HKSAR on August 21, 2006, if the non-PRC parent company of a PRC enterprise is a Hong Kong resident
 which directly owns 25% or more of the equity interest pf the PRC foreign-invested enterprise which pays the dividends and interests, the 10%
 withholding tax rate applicable under the EIT Law may be lowered to 5% for dividends and 7% for interest payments if a Hong Kong resident enterprise
 is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance
 Arrangement and other applicable laws. However, according to the Notice on the Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions
 in Tax Treaties, which was promulgated by the STA on February 20, 2009, and came into effect on the same date, if the relevant PRC tax authorities
 determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits unjustifiably from such reduced income tax rate due to a transaction or arrangement that is
 primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment; and based on the Announcement of the Certain Issues with
 Respect to the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, issued by the STA on February 3, 2018, and effective on April 1, 2018, if an applicant’s business
 activities do not constitute substantive business activities, it could result in the negative determination of the applicant’s status as a “beneficial owner,”
 and consequently, the applicant could be precluded from enjoying the above-mentioned reduced income tax rate of 5% under the Double Tax Avoidance
 Arrangement.


       VAT
       The Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax, which was promulgated on December 13, 1993, came into effect on January 1, 1994, last
 amended on November 19, 2017, and the Detailed Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax, which was promulgated on
 December 18, 2008, and amended on October 28, 2011, came into effect on November 1, 2011, set out that all taxpayers selling goods or providing
 processing, repairing or replacement labor services, sales of services, intangible assets and immovable assets and importing goods in China shall pay a
 value-added tax.

        The State Council approved, and the STA and the MOF officially launched a pilot value-added tax reform program starting from January 1, 2012,
 or the Pilot Program, applicable to businesses in selected industries. Businesses in the Pilot Program would pay value-added tax instead of business tax.
 The Pilot Program was initiated in Shanghai, then further applied to 10 additional regions such as Beijing and Guangdong province. On November 19,
 2017, the State Council promulgated the Decisions on Abolishing the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Business Tax and Amending the
 Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax, according to which, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, the provision
 of processing, repairing and replacement labor services, sales of services, intangible assets, real property and the importation of goods within the
 territory of the PRC are the taxpayers of value-added tax. The value-added tax rates generally applicable are simplified as 17%, 11%, 6% and 0%, and
 the value-added tax rate applicable to the small-scale taxpayers is 3%. According to the Notice of the MOF and the STA on Adjusting Value added Tax
 Rates, issued on April 4, 2018, and became effective on May 1, 2018, the deduction rates of 17% and 11% applicable to the taxpayers who have value-
 added tax taxable sales activities or imported goods are adjusted to 16% and 10%, respectively. According to the Notice of the MOF, the STA and the
 General Administration of Customs on Relevant Policies for Deepening Value Added Tax Reform, issued on March 20, 2019, and became effective on
 April 1, 2019, the value added tax rate was reduced to 13% and 9%, respectively.

 Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange Control
       The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Regulation on the Foreign Exchange Control of PRC,
 promulgated by the State Council on January 29, 1996, came into effect on April 1, 1996, and last amended on August 5, 2008, and the Regulations on
 the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement, Sale and Payment, promulgated by the People’s Bank of China in June 1996 and came into effect
 on July 1, 1996, according to which, Renminbi for current account items is freely convertible, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments,
 trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans and investments in securities
 outside of the PRC, unless the prior approval or record-filing of the SAFE or its local counterpart is obtained.

       The Circular on Reforming the Management Method regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or the
 Circular 19, promulgated on March 30, 2015, came into effective on June 1, 2015, and last amended on December 30, 2019, allows foreign-invested
 enterprises to make equity investments by using RMB fund converted from foreign exchange capital. Under the Circular 19, the foreign exchange
 capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises upon the confirmation of rights and interests of monetary contribution by the local foreign
 exchange bureau (or the book-entry registration of monetary contribution by the banks) can be settled at the banks based on the actual operation needs of
 the enterprises. The proportion of willingness-based foreign exchange settlement of capital for foreign-invested enterprises is temporarily set at 100%.
 The SAFE can adjust such proportion in due time based on the circumstances of the international balance of payments. However, Circular 19 and the
 Circular on Reforming and Regulating the Management Policies on the Settlement of Capital Projects, promulgated on June 9, 2016, continues to
 prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its
 business scope, investing and financing directly or indirectly in securities and other investments except for bank’s principal-secured products, providing
 loans to non-affiliated enterprises or constructing or purchasing real estate not for self-use.

       On October 23, 2019, the SAFE released the Circular on Further Promoting Cross-border Trade and Investment Facilitation, or the Circular 28,
 according to which besides foreign-invested enterprises engaged in investment business, non-investment foreign-invested enterprises are also permitted
 to make domestic equity investments with their capital funds in foreign currency provided that such investments do not violate the Negative List
 (2021) and the target investment projects are genuine and in compliance with laws. According to the Circular on Optimizing Administration of Foreign
 Exchange to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business, issued by the SAFE on April 10, 2020, eligible enterprises are allowed to make
 domestic payments by using their capital funds, foreign credits and the income under capital accounts of overseas listing, without submitting the
 evidentiary materials concerning authenticity of such capital for banks in advance; provided that their capital use is authentic and in compliance with
 administrative regulations on the use of income under capital accounts. The bank in charge shall conduct post spot checking in accordance with the
 relevant requirements.

        According to the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive
 Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies, which was promulgated by SAFE in February 2012, PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens residing in China
 for a continuous period of not less than one year (except for foreign diplomatic personnel in China and representatives of international organizations in
 China) who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company shall, through the domestic company to which the said
 company is affiliated, collectively entrust a domestic agency (may be the Chinese affiliate of the overseas publicly listed company which participates in
 stock incentive plan, or other domestic institutions qualified for asset trust business lawfully designated by such company) to handle foreign exchange
 registration, and entrust an overseas institution to handle issues like exercise of options, purchase and sale of corresponding stocks or equity and transfer
 of corresponding funds. In addition, the domestic agency is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is
 any material change to the stock incentive plan.

        The SAFE Circular 37, promulgated by the SAFE on July 4, 2014, and came into effective on the same date, states that (i) a PRC resident,
 including a PRC resident natural person or a PRC legal person, shall register with the local branch of the SAFE before it contributes its assets or equity
 interest in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests into a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of investment and financing; and (ii) when
 the special purpose vehicle undergoes change of basic information, such as change in PRC resident natural person shareholder, name or operating
 period, or occurrence of a material event, such as change in share capital of a PRC resident natural person, performance of merger or split, the PRC
 resident shall register such change with the local branch of the SAFE in a timely manner. According to the SAFE Circular 13 which was promulgated by
 SAFE on February 13, 2015, came effective on June 1, 2015, and amended on December 30, 2019, banks are required to review and carry out foreign
 exchange registration under offshore direct investment directly. The SAFE and its branches shall implement indirect supervision over foreign exchange
 registration of direct investment via the banks.

                                                                             106

 Regulations Related to Dividend Distributions
       The principal laws and regulations regulating the dividend distribution of dividends by foreign-invested enterprises in China include the PRC
 Company Law last amended in 2018 and the Foreign Investment Law. Under the current regulatory regime in the PRC, foreign-invested enterprises in
 the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. A
 PRC company, including foreign-invested enterprise, is required to set aside as general reserves at least 10% of its after-tax profit, until the cumulative
 amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its registered capital unless the provisions of laws regarding foreign investment otherwise provided, and shall
 not distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together
 with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.


 Regulations Related to M&A and Overseas Listings
       The M&A Rules was jointly promulgated by six PRC governmental authorities including the MOFCOM, the STA, the SAFE, the SAMR, the
 State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council and the CSRC on August 8, 2006, and amended on June 22, 2009.
 Foreign investors must comply with the M&A Rules when they purchase equity interests of a domestic company or subscribe the increased capital of a
 domestic company, and thus changing of the nature of the domestic company into a foreign-invested enterprise; or when the foreign investors establish a
 foreign-invested enterprise in China, purchase the assets of a domestic company and operate the asset; or when the foreign investors purchase the assets
 of a domestic company by agreement, establish a foreign-invested enterprise by injecting such assets, and operate the assets. According to Article 11 of
 the M&A Rules, where a domestic enterprise, or a domestic natural person, through an overseas company established or controlled by it/him/her,
 acquires a domestic enterprise which is related to or connected with it/him/her, approval from the MOFCOM is required. The M&A Rules, among other
 things, further purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC
 companies or individuals, shall obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle acquires shares of or
 equity interests in the PRC companies in exchange for the shares of offshore companies.

       On April 2, 2022, the CSRC promulgated Provisions on Strengthening the Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities
 Issuance and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments), according to which, a domestic company that plans to, either directly or through its
 overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant entities or individuals including securities companies, securities service providers, and
 overseas regulators, documents and materials that contain state secrets or government work secrets, shall first obtain approval from competent
 authorities according to law, and file with the secrecy administrative department at the same level. A domestic company that plans to, either directly or
 through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant entities or individuals including securities companies, securities service
 providers, and overseas regulators, other documents and materials that, if divulged, will jeopardize national security or public interest, shall strictly fulfil
 relevant procedures stipulated by applicable national regulations. Archives, including working papers, that have been produced in the Chinese mainland
 by securities companies and securities service providers for overseas securities offering and listing by domestic companies shall be retained in the
 Chinese mainland, and, without prior approval by competent authorities, must not be brought, mailed or otherwise transferred to outside the Chinese
 mainland, or transmitted to any institutions or individuals outside the Chinese mainland through any methods including via the use of information
 technologies. Overseas securities regulators and competent overseas authorities may request to investigate, including to collect evidence for
 investigation purpose, or inspect a domestic company that has been listed or offered securities in an overseas market or securities companies and
 securities service providers that undertake securities business for such domestic companies. Such investigation and inspection shall be conducted under
 a cross-border regulatory cooperation mechanism, and the CSRC and competent authorities of the Chinese government will provide necessary assistance
 pursuant to bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms. Before cooperating with the investigation and inspection by, or providing documents and
 materials to overseas securities regulators or other competent overseas authorities, such domestic companies, securities companies and securities service
 providers shall report to the CSRC or other competent authorities. As of the date of this document, this draft has not been formally adopted and the final
 version and effective date of such measures are subject to change with substantial uncertainty.

                                                                               107

 C.       Organizational Structure
       The following chart illustrates our company’s organizational structure, including our principal subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities as of
 the date of this annual report:




 Notes:
 (1)   Mr. Rui Chen holds 100% equity interests in Shanghai Kuanyu. He is also the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer.
 (2)   Shanghai Kuanyu has four subsidiaries.
 (3)   Mr. Rui Chen, Mr. Yi Xu and Ms. Ni Li hold 52.3%, 44.3%, and 3.4% equity interests in Hode Information Technology, respectively, as of the date of this annual report. Mr. Chen is
       our controlling shareholder, the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer. Mr. Xu is our founder, director and president. Ms. Li is the vice chairwoman of our
       board of directors and chief operating officer.
 (4)   Hode Information Technology has 35 subsidiaries.
 (5)   Chaodian Technology has entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Chaodian Culture and its individual shareholders, through which we obtained control over the
       operations of, and enjoyed all economic benefits of Chaodian Culture. Mr. Rui Chen, Mr. Yi Xu, Ms. Ni Li, Mr. Xujun Chai, Shanghai Kuanyu and Hode Information Technology hold
       31.2%, 9.5%, 6.8%, 5.1%, 44.6% and 2.8% equity interests in Chaodian Culture, respectively, as of the date of this annual report. Mr. Xujun Chai is an employee of our company.

                                                                                             108

 Contractual Arrangements with the Relevant VIEs and their Respective Individual Shareholders
       Reasons for Adopting the Contractual Arrangements
       Our (i) internet audio-visual program services, (ii) radio and television program production and operation business, and (iii) internet cultural
 business that are currently conducted by Shanghai Kuanyu and Hode Information Technology (collectively, the “principal VIEs”), Shanghai Hehehe
 Culture Communication Co., Ltd., or “Shanghai Hehehe”, Sharejoy Network Technology Co., Ltd., or “Sharejoy Network”, and Shanghai Anime
 Tamashi Cultural Media Co., Ltd., or “Shanghai Anime Tamashi” (collectively with Shanghai Hehehe and Sharejoy Network, the “Major VIE
 Subsidiaries”), and Chaodian Culture are considered as “prohibited” under the Negative List (2021) where foreign investment is strictly prohibited
 (collectively, the “Prohibited Business”). Our internet information services operated by the principal VIEs, Sharejoy Network and Shanghai Hehehe is
 considered as “restricted” under the Negative List (2021) where the foreign investors are restricted from holding more than 50% equity interests in the
 companies providing such services (the “Restricted Business,” together with the Prohibited Business, the “Relevant Business”). Since investment in the
 Relevant Businesses in which the principal VIEs, Major VIE Subsidiaries and Chaodian Culture currently operate are subject to the restrictions under
 the current PRC laws and regulations, as advised by our PRC counsel, we determined that it was not viable for our company to hold the principal VIEs,
 Major VIE Subsidiaries and Chaodian Culture directly through equity ownership. Instead, we decided that, in line with common practice in industries in
 the PRC subject to foreign investment restrictions, we would gain effective control over, and have the right to receive all the economic benefits
 generated by the Relevant Businesses which are currently operated by the principal VIEs, Major VIE Subsidiaries and Chaodian Culture through the
 contractual arrangements between Hode Shanghai and Chaodian Technology, which are PRC subsidiaries of our company, on the one hand, and the
 principal VIEs, Chaodian Culture and their respective individual shareholders, on the other hand. We believe that these contractual arrangements are fair
 and reasonable because: (i) they were freely negotiated and entered into by the contracting parties; (ii) by entering into the exclusive business
 cooperation agreements with Hode Shanghai and Chaodian Technology, the principal VIEs and Chaodian Culture, as applicable, will enjoy better
 economic and technical support from us and better market reputation; and (iii) a number of other companies use similar arrangements to accomplish the
 same purpose.

        The following is a summary of the currently effective contractual arrangements (i) by and among our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hode Shanghai,
 the principal VIEs and their respective shareholders, and (ii) by and among Chaodian Technology, Chaodian Culture and the individual shareholders of
 Chaodian Culture. These contractual arrangements enable us to (i) exercise effective control over the relevant VIEs; (ii) receive substantially all of the
 economic benefits of the relevant VIEs; and (iii) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in and assets of them when and to
 the extent permitted by PRC law.

                                                                             109

       12.    if Mr. Rui Chen or Shanghai Kuanyu fails to perform the tax obligations under applicable laws and results in obstacles for Hode Shanghai
              to exercise its exclusive option right, Shanghai Kuanyu or Mr. Rui Chen shall pay the taxes or pay the same amount to Hode Shanghai so

        We have also entered into contractual arrangements with several other affiliated entities and their respective nominee shareholders through some
 of our subsidiaries other than Hode Shanghai or Chaodian Technology, which result in our company or relevant subsidiaries, as the case may be, being
 the primary beneficiaries of the relevant affiliated entities. As a result of these contractual arrangements, there exists a parent-subsidiary relationship
 between us and the relevant affiliated entities, and we consolidate these affiliated entities through the subsidiaries.

       However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules.
 Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may in the future take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different from the above opinion of our PRC
 counsel. If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our online entertainment business do not comply with
 PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in our businesses, we could be subject to severe penalties including being prohibited from
 continuing operations. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—We rely on contractual
 arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders for our operations in China, which may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct
 ownership.”; “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure— Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to
 how the Foreign Investment Law may impact the viability of our current corporate structure and operations.”; and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk
 Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—If we fail to obtain and maintain the licenses and approvals required within the complex
 regulatory environment applicable to our businesses in China, or if we are required to take compliance actions that are time-consuming or costly, our
 business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.”


 D.     Property, Plant and Equipment
        Our headquarter is located at Wujiaochang commercial district in Shanghai. We lease and occupy office buildings with an aggregate floor area of
 approximately 113,000 square meters. A substantial majority of our employees are based at our headquarters in Shanghai. Our servers and network
 facilities for internal administrative functions are located at our headquarters. We have sales and marketing, and anime production personnel at our
 regional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. We lease and occupy approximately 11,000 square meters of office space in Beijing, approximately 4,500 square
 meters of office space in Wuhan and approximately 1,300 square meters of office space in Tokyo. These leases vary in duration from one to five years.

                                                                             114

        We have established an entity (“Entity”) in Shanghai, China together with Zhuhai Hengqin Wangfu Project Investment LLP (“Wangfu”), an
 independent third party, and two entities controlled by Mr. Rui Chen and Ms. Ni Li, respectively (the “Management Entities”), to acquire the land use
 rights for a parcel of land in Shanghai. We hold 30.01% of the shares of the Entity, Wangfu holds 45.0%, and the Management Entities collectively hold
 the remaining 24.99% of the shares. The total investment for the acquisition of land use rights is approximately RMB9.0 billion. As of the date of this
 annual report, the Entity has obtained the land use rights and we have paid RMB2.8 billion to fund the acquisition of land use rights, including interest-
 bearing guaranteed loans of RMB 1.7 billion in principal. For a detailed description of these loans, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party
 Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Other Related Party Transactions.”

        As of the date of this annual report, some of our leased properties are subject to mortgage, and we have not registered any of our lease agreements
 with the relevant government authorities due to the lack of cooperation from our landlords in registering the relevant lease agreements. The failure to
 register the lease agreements for our leased properties will not affect the validity of these lease agreements, but the competent housing authorities may
 order us to register the lease agreements in a prescribed period of time and impose a fine ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 for each
 non-registered lease agreement if we fail to complete the registration within the prescribed timeframe. As of the date of this annual report, we have not
 received any notification from any competent authority in the PRC in relation to the non-registration of lease agreements.

       Our business depends on our ability to grow our user base, and maintain and increase user engagement. We have experienced rapid user growth
 since our inception. The following table sets forth our average MAU for each of the quarters indicated:

 Note:
 (1)     Our MAUs include mobile apps MAUs and PC MAUs after eliminating duplicates of users who utilize both terminals. We calculate mobile apps MAUs based on the number of
         mobile devices (including smart TV and other smart devices) that launched our mobile apps during a given month.

       Our active users generally view and consume a multitude of content offered on our platform, including videos, live broadcasting, mobile games
 and other content. The number of our users and the level of their engagement on our platform affect our revenues. Revenue from our mobile game
 services has been an important contributor to our total net revenues in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The mobile game user base growth and engagement are
 primarily driven by the launch of new games and the release of updates of our existing games. We witnessed strong growth in the revenues generated
 from VAS due to the increasing number of subscribers of our premium membership program and active viewers of our live broadcasting. We also
 generate advertising revenues from advertisers driven by the size of our user base, the engagement of our users and our brand equity.

                                                                                        115

       We will continue to implement our strategy to grow our user base and increase penetration in Generation Z+ and attract users from wider
 demographics. We will continue to support our PUGV content creators, enrich video content, strengthen our brand recognition and invest in user
 acquisition.


       Our provision and commercialization of diversified product and service offerings
       Our revenues and results of operations depend on our ability to convert more users to paying users and to increase their spending on our platform,
 which is driven by our provision of diversified product and service offerings appealing to our users. Paying users on our platform refer to users who
 make payments for various products and services on our platform, including purchases in mobile games offered on our platform and payments for VAS
 (excluding purchase on our e-commerce platform). A user who makes payments across different products and services offered on our platform using the
 same registered account is counted as one paying user.

       The number of average monthly paying users has generally been increasing primarily attributable to the popularity of our premium membership
 program driven by the high-quality content that we offer, the expansion of our mobile games operations and diversification of other value-added services
 offerings. The occasional decrease of our average monthly revenue per paying user was mainly due to a substantial increase in the number of paying
 users attributable to our premium membership program, who on average make lower payments than other paying users such as those for the mobile
 games. Paying users who subscribe to our premium membership program are likely to consume derivative products of their interested OGV on our
 platform. For example, while enjoying an anime in our content library, such paying users are also likely to pay for the games developed based on that
 anime offered on our platform, the same theme of comic books, audio dramas, and figure toys of the characters in the anime. We therefore see large
 commercial potentials in the derivative content consumptions.

        We are continuing to diversify our product and service offerings and refine our commercialization avenues without compromising user experience.
 We will continue our efforts to enrich our content library, including PUGV, live broadcasting, OGV and mobile games, to convert more users to paying
 users. We plan to launch more high-quality games to satisfy our users’ evolving needs. In addition, we expect to have increased revenues from
 advertising, as advertisers across different industries are turning to Bilibili to tap into the coveted Generation Z+ in China. We will also continue to
 develop our live broadcasting and other VAS. Our revenue growth will be affected by our ability to effectively execute our commercialization strategies
 and expand our paying user base.


       Our brand recognition and market leadership
       Our brand recognition as a leading video community among the Generation Z+ in China is crucial for us to attract and retain users, content
 creators and our business partners, and increase our revenues. We will continue to promote our brand name among broader young generations and
 increase our appeal to mass market.

                                                                            116

       Our ability to manage our costs and expenses
        Our results of operations depend on our ability to manage our costs and expenses. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of revenue-sharing
 costs, content costs, server and bandwidth service costs and e-commerce and other costs. We expect our revenue-sharing costs to increase in absolute
 amount due to our business expansion in mobile games, live broadcasting and advertising businesses. We expect our content costs to increase in absolute
 amount as we continue to produce and procure high-quality content for our users. In addition, we expect the absolute amount of our server and
 bandwidth costs and our e-commerce and other costs to increase as we grow our business. We will also continue the investment in our brand recognition
 and user base for our long-term success, therefore we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute amount as well.


       Investment in technology and talents
        Our technology is critical for us to better understand our users, improve user experience, maintain a vibrant community, and execute our
 commercialization strategy. Our current research and development efforts in technology are primarily focused on enhancing our artificial intelligence
 technology, big data analytics capabilities and cloud technology, which we believe are crucial for us to develop user insights so as to provide more
 relevant and engaging content to our users and to improve our operating efficiency. In addition, there is a strong demand in China’s internet industry for
 talented and experienced personnel. We must recruit, retain and motivate talented employees while controlling our personnel-related expenses, including
 share-based compensation expenses.


 Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations and Financial Performance
       A substantial majority of our revenues and workforce are concentrated in China. To contain the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government has
 taken certain emergency measures, including extension of the Lunar New Year holidays, implementation of travel bans, blockade of certain roads and
 closure of factories and businesses, and encouragement of remote working arrangements and cancellation of public activities. Recently, there has been a
 recurrence of COVID-19 outbreaks in certain provinces of China, including Shanghai, due to the Delta and Omicron variants. As a result, the Chinese
 government has implemented similar emergency measures to contain further spread of COVID-19.

       In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic may, among other things, (i) disrupt our supply chain, delay our ability to timely fulfill our e-commerce orders
 and lead to higher fulfilment expenses, (ii) reduce or curtail our customers’ advertising expenditures and overall demand for our services, and increase
 the volatility of their advertising expenditure patterns from period-to-period, (iii) increase the volatility of the size and engagement of our active user
 base, and cause us to incur higher bandwidth costs, (iv) cause delays in production and uncertainty in scheduling of content of our licensed content
 providers, which may in turn hinder our user acquisition and user engagement level improvement efforts, and (v) require us to take the initiatives in
 response to COVID-19 and many other efforts to leverage our technology, products and services to help contain the pandemic, all of which could have a
 material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

       Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the health and safety of our employees by (i) adopting remote working arrangements
 for our employees in affected regions, (ii) upgrading our telecommuting system, (iii) monitoring our employees’ health, and (iv) optimizing our
 technology system to support potential growth in user traffic. However, the remote working arrangement could reduce the capacity and efficiency of our
 operations and negatively impact the normal business operations.

        We continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from government and public health authorities and may take additional actions based
 on their recommendations. There remains uncertainty around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken, or may be
 taken, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will depend on numerous factors, including, among others, the emergence of new cases of
 COVID-19 and its variants, hospitalization and mortality rates, and the availability and distribution of safe and effective treatments and vaccines.
 Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations at
 this time, which may be material. See also “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We face risks
 related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly disrupt our operations.”

                                                                            117

       As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, as well as short-term investments were RMB30.2 billion (US$4.7 billion).
 Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operating activities, as well as the proceeds we received from our public offerings of
 ordinary shares and other financing activities. We believe this level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.

        Mobile games. We primarily offer exclusively distributed mobile games and jointly operated mobile games developed by third-party game
 developers. For exclusively distributed mobile games, we are responsible for game launch, hosting and maintenance of game servers, game promotions
 and customer services. We also develop localized versions for games licensed from overseas developers. For jointly operated mobile game services, we
 provide our mobile game platform for mobile games developed by third-party developers. We earn game distribution service revenue within the
 applicable contract periods by providing payment solutions and game promotion services, while game developers are responsible for providing game
 products, hosting and maintaining game servers and determining the pricing of in-game virtual items. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 59
 exclusively distributed mobile games and hundreds of jointly operated mobile games. Our revenues from mobile games depend on the number of paying
 users, and ultimately are determined by our ability to select, procure and offer engaging games tailored to our platform and our user preferences. We
 expect revenues from mobile games to fluctuate but remain as an important stream of revenues. At the same time, we expect greater contribution by
 revenues from other streams of business as we take initiatives to grow our VAS, advertising and e-commerce businesses.

       VAS. We primarily generate VAS revenues from (i) subscription fees of our premium membership program, which offers paying members benefits
 including an exclusive or advance access to certain high-quality OGV, and (ii) sales of in-channel virtual items for use in our live broadcasting so that
 users can send them to hosts to show their support, which comprise of either consumable items, such as gifts and items that create special visual effects,
 or time-based items, such as privileges and titles. Meanwhile, we also generate revenues from other VAS including sales of paid content and virtual
 items on our video, audio and comic platforms. We expect revenues from VAS to continue to grow driven by the increasing popularity of our premium
 membership programs and live broadcasting.

       Advertising. We generate advertising revenues primarily from brand advertising and performance-based feed advertisements. Brand
 advertisements primarily appear on the app opening page, the top banner, the website home page banner and the inline video feed alongside organic
 feeds. Brand advertisements can also be customized according to advertisers’ need and appeared in Bilibili-produced OGV or events. Performance-
 based advertisements primarily appear as inline video feeds alongside with organic feeds. Leveraging our deep user insight, we can push the
 advertisements to users who are most likely to be interested. We have also worked with our content creators and licensed content providers to offer
 advertisers customized native advertisements. We expect our advertising revenues to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to introduce new
 advertising and marketing solutions and attract more advertisers.

                                                                             118

      E-commerce and others. Our e-commerce and others primarily consist of sales of products on our e-commerce platform. We expect an increase in
 e-commerce and others in the foreseeable future considering the growing demand for ACG-related products from our users.

 Notes:

 (1)   Numerator is the total net revenues.
 (2)   Numerator includes only revenues from mobile games and VAS.

       Mobile games. Our net revenues from mobile games increased by 6.0% from RMB4,803.4 million in 2020 to RMB5,090.9 million (US$798.9
 million) in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the popularity of our newly operated exclusively distributed and jointly operated mobile games. As
 of December 31, 2021, we operated 59 exclusively distributed mobile games and hundreds of jointly operated mobile games.

       VAS. Our net revenues from VAS increased by 80.3% from RMB3,845.7 million in 2020 to RMB6,934.9 million (US$1,088.2 million) in 2021,
 mainly attributable to our enhanced monetization efforts, led by an increase in the number of paying users for our value-added services including the
 premium membership program, live broadcasting services and other value-added services, attracted by the high quality and diversified content on our
 platform.

       Advertising. Our net revenues from advertising increased by 145.5% from RMB1,842.8 million in 2020 to RMB4,523.4 million (US$709.8
 million) in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to the increasing number of advertisers, which was driven by further recognition of Bilibili’s
 brand name in China’s online advertising market as well as our offering of innovative, industry-tailored advertising solutions. The increase in our user
 base also attracted more advertisers to promote their products and services on our platform, especially for the advertisers who operate in our leading
 content verticals, due to the greater exposure that the advertisements could enjoy on our platform. Our average MAU increased from 185.8 million in
 2020 to 249.8 million in 2021.

       E-commerce and Others. We had RMB1,507.2 million and RMB2,834.5 million (US$444.8 million) of e-commerce and other net revenues in
 2020 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of products on our e-commerce platform. As our user base
 increased and more users became engaged in interest-based sub-communities such as ACG, the demand for ACG related merchandise as well as content
 offering grew, which drove the increase in our revenues from e-commerce and others.

                                                                            121

       Revenue-sharing costs, increased by 77.1% from RMB4,366.5 million in 2020 to RMB7,733.3 million (US$1,213.5 million) in 2021, primarily
 due to an increase in revenue-sharing payment made to hosts and content creators on our platform as the number of hosts and content creators on our

        Content costs increased by 43.7% from RMB1,875.5 million in 2020 to RMB2,694.8 million (US$422.9 million) in 2021, as we continued to
 expand and diversify our content offerings. We procured anime, documentaries, selected TV shows, movies and variety shows to enrich our content
 library. Our investment in content costs has contributed to the growth in our users base and the number of average monthly paying user for VAS.

       Server and bandwidth costs increased by 37.2% from RMB1,141.3 million in 2020 to RMB1,565.9 million (US$245.7 million) in 2021, primarily
 due to an increase in server and bandwidth capacity to keep pace with the expansion of our user base and the increase in active users, so as to support a
 massive and continuously increasing volume of data generated and video views happened on our platform every day.

        E-commerce and other costs increased by 88.5% from RMB1,775.5 million in 2020 to RMB3,346.4 million (US$525.1 million) in 2021, primarily
 attributable to an increase in cost of goods sold associated with our e-commerce business and an increase in staff cost. As our user base increased and
 more users became engaged in interest-based sub-communities such as ACG, the demand for ACG related merchandise also grew, which drove the
 increase in our revenues from e-commerce. We endeavored to enlarge the types of goods and enrich the content available on our e-commerce platform.

 executed our management strategy to invest in the expansion of our user base and the growth of our business, which led to the increases in sales and
 marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, as well as research and development expenses.

       Sales and marketing expenses.
        Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 65.9% from RMB3,492.1 million in 2020 to RMB5,794.9 million (US$909.3 million) in 2021,
 primarily attributable to increased channel and marketing expenses associated with our app and brand, as well as expenses associated with our mobile
 games’ promotion and an increase in headcount in sales and marketing personnel. Our marketing and promotional expenses increased by 69.8% from
 RMB3,006.0 million in 2020 to RMB5,102.9 million (US$800.8 million) in 2021, primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with the
 promotion of our brand and other marketing activities and the promotion of our newly launched mobile games that are exclusively distributed on our
 platform. We launched a series of campaigns aimed at spreading the Bilibili brand name among a broader audience since the second quarter of 2020, and
 continued to launch promotional activities in 2021, to help bring an uptick in brand perception and increase brand awareness across different
 demographics. Our marketing and promotional efforts also include placing advertisements for our newly launched mobile games that are exclusively
 distributed on our platform, such as Guardian Tales.

       General and administrative expenses.
       Our general and administrative expenses increased by 88.3% from RMB976.1 million in 2020 to RMB1,837.5 million (US$288.3 million) in
 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount in general and administrative personnel, and an increase in share-based
 compensation expenses for these personnel, allowance for doubtful accounts, rental expenses and other general and administrative expenses.

                                                                            122

 content related to S10 League of Legends E-sports global events in China, and recorded other net revenues of RMB330.2 million in 2020. As our user
 base increased and more users became engaged in interest-based sub-communities such as ACG, the demand for ACG related merchandise as well as
 content offering grew, which drove the increase in our revenues from e-commerce and others.


       Cost of revenues
       Our cost of revenues increased by 63.9% from RMB5,587.7 million in 2019 to RMB9,158.8 million in 2020 as all components of cost of revenues
 increased due to our business growth and the expansion of our user base.

       Revenue-sharing costs, increased by 75.1% from RMB2,494.4 million in 2019 to RMB4,366.5 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in
 payments made to developers of exclusively distributed games as we rolled out more games, an increase in payments made to distribution channels as
 we expanded our mobile games and VAS offerings, and an increase in payments made to hosts of live broadcasting and content creators on our platform
 due to the increase in the numbers of our hosts and content creators.

       Content costs increased by 87.3% from RMB1,001.6 million in 2019 to RMB1,875.5 million in 2020 as we continued to expand and diversify our
 content offerings. We procured anime, documentaries, selected TV shows, movies and variety shows to enrich our content library. We have a large
 anime libraries. We provided over 3,000 documentaries on our platform in 2020, also showcasing our large documentary repositories. Our investment in
 content costs has contributed to the growth in our users base and the number of average monthly paying user for VAS.

       Server and bandwidth costs increased by 24.1% from RMB919.8 million in 2019 to RMB1,141.3 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in
 server and bandwidth capacity to keep pace with the expansion of our user base and the increase in active users, so as to support a massive and
 continuously increasing volume of data generated and video views happened on our platform every day.

       E-commerce and other costs increased by 51.5% from RMB1,171.9 million in 2019 to RMB1,775.5 million in 2020, primarily attributable to an
 increase in cost of goods sold associated with our e-commerce business and an increase in staff cost. As our user base increased and more users became
 engaged in interest-based sub-communities such as ACG, the demand for ACG related merchandise also grew, which drove the increase in our revenues
 from e-commerce. We endeavored to enlarge the types of goods and enrich the content available on our e-commerce platform.


       Gross profit
       As a result of the foregoing, we had gross profit of RMB2,840.2 million in 2020, compared to gross profit of RMB1,190.2 million in 2019.


       Operating expenses
      Our total operating expenses increased by 122.7% from RMB2,685.4 million in 2019 to RMB5,981.1 million in 2020, as we executed our
 management strategy to invest in the expansion of our user base and the growth of our business, which led to the increases in sales and marketing
 expenses, general and administrative expenses, as well as research and development expenses.

                                                                            124

       Sales and marketing expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 191.4% from RMB1,198.5 million in 2019 to RMB3,492.1 million
 in 2020, primarily attributable to increased channel and marketing expenses associated with our app and brand, as well as expenses associated with our
 mobile games’ promotion and an increase in headcount in sales and marketing personnel. Our marketing and promotional expenses increased by 221.6%
 from RMB934.7 million in 2019 to RMB3,006.0 million in 2020, primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with the promotion of our
 brand and other marketing activities.

      General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses increased by 64.7% from RMB592.5 million in 2019 to
 RMB976.1 million in 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in headcount in general and administrative personnel, share-based
 compensation expenses, allowance for doubtful accounts, rental expenses and other general and administrative expenses.

       Research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses increased by 69.2% from RMB894.4 million in 2019 to
 RMB1,513.0 million in 2020, primarily due to increases in headcount in research and development personnel, share-based compensation expenses and
 other research and development expenses.


       Loss from operations
       We incurred loss from operations of RMB3,141.0 million in 2020, compared to loss from operations of RMB1,495.2 million in 2019, primarily
 due to the significant increase in sales and marketing expenses, as well as research and development expenses as a result of our management strategy to
 invest in the expansion of our user base and the growth of our business.


       Other income
        Investment income, net. Net investment income primarily includes return earned on financial products issued by banks and other financial
 institutions, return from investments in money market funds, gain from disposal of long-term investments, and the fair value change of investments in
 publicly traded companies. We had net investment income of RMB28.2 million in 2020, compared to RMB96.6 million in 2019.

    Interest income. Interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. We had interest income of
 RMB162.8 million and RMB83.3 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

       Interest expense. Interest expense primarily represents interest payment and amortized issuance costs related to long-term debt. We had interest
 expense of RMB108.5 million in 2020, primarily attributable to interest expense related to our 2027 Notes issued in June 2020 and our April 2026 Notes
 issued in April 2019. We had interest expense of RMB46.5 million in 2019, primarily attributable to interest expense related to our 2026 Notes issued in
 April 2019.


       Income tax
       We recorded income tax of RMB53.4 million in 2020, compared to RMB35.9 million in 2019.


       Net loss
       We incurred net loss of RMB3,054.0 million in 2020, compared to net loss of RMB1,303.6 million in 2019, primarily due to the significant
 increase in sales and marketing expenses, as well as research and development expenses as a result of our management strategy to invest in the
 expansion of our user base and the growth of our business.


 Seasonality
       Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the growth of active users tends to accelerate during school holidays,
 such as summer and winter breaks, which typically fall in the middle of the third and first quarters of each year, and slow down at the beginning and
 during certain parts of the school year. We usually experience increase in video views and hence the number of active users following the release of
 phenomenally popular content. Seasonal fluctuations have not thus far posed material operational and financial challenges to us, as such periods tend to
 be brief and predictable, allowing us to re-allocate resources and improve efficiency ahead of time.

                                                                            125

 Taxation
       Cayman Islands
       The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no
 taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty.

       There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be
 applicable on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. In addition, the Cayman Islands does not impose
 withholding tax on dividend payments. No stamp duty is payable in the Cayman Islands on transfers of shares of Cayman Islands companies except
 those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not a party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any
 payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.

       Payments of dividends and capital in respect of the ADSs or ordinary shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no
 withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the ADSs or ordinary shares, nor will gains derived from the
 disposal of the ADSs or ordinary shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.


       Hong Kong
        Majority of our subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong, such as Hode HK and Bilibili HK Limited, are subject to 16.5% Hong Kong profit tax on
 their taxable income generated from operations in Hong Kong. Commencing from the year of assessment of 2018, the first HK$2 million of profits
 earned by one of our subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong could be taxed at half the current tax rate (i.e. 8.25%) while the remaining profits will
 continue to be taxed at the existing 16.5% tax rate. Under the Hong Kong tax laws, we are exempted from the Hong Kong income tax on our foreign-
 derived income. In addition, payments of dividends from our Hong Kong subsidiaries to us are not subject to any Hong Kong withholding tax.


       PRC
       Our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC EIT on their taxable income in accordance with the relevant PRC income tax laws. Effective from
 January 1, 2008, the statutory corporate income tax rate is 25%, except for certain entities eligible for preferential tax rates.

        For example, in 2017, Hode Information Technology qualified as a HNTE and is eligible for a 15% preferential tax rate effective for three years
 starting from 2017 to 2019. Hode Information Technology has renewed this qualification which allows it to enjoy a 15% preferential EIT rate for three
 years starting from 2020 to 2022. In addition, in 2018, Shanghai Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd. qualified as a HNTE and is eligible for a 15% preferential
 tax rate effective for three years starting from 2018 to 2020. Shanghai Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd. has renewed this qualification which allows it to
 enjoy a 15% preferential EIT rate for three years starting from 2021 to 2023.

      Our other major PRC subsidiaries are subject to enterprise income tax on their taxable income in China at a statutory rate of 25%. The enterprise
 income tax is calculated based on the entity’s global income as determined under PRC tax laws and accounting standards.

       We are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 6% for our rendered services and value-added tax at a rate varying from 0% to 16% for goods sold
 depending on their categories in different periods in 2019, 2020 and 2021. We are subject to surcharges on value-added tax payments in accordance with
 PRC law. Our advertising and marketing revenues (valued-added tax included) are subject to culture business construction fee at a rate of 3% in the first
 half year of 2019, which was reduced to 1.5% since July 1, 2019, valid until December 31, 2024, and was exempted in fiscal years of 2020 and 2021 as
 part of the measures taken by the government to ease the negative impact from COVID-19 pandemic.

                                                                           126

       Dividends paid by our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to our intermediary holding company in Hong Kong will be subject to a
 withholding tax rate of 10%, unless the relevant Hong Kong entity satisfies all the requirements under the Arrangement between China and the Hong
 Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and
 Capital and receives approval from the relevant tax authority. If our Hong Kong subsidiary satisfies all the requirements under the tax arrangement and
 receives approval from the relevant tax authority, then the dividends paid to the Hong Kong subsidiary would be subject to withholding tax at the
 standard rate of 5%. Effective from November 1, 2015, the above mentioned approval requirement has been abolished, but a Hong Kong entity is still
 required to file application package with the relevant tax authority, and settle the overdue taxes if the preferential 5% tax rate is denied based on the
 subsequent review of the application package by the relevant tax authority. On October 14, 2019, Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy
 Treatments under Tax Treaties (SAT Announcement (2019) No. 35) was issued to simplify the procedures for claiming China tax treaty benefits by
 non-resident taxpayers. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—We may rely on dividends paid by
 our PRC subsidiaries to fund cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a
 material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and to pay dividends to our shareholders and ADS holders.”

       If Bilibili, a holding company in the Cayman Islands or any of its subsidiaries outside of China were deemed to be a “resident enterprise” under
 the PRC EIT Law, it would be subject to enterprise income tax on its worldwide income at a rate of 25%. See “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk
 Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification
 could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.”


 Inflation
       Inflation in China has not materially impacted our results of operations in recent years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China,
 the year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for December 2020 and 2021 were increases of 0.2% and 1.5%, respectively. Although
 we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we can provide no assurance that we will not be affected by higher rates of inflation in
 China in the future.


 B.    Liquidity and Capital Resources
       The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:

                                                                                                         For the Year Ended December 31,

       As of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were RMB4,962.7 million, RMB4,678.1 million and
 RMB7,523.1 million (US$1,180.5 million). Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand, demand deposits placed with large
 reputable banks in the United States and China, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with original
 terms of three months or less. We entered into several one-year evolving loan facilities with an aggregate principal amount of RMB800.0 million
 (US$125.5 million) provided by certain financial institutions as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, such credit facility had been utilized
 for RMB700 million (US$109.8 million).

                                                                            127
Table of Contents

       Our principal sources of liquidity had been cash generated from operating activities (from 2019 to 2020), as well as the proceeds we received from
 our public offerings of ordinary shares, our offerings of convertible senior notes and other financing activities for the past three years.
       •       In April 2019, we issued US$500 million in an aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026, or the April 2026 Notes.
               Concurrently with the issuance of April 2026 Notes, we completed a registered offering of ADSs, where we offered 14,173,813 ADSs at a
               price of US$18.00 per ADS. We raised from the April 2026 Notes and the concurrent registered offering of ADSs a total of
               US$733.9 million in net proceeds after deducting commissions and offering expenses. In 2021, holders of April 2026 Notes converted in
               aggregate of US$70.6 million principal amount, and we issued 2,854,253 ADSs to the relevant holders accordingly.
       •       In April 2020, we issued 17,310,696 Class Z ordinary shares to Sony Corporation of America for its investment of US$399.4 million in
               cash after deducting transaction expenses. In June 2020, we issued US$800 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior
               notes due 2027, or the 2027 Notes. We raised from the 2027 Notes US$786.1 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses.
               In 2021, holders of 2027 Notes converted in aggregate of US$1,000 principal amount, and we issued 24 ADSs to the relevant holders
               accordingly.
       •       In March and April 2021, in connection with our Hong Kong secondary listing, we issued 28,750,000 Class Z Ordinary Shares (including
               over-allotment of an aggregate of 3,750,000 Class Z ordinary shares in April 2021), consisting of an international offering of 28,000,000
               Class Z ordinary shares and a Hong Kong public offering of 750,000 Class Z ordinary shares. We raised from the Global Offering
               approximately HK$22.9 billion (RMB19.3 billion), after deducting underwriting expenses and other offering expenses.
       •       In November 2021, we issued US$1,600 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026, or the December
               2026 Notes. We raised from December 2026 Notes US$1,576.6 million (RMB10.1 billion) after deducting commissions and offering
               expenses. In March 2022, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase a portion of our existing December 2026 Notes through
               privately negotiated transactions. As of the date of this annual report, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of US$204.0 million
               of December 2026 Notes with a total cash consideration of US$147.9 million.

        The indentures governing the Bilibili Convertible Notes define a “fundamental change” to include, among others: (i) any person or group gaining
 control of Bilibili Inc., (ii) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the ordinary shares or ADSs as a result of which these securities would be
 converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets; (iii) the shareholders of Bilibili Inc. approving any plan or proposal for
 the liquidation or dissolution of Bilibili Inc.; (iv) the ADSs (or other common equity or ADSs in respect of common equity underlying the convertible
 notes) ceasing to be listed on any of The New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or The NASDAQ Global Market (or any of
 their respective successors); or (v) any change in or amendment to the laws, regulations and rules of the PRC resulting in our company being legally
 prohibited from operating substantially all of the business operations conducted by our company unable to continue to derive substantially all of the
 economic benefits from the business operations conducted by these entities.

       If a fundamental change occurs at any time, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Bilibili Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase
 for cash all or part of their notes in principal amounts of US$1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The fundamental change repurchase price will be
 equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus (except in limited circumstances) accrued and unpaid interest to, but
 excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of December 31, 2021, there was no such event of default or fundamental change.

                                                                              128
Table of Contents

       If an event of default, as defined under the indentures governing the Bilibili Convertible Notes, occurs and is continuing, the trustee by notice to
 us may, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes by notice to us and the trustee may, and the trustee at the written
 request of such holders shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its reasonable satisfaction) declare 100% of the principal
 of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable.

       In the event of a fundamental change, we may also be required to issue additional ADSs or, in the case of the December 2026 Notes, Class Z
 ordinary shares in lieu of ADSs if a holder of the December 2026 Notes so elects, upon conversion of the relevant Bilibili Convertible Notes. In
 addition, upon conversion of the December 2026 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely ADSs (or Class Z ordinary shares if such holder elects to
 receive Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion) to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering
 any fractional ADS), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted.

        We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
 working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, we may enhance our liquidity position or increase our
 cash reserve for future investments through additional capital and finance funding. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further
 dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that
 would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

       As of December 31, 2021, 19.4% of our cash and cash equivalents were held in China, and 3.5% were held by the VIEs and denominated in
 Renminbi. Although we consolidate the results of the VIEs and their subsidiaries, we only have access to the assets or earnings of the VIEs and their
 subsidiaries through our contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational
 Structure.” For restrictions and limitations on liquidity and capital resources as a result of our corporate structure, see “Item 5. Operating and Financial
 Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Holding Company Structure.”

       In utilizing the proceeds, we received from our initial public offering and other financing activities, we may make additional capital contributions
 to our PRC subsidiaries, establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, make loans to our PRC
 subsidiaries, or acquire offshore entities with operations in China in offshore transactions. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations.

        We expect that a substantial majority of our future revenues will be denominated in Renminbi. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations,
 payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be
 made in foreign currencies without prior SAFE approval as long as certain routine procedural requirements are fulfilled. Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries
 are allowed to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior SAFE approval by following certain routine procedural requirements. However,
 approval from or registration with competent government authorities is required where the Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and
 remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may at its
 discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future.


       Operating activities
       Net cash used in operating activities in 2021 was RMB2,647.0 million (US$415.4 million), as compared to net loss of RMB6,808.7 million
 (US$1,068.4 million) in the same period. The difference was primarily due to an increase of RMB429.5 million (US$67.4 million) in accounts
 receivable and an increase of RMB1,747.7 million (US$274.3 million) in prepayments and other assets, partially offset by an increase of
 RMB494.6 million (US$77.6 million) in deferred revenue, an increase of RMB319.7 million (US$50.2 million) in accrued liabilities and other payables

 Holding Company Structure
        Bilibili Inc. is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our PRC subsidiaries, the
 VIEs and their subsidiaries in China. As a result, Bilibili Inc.’s ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries. If our
 existing PRC subsidiaries or any newly formed ones incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their
 ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained
 earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our subsidiaries and the VIEs in
 China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach
 50% of their registered capital. In addition, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on
 PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion funds and staff bonus and welfare funds at their discretion, and the VIEs may allocate a portion of its
 after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to a surplus fund at their discretion. The statutory reserve funds and the discretionary funds are not
 distributable as cash dividends. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned company out of China is subject to examination by the banks
 designated by SAFE. Our PRC subsidiaries have not paid dividends and will not be able to pay dividends until they generate accumulated profits and
 meet the requirements for statutory reserve funds.


 C.    Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc.
 Technology, Research and Development
        Our technology platform has been designed for reliability, scalability and flexibility and is administered by our in-house technology department.
 We have access to a network of approximately 37,000 self-owned and more than 9,000 leased servers across China with power supply and power
 generator backup as of December 31, 2021. This structure, along with other features described below, contributes to the reliability, scalability and
 efficiency of our network.

       AI and big data analytics. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is particularly suitable for reviewing and screening content by recognizing and analyzing
 patterns and connections. As the varieties and quantity of content and user interactions continue to increase, AI capabilities are critical for us to control
 our operating costs and enhance user experience. We utilize big data analytics to create an interest profile for each user account based on user’s actions
 such as post, bullet chatting, comment, like and follow, and demographic data such as age, gender and geography. Empowered by our AI capabilities,
 our interest profile allows us to personalize user interface and push content to our users that they are more likely to find interesting and relevant.

                                                                              132
Table of Contents

        We also leverage AI technology in content management and review procedures to monitor the content uploaded to our platform to detect
 inappropriate or illegal content and to promptly remove any infringing content. Our proprietary AI-based screening system automatically flags and
 screens out newly uploaded videos that have privacy issues or contain illegal or inappropriate content by comparing them with copyrighted or
 objectionable videos stored in our own in-house “black list” databases and identifying those with similar codes, i.e., the key words in the video contents.
 Utilizing various technology models and samples gathered internally or based on regulatory requirements, we build, maintain and continuously update
 our databases to meet the changing regulatory requirements. Once the content is processed by this technology screening system, the system then extracts
 fingerprint trails (the technical features that identify and distinguish a video) from the content and sends them to our content screening team for the
 second-level review. All of the other content, primarily consisting of bullet chats posted by users, is also automatically filtered by our screening system,
 which utilizes an AI-based screening system to conduct semantic analysis on bullet chats to analyse, identify and screen out inappropriate bullet chats.
 Utilizing our proprietary technology, upon user’s instruction to block certain key words in the bullet chats, our platform can execute this instruction
 while still streaming the video on a real-time basis without re-loading the entire video. We employ our proprietary technology to conduct semantic
 analysis of each user’s favorites, blocks and comments settings, so as to understand each user’s unique preference and customarily filter the bullet chats,
 so that each user’s bullet chatting viewing experience is customized.

        We have developed a series of big data analytics technology and obtained a number of patents in relation to big data storage and computation,
 interactive query, real-time computation, and other infrastructure, so as to process and analyze a huge amount of data real time with accuracy and
 stability. For example, we invented a system and methodology to monitor real-time data stream in multi-link transmission which can accurately analyze
 big data real-time transmission, spot inconsistency in the system within minutes, and promptly react to and report such issues. This technology is applied
 in data integration, an infrastructure in the big data analytics field, to ensure the completeness of data integration and to facilitate the accuracy of big
 data analytics, as big data storage, calculation, visualization, application and other upper modules are all computed based on the data generated from the
 data integration. We also invented a methodology and middleware to access data by combining centralized database, centralized memory cache, local
 memory cache and local documents cache, so as to improve the stability of the system upon centralized access to data and the efficiency of the system
 upon large amount of data access, while preventing data inconsistency.

       Cloud. Due to the nature of the products and services we offer, we have a high demand for storage and computing capacities to enhance the
 functionalities of our video player, including running algorithms to produce content recommendations. We have developed an advanced cloud system
 that meets the operational needs of our platform while reducing operating costs.

        Content distribution network. Our web server technology focuses on reducing bandwidth use while enhancing user experience through utilizing
 our content distribution network, or CDN, system. Our CDN components are strategically deployed in the cities where our users concentrate, enabling
 users to access a copy of the content closest to them so that content loading time is minimized. Our proprietary CDN system enhances network
 efficiency by managing and optimizing the workload of the servers through real-time optimization and distribution. This technology allows users to
 upload content without compression and enables viewing of content in higher definition.

       Real-time monitoring and support. We have a network operation support team responsible for the stability and security of our network on a
 24-hour, seven-days-a-week basis. The primary responsibilities of the team members consist of monitoring system performance, troubleshooting,
 detecting system error, random sample testing on servers, maintaining equipment, and testing, evaluating and installing hardware and software.


 Intellectual Property
       We seek to protect our technology, including our proprietary technology infrastructure and core software system, through a combination of
 patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. As of December 31, 2021, we have registered approximately 733 patents,
 942 registered copyrights, 340 registered domain names, including www.bilibili.com, and 5,428 registered trademarks, including “       ”. In addition,
 we had submitted approximately 1,300 additional patent applications and 2,225 trademark applications.

                                                                             133
Table of Contents

        We intend to protect our technology and proprietary rights vigorously, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Even if our
 efforts are successful, we may incur significant costs in defending our rights. From time to time, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging
 infringement of their proprietary rights or declaring their non-infringement of our intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk
 Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could
 result in material damage to our reputation and brand, payment of substantial damages, penalties and fines, removal of relevant content from our
 platform or seeking license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms” and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk
 Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may not be able to prevent others from engaging in unauthorized use of our intellectual
 property, unfair competition, defamation or other violations of our rights, which could harm our business and competitive position.”


 D.    Trend Information
       Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events since
 January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net sales or revenues, income from continuing
 operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future
 operating results or financial condition.


 E.    Critical Accounting Estimates
       We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. We
 continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experiences and various other
 assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting
 process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. Our critical accounting estimates require a higher
 degree of judgment than others in their application and involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them
 have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For a detailed discussion of our significant
 accounting policies and related judgments, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies” of our audited
 consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.


       Revenue recognition for in-game virtual items
      We recognize revenue from the sale of in-game virtual items in exclusively distributed mobile games over the estimated average playing period of
 paying players, starting from the point-in-time when related in-game virtual items are delivered to the paying players’ accounts.

       Nature of Estimates Required – average playing period of paying players. The average playing period of paying player is subjected to period
 assessment. Considering the events or circumstances may change that indicate the change of the estimate, we assessed the average playing period of
 paying player on a quarterly basis. We make a qualitative and quantitative assessment to determine the average playing period of paying players for each
 game. If a qualitative and quantitative assessment identifies the change of the average playing period of paying players based on newly available paying
 players information, we may prospectively apply the change of estimate.

        Assumptions Used. Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect average playing period of paying players and, therefore, can affect
 the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making the average playing period of paying player for each game:
       •      Paying players’ churn rates. A churn rate is calculated starting from the point-in-time when related in-game virtual items are delivered to
              the paying players’ accounts and track populations of paying players who made their initial purchases during the interval period (the
              “Cohort”). Then, we track the number of paying players from each Cohort who left subsequent to their initial purchase. We make
              assumptions about the ending point of a paying player’s lifespan beyond the date for which observable data available and extrapolate the
              actual observed churn rate to arrive at an estimated weighted average playing lifespan for paying players of the selected games.

                                                                             134
Table of Contents

       •      Similarities between newly-launched games and existing games. We make assumption regarding similarities between newly-launched
              games and existing games included in and affected our assumptions regarding playing patterns for paying players for other games with
              similar characteristics with the new games. These assumptions include, but not limited to, paying player type and purchasing frequency.

       In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimate, the assumptions are evaluated accordingly considering historical players’ churn rates,
 playing patterns for paying players and management judgment. Updates to these assumptions will impact the estimate average playing period of paying
 players and the revenue recognized accordingly. If the estimate average playing period of paying players is extended, the revenue will be recognized
 over a longer period and vice versa. See Note 2—2. Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements
 included in this annual report on Form 20-F, for additional information regarding the revenue recognition of mobile game services.


       Impairment on the investment accounted for using the measurement alternative
       For those equity investments without significant influence and readily determinable fair value, we record these investments at cost, less
 impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes.

       Nature of Estimates Required – Investment accounted for using the measurement alternative. We assess the impairment on the investment
 accounted for using the measurement alternative on a quarterly basis, and the assumptions and judgement used in establishing the impairment are
 evaluated regularly. When an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the investment accounted for using the measurement alternative may be
 impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the
 investment accounted for using the measurement alternative is above its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
 Because the impairment indicator may vary substantially over time, estimating the impairment requires a number of assumptions about matter that are
 uncertain.

       Assumptions and Approach Used – Impairment assessment. The approach we used to assess investment impairment are based on assumptions and
 management judgement in considering various factors and events. Many of the factors used in assessing performance and financial position of the
 investee are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and judgement may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or
 management judgement can materially affect to find the impairment indicator, therefore, can affect the test results.

       Assumptions and Approach Used – Fair value of the investees. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we estimate the
 investment’s fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC 820. We measure the fair value of the investees based on market approach or income
 approach.

       The market approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or similar investment of
 investees being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes.

       The income approach is another method for measuring the fair value of the investment and uses cash flow projections. Inherent in the investees’
 development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of the investees’ operating results, business plan forecasts,
 expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about
 future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these
 assumptions and estimates may change in future periods.

       Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of the investment and, therefore, can affect the test results.
 The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections:
       •      Business projections. We make assumptions about the investees’ business in the marketplace. These assumptions drive our planning
              assumptions for each revenue streams. We also make assumptions about cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These
              projections are derived using investees’ business plan forecasts.

                                                                             135
Table of Contents

       •        Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-
                free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which the investees’ business unit’s earnings stream is projected to grow
                beyond the planning period.
       •        Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average
                cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall
                risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.
       •        Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry
                sales and pricing estimates for the investees’ business. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, regulatory,
                economic, or technological development, inflation, interest rates, customer preference, and foreign currency exchange rates.

       In the year 2021, we assessed the above indicators, then determined that there were impairment indicators and RMB 91.5 million investment
 impairment were charged. See Note 9. Long-term Investment, Net in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this
 annual report on Form 20-F, for additional information regarding the impairment investment accounted for using the measurement alternative.

 Share Incentive Plans
       In November 2014, our board of directors approved a global share incentive plan, or the Global Share Plan, to attract and retain the best available
 personnel, provide additional incentives to employees, directors and consultants and promote the success of our business. In February 2018, our
 shareholders and board of directors adopted the 2018 share incentive plan, or the 2018 Plan, to attract and retain the best available personnel, provide
 additional incentives to employees, directors and consultants and promote the success of our business. We subsequently amended our 2018 Plan in
 March 2020 by unanimous written approval of our board of directors.

        As of February 28, 2022, the maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards under the Global Share
 Plan is 19,880,315 ordinary shares, subject to amendment. The maximum aggregate number of shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards under
 the 2018 Plan, or the Award Pool, is initially 6,962,069, provided that, in the event that the aggregate number of shares which may be issued pursuant to
 all granted awards (including incentive share options) reaches 6,962,069, thereafter the Award Pool of the 2018 Plan shall be increased automatically if
 and whenever the unissued shares reserved accounts for less than 0.5% of the total number of shares of Bilibili issued and outstanding on the last day of
 the immediately preceding fiscal year (excluding issued shares reserved for future option exercise and restricted share unit vesting), as a result of which
 increase the shares unissued and reserved in the Award Pool immediately after each such increase shall equal to 2.5% of the total number of shares of
 Bilibili issued and outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year (excluding issued shares reserved for future option exercise and
 restricted share unit vesting).

      The aggregate number of Class Z Ordinary Shares available for future grant under the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan was 2,752,294 as of
 February 28, 2022.

       The following paragraphs describe the principal terms of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan.

       Types of Awards. The Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan both permit the awards of options, restricted shares, restricted share units or any other
 type of awards approved by the plan administrator.

        Plan Administration. Our chairman of the board of directors or a committee of one or more members of the board of directors will administer the
 Global Share Plan. The chairman or the committee, as applicable, will determine the participants to receive awards, the type and number of awards to be
 granted to each participant, and the terms and conditions of each award under the Global Share Plan. The full board of directors will conduct the general
 administration of the Global Share Plan if required by applicable laws and with respect to awards granted to the chairman of the board of directors, the
 committee members (if applicable), independent directors and executive officers of Bilibili. Our board of directors or a committee of one or more
 members of the board of directors will administer the 2018 Plan. The committee or the full board of directors, as applicable, will determine the
 participants to receive awards, the type and number of awards to be granted to each participant, and the terms and conditions of each award under the
 2018 Plan.

       Award Agreement. Awards granted under the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth terms,
 conditions and limitations for each award, which may include the term of the award, the provisions applicable in the event that the grantee’s
 employment or service terminates, and our authority to unilaterally or bilaterally amend, modify, suspend, cancel or rescind the award.

       Eligibility. We may grant awards to our employees, directors and consultants of Bilibili under each of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan. In
 addition, under the 2018 Plan, we may grant options that are intended to qualify as incentive share options only to our employees and employees of our
 parent companies and subsidiaries.

      Vesting Schedule. Under each of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan, in general, the plan administrator determines the vesting schedule,
 which is specified in the relevant award agreement.

        Exercise of Options. Under each of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan, the plan administrator determines the exercise price for each award,
 which is stated in the award agreement. The vested portion of option will expire if not exercised prior to the time as the plan administrator determines at
 the time of its grant. However, the maximum exercisable term is ten years from the date of a grant.

        Transfer Restrictions. Under each of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan, awards may not be transferred in any manner by the participant
 other than in accordance with the exceptions provided in the Global Share Plan or the relevant award agreement or otherwise determined by the plan
 administrator, such as transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

                                                                             139

       Termination and Amendment. Unless terminated earlier, each of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan, has a term of ten years. The plan
 administrator has the authority to terminate, amend or modify the Global Share Plan. Our board of directors has the authority to amend or terminate the
 2018 Plan. Except with respect to amendments made by the plan administrator, no termination, amendment or modification may adversely affect in any
 material way any awards previously granted pursuant to each of the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan unless agreed by the participant.

       The following table summarizes, as of February 28, 2022, the number of ordinary shares underlying outstanding options granted to several of our

 Equity Incentive Trusts
       Bilibili Inc. Global Share Incentive Trust and Bilibili Inc. Special Share Incentive Trust, which we collectively refer to as the Equity Incentive
 Trusts, were established under their respective trust deeds, each dated November 28, 2017, between us and Ark Trust (Hong Kong) Limited, or Ark
 Trust, as trustee of each of the Equity Incentive Trusts. Through the Equity Incentive Trusts, our ordinary shares and other rights and interests under
 awards granted pursuant to our Global Share Plan may be provided to certain of recipients of equity awards. The participants in the Equity Incentive
 Trusts include our employees and certain of our executive officers.

       Participants in the Equity Incentive Trusts transfer their equity awards to Ark Trust to be held for their benefit. Upon satisfaction of vesting
 conditions and request by grant recipients, Ark Trust will exercise the equity awards and transfer the relevant ordinary shares and other rights and
 interest under the equity awards to the relevant grant recipients with the consent of the trust administrator. Each of the trust deeds provides that Ark
 Trust shall not exercise the voting rights attached to such ordinary shares unless otherwise directed by the trust administrator, which is an authorized
 representative of our company.


 C.      Board Practices
 Board of Directors
       Our board of directors consists of seven directors. A director is not required to hold any shares in Bilibili by way of qualification. Subject to the
 Nasdaq Stock Market rules, a director may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which he is materially interested
 provided (a) such director, if his interest in such contract or arrangement is material, has declared the nature of his interest at the earliest meeting of the
 board at which it is practicable for him to do so, either specifically or by way of a general notice and (b) if such contract or arrangement is a transaction
 with a related party, such transaction has been approved by the audit committee. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow
 money, mortgage its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for
 any obligation of the company or of any third party. None of our non-executive directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon
 termination of service.

                                                                               140

 our company. The audit committee is responsible for, among other things:

 compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting during which his
 compensation is deliberated. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things:

 time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest to but not less than one-third, shall retire from office by
 rotation provided that every director (including those appointed for a specific term) shall be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three
 years. A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election. The Company, i.e., Bilibili Inc., at the general meeting at which a Director retires may fill the
 vacated office. The directors to retire by rotation shall include (so far as necessary to obtain the number required) any director who wishes to retire and
 not to offer himself for re-election. Any director who has not been subject to retirement by rotation in the three years preceding the annual general
 meeting shall retire by rotation at such annual general meeting. Any further directors so to retire shall be those who have been longest in office since
 their last re-election or appointment and so that as between persons who became or were last re-elected directors on the same day those to retire shall
 (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot. A director is not required to retire upon reaching any particular age. A director
 will be removed from office automatically if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his
 creditors; or (ii) is found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind.

                                                                               142

       As required under PRC regulations, we participate in housing funds and various employee social security plans that are organized by applicable
 local municipal and provincial governments, including housing funds, pension, maternity, medical, work-related injury and unemployment benefit plans,
 under which we make contributions at specified percentages of the salaries of our employees. We also purchase commercial health and accidental
 insurance for our employees. Bonuses are generally discretionary and based in part on employee performance and in part on the overall performance of
 our business. We have granted and plan to continue to grant share-based incentive awards to our employees in the future to incentivize their
 contributions to our growth and development.

        We enter into standard confidentiality and employment agreements with our key employees. The contracts with our key personnel typically
 include a standard non-compete agreement that prohibits the employee from competing with us, directly or indirectly, during his or her employment and
 for at least one year after the termination of his or her employment.

 E.       Share Ownership
      Except as otherwise noted, the following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of
 February 28, 2022 by:
          •        each of our directors and executive officers; and
          •        each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our ordinary shares.

       The calculations in the table below are based on 83,715,114 Class Y ordinary shares and 306,889,473 Class Z ordinary shares outstanding as of
 February 28, 2022 (excluding 2,767,265 Class Z ordinary shares issued and reserved for future issuance upon the exercising or vesting of awards
 granted under our share incentive plans).

       Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially
 owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days after
 February 28, 2022, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or other right or the conversion of any other security. These shares, however,
 are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person.

 Trust Company Americas, the depositary of our ADS program, which held 5.5% Class Z ordinary shares on record as of February 28, 2022. The number
 of beneficial owners of the ADSs in the United States is likely to be much larger than the number of record holders of our ordinary shares in the United
 States.

 Shareholders Agreement and Investor Rights Agreement
        We entered into our shareholders agreement on April 1, 2017 with our shareholders, which consist of holders of ordinary shares and Preferred
 Shares. Pursuant to this shareholders agreement, we have granted certain registration rights to our shareholders. Set forth below is a description of the
 registration rights granted under the agreement.

        Demand Registration Rights. Holders holding at least 10% or more of the issued and outstanding registrable securities (on an as converted basis)
 held by the preferred shareholders, the pre-IPO Class D ordinary shareholders, pre-IPO Class C ordinary shareholders or pre-IPO Class B ordinary
 shareholders have the right to demand in writing that we file a registration statement covering the registration of at least 25% of their registrable
 securities. We have the right to defer filing of a registration statement for a period of not more than 90 days if our board of directors determines in good
 faith that filing of a registration statement in the near future will be materially detrimental to us or our shareholders, but we cannot exercise the deferral
 right more than once for more than once during any twelve-month period and cannot register any other securities during such period. We are not
 obligated to effect more than three demand registrations. Further, if the registrable securities are offered by means of an underwritten offering, and the
 managing underwriter advises us that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten, the underwriters may decide
 to exclude (i) all of the registrable securities in our initial public offering, or (ii) up to 75% of the registrable securities and the number of the registrable
 securities will be allocated among the holders on a pro rata basis according to the number of registrable securities then outstanding held by each holder
 requesting registration, provided that all other equity securities are first excluded.

        Registration on Form F-3 or Form S-3. Any holder may request us to file a registration statement on Form F-3 or Form S-3 if we qualify for
 registration on Form F-3 or Form S-3. The holders are entitled to an unlimited number of registrations on Form F-3 or Form S-3 so long as such
 registration offerings are in excess of US$500,000. We, however, are not obligated to consummate a registration if we have consummated two
 registrations within any twelve month period. We have the right to defer filing of a registration statement for a period of not more than 90 days if our
 board of directors determines in good faith that filing of a registration statement in the near future will be materially detrimental to us or our
 shareholders, but we cannot exercise the deferral right more than once for more than once during any twelve-month period and cannot register any other
 securities during such period.

         Piggyback Registration Rights. If we propose to register for a public offering or our securities other than relating to any share incentive plan or a
 corporate reorganization, we must offer holders of our registrable securities an opportunity to be included in such registration. If the underwriters advise
 in writing that market factors require a limitation of the number of registrable securities to be underwritten, the underwriters may decide to exclude
 (i) all of the registrable securities in our initial public offering, or (ii) up to 75% of the registrable securities and the number of the registrable securities
 will be allocated among the holders on a pro rata basis according to the number of registrable securities then outstanding held by each holder requesting
 registration, provided that all other equity securities are first excluded (except for securities sold for the account of our company).

       Expenses of Registration. We will bear all registration expenses, other than the underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the
 sale of registrable securities, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualification pursuant to the shareholders agreement.

        Termination of Obligations. We have no obligation to effect any demand, piggyback or Form F-3 or Form S-3 registration upon the later of (i) the
 fifth anniversary from the date of closing of a QIPO as defined in the shareholders agreement, and (ii) with respect to any holder, the date following a
 QIPO on which such holder holds less than 1% of the equity securities of our company and all registrable securities may be sold under Rule 144 of the
 Securities Act in any 90-day period.

        Pursuant to the share purchase and investor rights agreement by and between us and Tencent Mobility Limited dated October 3, 2018, we have
 granted certain registration rights to Tencent Mobility Limited or its affiliates. Accordingly, Tencent Mobility Limited or its affiliates are entitled one
 registration on Form F-3, after the expiration of a lock-up period, covering such Class Z ordinary shares issued and sold to Tencent Mobility Limited
 pursuant to the aforesaid share purchase and investor rights agreement.

                                                                                146

 Employment Agreements and Indemnification Agreements
        We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Under these agreements, each of our executive officers is
 employed for a specified time period. We may terminate employment for cause, at any time, without advance notice or remuneration, for certain acts of
 the executive officer, such as conviction or plea of guilty to a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, negligent or dishonest acts to our detriment,
 or misconduct or a failure to perform agreed duties. We may also terminate an executive officer’s employment without cause upon three-month advance
 written notice. In such case of termination by us, we will provide severance payments to the executive officer as expressly required by applicable law of
 the jurisdiction where the executive officer is based. The executive officer may resign at any time with a three-month advance written notice.

        Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the termination or expiry of his or her employment agreement, in strict confidence
 and not to use, except as required in the performance of his or her duties in connection with the employment or pursuant to applicable law, any of our
 confidential information or trade secrets, any confidential information or trade secrets of our clients or prospective clients, or the confidential or
 proprietary information of any third party received by us and for which we have confidential obligations. The executive officers have also agreed to
 disclose in confidence to us all inventions, designs and trade secrets which they conceive, develop or reduce to practice during the executive officer’s
 employment with us and to assign all right, title and interest in them to us, and assist us in obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and other legal
 rights for these inventions, designs and trade secrets.

        In addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of his or her
 employment and typically for one year following the last date of employment. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to (i) approach our
 suppliers, clients, customers or contacts or other persons or entities introduced to the executive officer in his or her capacity as a representative of us for
 the purpose of doing business with such persons or entities that will harm our business relationships with these persons or entities; (ii) assume
 employment with or provide services to any of our competitors, or engage, whether as principal, partner, licensor or otherwise, any of our competitors,
 without our express consent; or (iii) seek directly or indirectly, to solicit the services of any of our employees who is employed by us on or after the date
 of the executive officer’s termination, or in the year preceding such termination, without our express consent.

       We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, we agree to
 indemnify our directors and executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by
 reason of their being a director or officer of Bilibili.


 Share Incentive Plan
       See “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—B. Compensation—Share Incentive Plans.”


 Other Related Party Transactions
        Investment transfers. In June 2019, we transferred several equity investments to an investment fund, and one of our subsidiaries was its limited
 partner. The cost of the equity investments transfer was RMB465.8 million. The consideration was RMB539.6 million, which was determined based on
 the estimated fair value of the investments. The difference between the consideration and cost of the investments was recognized as investment income.
 In July 2020, we acquired certain equity interests of two investments from the investment fund with the consideration of RMB110.0 million, which was
 based on the estimated fair value of the investments. The balances due from the investment fund as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020, and
 December 31, 2021 were consideration receivables and dividend receivables, which was non-trade in nature.

     Promotional and other services. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we purchased goods, promotional and other services
 amounting to RMB87.6 million, RMB35.1 million and RMB117.1 million (US$18.4 million), respectively.

                                                                              147
Table of Contents

       As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had RMB195.3 million due from the investment fund and other related parties, and RMB74.2 million due
 from the investment fund which was non-trade in nature, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had RMB48.1 million due from the investment
 fund, which was non-trade in nature.

       In July 2019, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire a controlling interest in Chaodian. In September 2020, we acquired noncontrolling
 interest of Chaodian from certain related parties on which we have significant influence, with purchase consideration of RMB257.3 million. As of
 December 31, 2021, we had no unpaid consideration due to certain related parties.

       Interest bearing loans. The balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 mainly represent interest-bearing loans and interest expenses of
 RMB105.6 million and RMB279.2 million related to an equity investee, which was non-trade in nature, and partially offset by the trade payables to the
 equity investee. Interest rates of loans to the investee incurred in 2020 and 2021 were 2.8% and 4.5%, respectively.

       Interest bearing guaranteed loans. We established an entity with an independent third party and two entities respectively controlled by Mr. Rui
 Chen and Ms. Ni Li to acquire the land use rights for a parcel of land in Shanghai for future construction. We made capital contribution of
 RMB1,084.3 million and provided interest-bearing guaranteed loans of an aggregate principal amount of RMB1,701.0 million to an entity for its
 operation. The annual interest rates of the loans were 3.3%. The balance as of December 31, 2021 represents interest-bearing guaranteed loans and
 interest expenses related to an entity, which are non-trade in nature.

 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 A.    Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information
       We have appended consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report.


 Legal Proceedings
       We may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are
 currently involved in approximately 210 lawsuits based on allegations of infringement of third-party copyright due to the content posted on our
 platform, which are immaterial to our company on an individual basis or a collective basis. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding,
 regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.

       Under the current PRC regulatory scheme, a number of regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the NRTA, the NAPP, the MCT, the MIIT,
 and the CAC, jointly regulate all major aspects of the internet industry, including the mobile internet and mobile games businesses. Operators must
 obtain various government approvals and licenses for relevant mobile business.

       We have obtained Value-added Telecommunication Business Licenses for the provision of value-added telecommunication business, License for
 Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs for the provision of internet audio-visual program services, Online Culture Operating Permits for
 operation of commercial internet culture activities, and License for Production and Operation of Radio and Television Programs for the radio, television
 and anime production and operation business. These licenses are essential to the operation of our business and are generally subject to regular
 government review or renewal.

       Under regulations issued by the SAPPRFT, the publication of each online game requires approval from the SAPPRFT, and after the institutional
 restructuring of the SAPPRFT, we currently apply with the NAPP for the approvals for publishing our games. As of the date of this annual report, we
 have obtained approvals from the NAPP for all of the domestic and imported online games exclusively operated by us which are in operation in the
 PRC. For the online games we jointly operate with third parties, we also require them to obtain requisite approvals from the NAPP. In 2019, 2020 and
 2021, substantially all of the revenues from our jointly operated mobile games in China were contributed by approximately 60 of our online jointly
 operated mobile games in the PRC, and all of them have obtained approvals from the NAPP.


                                                                           148

       The material regulations directly relevant to our business include but not limited to the Administrative Regulations on Internet Audio-Visual
 Program Service, the Administrative Provisions on Online Audio-Visual Information Services, the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of the
 Content of Internet Audio-Visual Programs, the Administrative Regulations on Online Live Broadcasting Services, the Notice on Strengthening the
 Management of Online Show Live Broadcasting and E-commerce Live Broadcasting, the Notice on Strengthen the Management of Live Broadcasting
 Service, Notice on Further Strict Management to Effectively Prevent Minors from Being Addicted to Online Games and the Law of the PRC on the
 Protection of Minors (2020 Revision). See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation” for more information.

        We are not currently a party to, nor are we aware of, any other legal proceeding, investigation or claim which, in the opinion of our management,
 is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.


 Dividend Policy
       Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain requirements of Cayman Islands law. Even if
 our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital
 requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.

       We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future after our initial public offering. We
 currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.

        Bilibili is a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It may rely on dividends from its subsidiaries in China for its cash
 requirements, including any payment of dividends to its shareholders. PRC regulations may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends
 to us. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Dividend Distributions.”

       If we pay any dividends on our ordinary shares, we will pay those dividends which are payable in respect of the Class Z ordinary shares
 underlying the ADSs to the depositary, as the registered holder of such Class Z ordinary shares, and the depositary then will pay such amounts to the
 ADS holders in proportion to Class Z ordinary shares underlying the ADSs held by such ADS holders, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement,
 including the fees and expenses payable thereunder. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars.


 B.    Significant Changes
       We have not experienced any significant changes since the date of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.


 ITEM 9. THE OFFER AND LISTING
 A.    Offering and Listing Details
        See “C. Markets” for our host market and trading symbol. We have a dual-class common share structure in which Class Y ordinary shares have
 different voting rights from Class Z ordinary shares. Class Y ordinary shares are each entitled to ten votes, whereas Class Z ordinary shares are each
 entitled to one vote. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Listed Securities—Our dual-class share structure with
 different voting rights will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions
 that holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial.”

       Our Class Z ordinary shares have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since March 29, 2021 under the stock code “9626.”

                                                                            149

 B.    Memorandum and Articles of Association
       The following are summaries of material provisions of our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that we have
 adopted and of the Companies Act, insofar as they relate to the material terms of our ordinary shares.

      Objects of Bilibili. Under our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the objects of Bilibili are unrestricted and
 we have the full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the Companies Act (as amended) or any other law of the Cayman Islands.

        Ordinary Shares. Our ordinary shares are divided into Class Y ordinary shares and Class Z ordinary shares. Holders of our Class Y ordinary shares
 and Class Z ordinary shares will have the same rights except for voting and conversion rights. Each Class Z Ordinary Share shall entitle the holder
 thereof to one (1) vote on all matters subject to vote at our general meetings, and each Class Y ordinary share shall entitle the holder thereof to ten
 (10) votes on all matters subject to vote at our general meetings. Class Y ordinary shares shall only be held by a director or a limited partnership, trust,
 private company or other vehicle wholly owned or wholly controlled by a director. Our ordinary shares are issued in registered form and are issued
 when registered in our register of members. Bilibili shall not take any action (including the issue or repurchase of shares of any class) that would result
 in (a) the aggregate number of votes entitled to be cast by all holders of Class Z ordinary shares (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding those who are
 also holders of Class Y ordinary shares) present at a general meeting to be less than 10% of the votes entitled to be cast by all members at a general
 meeting; or (b) an increase in the proportion of Class Y ordinary shares to the total number of shares in issue. No further Class Y ordinary shares shall be
 issued by Bilibili, except with the prior approval of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under limited circumstances as specified in the seventh amended
 and restated memorandum and articles of association. In the event Bilibili reduces the number of shares in issue (e.g. through a purchase of its own
 shares), the holders of Class Y ordinary shares shall reduce their voting rights in Bilibili proportionately, whether through a conversion of a portion of
 their Class Y ordinary shares or otherwise, if the reduction in the number of shares in issue would otherwise result in an increase in the proportion of
 Class Y ordinary shares to the total number of shares in issue.

                                                                             150
Table of Contents

        Conversion. Each Class Y ordinary share is convertible into one Class Z ordinary share at any time at the option of the holder thereof. Class Z
 ordinary shares are not convertible into Class Y ordinary shares under any circumstances. Subject to the Listing Rules or other applicable laws or
 regulations, each Class Y ordinary share shall be automatically converted into one Class Z ordinary share upon the occurrence of the following events:
 (i) the death of the holder of such Class Y ordinary share (or, where the holder is a holding vehicle, the death of the director holding or controlling such
 vehicle); (ii) the holder of such Class Y ordinary share ceasing to be a director or a holding vehicle for a director for any reason; (iii) the holder of such
 Class Y ordinary share (or the director holding or controlling the holding vehicle) being deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to be incapacitated
 for the purpose of performing his duties as a director; (iv) the holder of such Class Y ordinary Share (or the director holding or controlling the holding
 vehicle) being deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to no longer meet the requirements of a director set out in the Listing Rules; and (v) the
 transfer to another person of the beneficial ownership of, or economic interest in, such Class Y ordinary share or the control over the voting rights
 attached to such Class Y ordinary share (through voting proxies or otherwise), other than certain exceptions as specified in the seventh amended and
 restated memorandum and articles of association.

        Dividends. The holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. Our seventh amended
 and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that dividends may be declared and paid out of funds legally available for distribution
 including our profits, which our board of directors thinks fit. Dividends may also be declared and paid out of share premium account or any other fund
 or account of Bilibili which can be authorized for this purpose in accordance with the Companies Act. Under the laws of the Cayman Islands, Bilibili
 may pay a dividend out of either profit or share premium account, provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in
 Bilibili being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.

        Voting Rights. Holders of our ordinary shares have the right to receive notice of, attend, speak and vote at general meetings of Bilibili. On a show
 of hands every shareholder present in person or proxy shall each have one vote and on a poll, each holder of Class Z ordinary shares is entitled to one
 (1) vote per share and each holder of our Class Y ordinary shares is entitled to ten (10) votes per share on all matters submitted to them for a vote at our
 general meetings. Bilibili shall not change the terms of the Class Y ordinary shares to increase the number of votes to which each Class Y ordinary share
 is entitled. Holders of our Class Y ordinary shares and Class Z ordinary shares shall at all times vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to
 a vote by our shareholders, except as may otherwise be required by law. At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be
 decided on a show of hands, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded by the chairman of such meeting
 or any shareholder present in person or by proxy.

       A quorum required for a meeting of shareholders consists of one or more shareholders holding in aggregate not less than 10% of all votes
 attaching to all shares of Bilibili in issue and entitled to vote at such general meeting, present in person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other
 non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative. Advance notice of at least twenty-one (21) calendar days is required for the convening of our
 annual general meeting and at least fourteen (14) calendar days any other shareholders meetings.

        An ordinary resolution to be passed at a meeting by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes attaching to the
 ordinary shares cast by those shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy (or, in the case of corporations, by their duly authorized
 representatives) at a general meeting and of which not less than 14 days’ notice has been duly given. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of
 no less than three-fourths of the votes cast by such shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy (or, in the case of corporations, by
 their authorized representatives) at a general meeting. Both ordinary resolutions and special resolutions may also be passed by a unanimous written
 resolution signed by all the shareholders of Bilibili, as permitted by the Companies Act and our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles
 of association. A special resolution will be required for important matters such as a change of name or making changes that will affect the rights of our
 shareholders.

        General Meetings of Shareholders. At all times during the period commencing from the date on which any of the securities of Bilibili first become
 listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange other than the year of the adoption of the seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of
 association, Bilibili shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meeting in that year and shall specify
 the meeting as such in the notice calling it; and not more than 15 months (or such longer period as may be authorized by the Hong Kong Stock
 Exchange) shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting of Bilibili and that of the next. The annual general meeting shall be held in Hong
 Kong or such other territory where any of the securities of Bilibili is listed on a stock exchange in that territory, or elsewhere as may be determined by
 the board of directors and at such time and place as the board of directors shall appoint.

                                                                              151
Table of Contents

        An annual general meeting of Bilibili shall be called by at least 21 days’ notice in writing, and a general meeting of Bilibili, other than an annual
 general meeting, shall be called by at least 14 days’ notice in writing. The notice shall be exclusive of the day on which it is served or deemed to be
 served and of the day for which it is given. A quorum required for any general meeting of shareholders consists of at least one shareholder present in
 person or by proxy (or, if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its authorized representative), representing not less than 10% of all votes
 attaching to all of our shares in issue and entitled to vote at such general meeting. Where a general meeting is postponed by our directors, such meeting
 shall be postponed to a specific date, time and place.

        The Companies Act provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any
 right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our seventh amended
 and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that upon the requisition of shareholders representing in aggregate not less than 10% of the
 votes attaching to all the issued and outstanding shares of Bilibili that as at the date of the deposit carry the right to vote at general meetings, our board
 will convene an extraordinary general meeting and put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting. However, our seventh amended and
 restated memorandum and articles of association do not provide our shareholders with any right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or
 extraordinary general meetings not called by such shareholders.

       Transfer of Ordinary Shares. Subject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares
 by an instrument of transfer in writing, and shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor, and in respect a nil or partly paid up share, or if our
 directors so requires, signed on behalf of the transferee.

      Our board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share which is not fully paid up or on which
 we have a lien. Our board of directors may also decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share unless:
       •      the instrument of transfer is lodged with us, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other
              evidence as our board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
       •      the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of ordinary shares;
       •      the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required;
       •      in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the ordinary share is to be transferred does not exceed four;
              and
       •      a fee of such maximum sum as the Nasdaq Stock Market may determine to be payable or such lesser sum as our directors may from time to
              time require is paid to us in respect thereof.

      If our directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within three (3) calendar months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was
 lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.

       The registration of transfers may, after compliance with any notice required of the Nasdaq Stock Market, be suspended and the register closed at
 such times and for such periods as our board of directors may from time to time determine, provided that the registration of transfers shall not be
 suspended nor the register closed for more than thirty (30) days in any calendar year.

                                                                              152

       Liquidation. On the winding up of Bilibili, if the assets available for distribution amongst our shareholders shall be more than sufficient to repay
 the whole of the share capital at the commencement of the winding up, the surplus shall be distributed amongst our shareholders in proportion to the par
 value of the shares held by them at the commencement of the winding up, subject to a deduction from those shares in respect of which there are monies
 due, of all monies payable to Bilibili for unpaid calls or otherwise. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay the whole of the share
 capital, such assets will be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by our shareholders in proportion to the par value of the
 shares held by them.

        Calls on Shares and Forfeiture of Shares. Our board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on
 their shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the specified time of payment. The shares that have been
 called upon and remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture.

       Redemption, Repurchase and Surrender of Shares. We may issue shares on terms that such shares are subject to redemption, at our option or at the
 option of the holders of these shares, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our board of directors, or by the shareholders by
 special resolutions. Bilibili may also repurchase any of our shares on such terms and in such manner as have been approved by our board of directors or
 by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders or otherwise authorized by our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
 Under the Companies Act, the redemption or repurchase of any share may be paid out of Bilibili’s profits or out of the proceeds of a new issue of shares
 made for the purpose of such redemption or repurchase, or out of capital (including share premium account and capital redemption reserve) if Bilibili
 can, immediately following such payment, pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under the Companies Act no
 such share may be redeemed or repurchased (a) unless it is fully paid up, or (b) if such redemption or repurchase would result in there being no
 shareholders of the company holding shares other than treasury shares, or (c) if the company has commenced liquidation. In addition, Bilibili may
 accept the surrender of any fully paid share for no consideration.

       Variations of Rights of Shares. If at any time, our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class of shares
 may, subject to any rights or restrictions for the time being attached to any class of shares, only be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of
 three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class by
 the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or
 other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be materially adversely varied
 by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with such existing class of shares or with enhanced or weighted voting rights or subsequent
 to such creation or issue, the redemption or repurchase of such shares.

       Issuance of Additional Shares. Our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorizes our board of directors to
 issue additional ordinary shares from time to time as our board of directors shall determine, to the extent of available authorized but unissued shares.

        Our seventh amended and restated memorandum of articles and association also authorizes our board of directors to establish by ordinary
 resolutions from time to time one or more series of preference shares and to determine, with respect to any series of preference shares, the terms and
 rights of that series, including:
       •       the designation of the series;
       •       the number of preferred shares to constitute such series and the subscription price thereof if different from the par value thereof;
       •       the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights; and
       •       the rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.

       Our board of directors may issue preference shares without action by our shareholders to the extent authorized but unissued. Issuance of these
 shares may dilute the voting power of holders of ordinary shares.

        Inspection of Books and Records. During the period commencing from the date on which any of the securities of Bilibili first become listed on the
 Hong Kong Stock Exchange (except when the register is closed), any shareholder may inspect during business hours any register maintained in Hong
 Kong without charge and require the provision to him of copies or extracts thereof in all respects as if Bilibili were incorporated under and were subject
 to the Companies Ordinance, Cap. 622 of the Laws of Hong Kong as amended from time to time.

                                                                              153
Table of Contents

       Anti-Takeover Provisions. Some provisions of our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay
 or prevent a change of control of Bilibili or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that:
       •      authorize our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges
              and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders; and
       •      limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders.

        However, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our seventh amended and
 restated memorandum and articles of association for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of Bilibili.

       Exempted Company. We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Act. The Companies Act distinguishes between
 ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of
 the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an
 ordinary company except that an exempted company:
       •      does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;
       •      is not required to open its register of members for inspection;
       •      does not have to hold an annual general meeting;
       •      may issue shares with no par value;
       •      may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first
              instance);
       •      may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands;
       •      may register as an exempted limited duration company; and
       •      may register as a segregated portfolio company.

       “Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company
 (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other
 circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).


 C.    Material Contracts
       We have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those described in “Item 4.
 Information on the Company,” “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions,” in this “Item 10.
 Additional Information—C. Material Contracts” or elsewhere in this annual report on Form 20-F.


 D.    Exchange Controls
       See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange Control.”

 E.    Taxation
       The following summary of the material Cayman Islands, PRC and U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the ADSs or ordinary
 shares is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this registration statement, all of which are subject to change.
 This summary does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares, such as the tax consequences
 under U.S. state and local tax laws or under the tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands, China and the United States.


 Cayman Islands Taxation
        According to Walkers (Hong Kong), our Cayman counsel, the Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon
 profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material
 to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or brought within
 the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. In addition, the Cayman Islands does not impose withholding tax on dividend payments. No stamp duty is
 payable in the Cayman Islands on transfers of shares of Cayman Islands companies except those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands. The
 Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by Bilibili. There are no exchange control
 regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.

       Payments of dividends and capital in respect of the ADSs or ordinary shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no
 withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the ADSs or ordinary shares, nor will gains derived from the
 disposal of the ADSs or ordinary shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.

       Bilibili has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and, as such, has obtained an
 undertaking from the Government of the Cayman Islands as to tax concessions under the Tax Concessions Act (as amended). In accordance with the
 provision of Section 6 of The Tax Concessions Act (as amended), the Governor in Cabinet undertakes with Bilibili:
       •       that no law which is hereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall
               apply to Bilibili or its operations; and
       •       in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall
               be payable:
       •       on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of Bilibili; or
       •       by way of the withholding, in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in Section 6(3) of the Tax Concessions Act (as amended).
               These concessions shall be for a period of 20 years from March 14, 2018.


 PRC Taxation
        Under the PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management body” within China is
 considered a resident enterprise. The implementation rules define the term “de facto management body” as the body that exercises full and substantial
 control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the STA issued a
 circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled
 enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. The STA issued Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises Income Tax
 Regulation, or the Bulletin 45, which took effect on September 1, 2011 and was most recently amended on June 15, 2018, to provide more guidance on
 the implementation of Circular 82 and to clarify the reporting and filing obligations of Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated resident enterprises.
 Bulletin 45 also provides procedures and administrative details for the determination of resident status and administration of post-determination matters.
 Although Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC
 individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the STA’s general position on how the “de facto management body” text should
 be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a
 PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China only if all
 of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in China; (ii) decisions relating to the
 enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in China; (iii) the enterprise’s
 primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in China; and (iv) at
 least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in China.

                                                                               155
Table of Contents

        We believe that Bilibili Inc. is not a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. Bilibili Inc. is not controlled by a PRC enterprise or PRC
 enterprise group and we do not believe that Bilibili Inc. meets all of the conditions above. Bilibili Inc. is a company incorporated outside China. As a
 holding company, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its key assets are located, and its records (including the resolutions of
 its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained, outside China. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding
 companies with a similar corporate structure as ours ever having been deemed a PRC “resident enterprise” by the PRC tax authorities. However, the tax
 resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the
 term “de facto management body.”

       If the PRC tax authorities determine that Bilibili Inc. is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we may be required to
 withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises, including the holders of the ADSs. In
 addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) may be subject to a 10% PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other
 disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within China. It is unclear whether our non-PRC individual
 shareholders (including the ADS holders) would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends or gains obtained by such non-PRC individual shareholders in
 the event we are determined to be a PRC resident enterprise. If any PRC tax were to apply to such dividends or gains, it would generally apply at a rate
 of 20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty. However, it is also unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of Bilibili Inc. would
 be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and China in the event that Bilibili Inc. is treated as a PRC
 resident enterprise. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China— If we are classified as a PRC resident
 enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS
 holders.”


 U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
        The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of the ADSs or
 ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) that holds the ADSs or ordinary shares as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment)
 under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. This discussion is based upon existing U.S. federal tax law, which is subject to
 differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position.
 This discussion does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual
 investment circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (including for example, financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated
 investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, tax-exempt organizations
 (including private foundations), holders who are not U.S. Holders, holders who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of our stock (by
 vote or value), holders who acquire their ADSs or ordinary shares pursuant to any employee share option or otherwise as compensation, investors that
 will hold their ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income
 tax purposes, investors required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares as a result of such
 income being recognized on an applicable financial statement or investors that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, all of whom may be
 subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those discussed below). This discussion, moreover, does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift tax
 or alternative minimum tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares or the Medicare tax on net investment income.
 Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax considerations of an
 investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares.

                                                                              156
Table of Contents

       General
        For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of the ADSs or ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
 (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
 purposes) created in, or organized under the law of, the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which
 is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the
 primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or
 (B) that has otherwise validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person under the Code.

        If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of the ADSs or ordinary shares,
 the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships
 holding the ADSs or ordinary shares and their partners are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding an investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares.

       For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will generally be treated as the beneficial owner of the underlying shares
 represented by the ADSs. The remainder of this discussion assumes that a U.S. Holder of the ADSs will be treated in this manner. Accordingly, deposits
 or withdrawals of Class Z ordinary shares for ADSs will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax.


       Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations
       A non-U.S. corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i)
 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of “passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (generally
 determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.
 For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are categorized as a passive asset and the company’s goodwill and other unbooked
 intangibles are taken into account. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the
 disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any
 other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock.

        Although the law in this regard is not entirely clear, we treat the VIEs as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, because we
 control their management decisions and we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these entities, and, as a result, we
 consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we do not own the stock
 of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be treated as a PFIC for the current taxable year and any subsequent taxable year.

        Assuming that we are the owner of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we do not believe we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended
 December 31, 2021, and based upon our current income and assets, including goodwill and other unbooked intangibles not reflected on our balance
 sheet, and the value of the ADSs, we do not presently expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or in the foreseeable future. While we do not
 expect to be or become a PFIC in the current or future taxable years, no assurance can be given that we are not or will not become classified as a PFIC
 because the determination of PFIC status is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis and will depend, in part, upon the composition of our assets
 and income, and the continued existence of our goodwill at that time. Fluctuations in the market price of the ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for
 the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill and other
 unbooked intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market value of the ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). In particular, recent
 fluctuations in the market price of the ADSs increased our risk of becoming a PFIC. The market price of the ADSs may continue to fluctuate
 considerably and, consequently, we cannot assure you of our PFIC status for any taxable year. In addition, the composition of our income and our assets
 will be affected by how, and how quickly, we spend our liquid assets. Under circumstances where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of
 cash for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially increase.

                                                                              157
Table of Contents

       If we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs or ordinary shares, we will generally continue to be treated
 as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds the ADSs or ordinary shares.

        The discussion below under “Dividends” and “Sale or Other Disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares” is written on the basis that we will not be
 classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. federal income tax rules that apply if we are treated as a PFIC are generally
 discussed below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”


       Dividends
       Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” any cash distributions (including the amount of any tax
 withheld) paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax
 principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the
 U.S. Holder. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, any distribution we pay
 will generally be treated as a “dividend” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

       A non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to tax on dividend income from a “qualified foreign corporation” at a lower applicable
 capital gains rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain holding period requirements are met. A
 non-U.S. corporation (other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable
 year) will generally be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (i) if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United
 States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of
 information program, or (ii) with respect to any dividend it pays on stock (or ADSs in respect of such stock) which is readily tradable on an established
 securities market in the United States. The ADSs are considered to be readily tradable on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is an established
 securities market in the United States. Since we do not expect that our ordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market, we do not
 believe that dividends that we pay on our ordinary shares that are not represented by ADSs will meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate.
 There can be no assurance that the ADSs will continue to be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in later years.

        In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC EIT Law, we may be eligible for the benefits of the U.S.-PRC
 income tax treaty (the “Treaty”), which the U.S. Treasury Department has determined is satisfactory for this purpose, and in that case we would be
 treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on our ordinary shares, or ADSs. Each non-corporate U.S. Holder is advised to
 consult its tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income for any dividends we pay with respect
 to the ADSs or ordinary shares. Dividends received on the ADSs or ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to
 corporations.

        Dividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes and will generally constitute passive
 category income. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC EIT Law, a U.S. Holder may be subject to PRC
 withholding taxes on dividends paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares. See “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—PRC Taxation.” In that case,
 depending on the U.S. Holder’s individual facts and circumstances, a U.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a
 foreign tax credit not in excess of any applicable treaty rate in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on the ADSs or
 ordinary shares. A U.S. Holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction, for U.S. federal
 income tax purposes, in respect of such withholding, but only for a year in which such holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The
 rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex and their outcome depends in large part on the U.S. Holder’s individual facts and circumstances.
 Accordingly, U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.

                                                                             158
Table of Contents

       Sale or Other Disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares
       Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” a U.S. Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss
 upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition and
 the holder’s adjusted tax basis in such ADSs or ordinary shares. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the ADSs or ordinary shares have been held
 for more than one year and will generally be U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Long-term capital gain of non-corporate U.S.
 Holders is generally eligible for a reduced rate of taxation. The deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to limitations.

        As described in “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—PRC Taxation,” if we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT
 Law, gains from the disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares may be subject to PRC income tax and will generally be U.S.-source, which may limit
 the ability to receive a foreign tax credit. If a U.S. Holder is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty, such holder may be able to elect to treat such gain as
 PRC-source income under the Treaty. Pursuant to recently issued U.S. Treasury Regulations, however, if a U.S. Holder is not eligible for the benefits of
 the Treaty or does not elect to apply the Treaty, then such holder may not be able to claim a foreign tax credit arising from any PRC tax imposed on the
 disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares. The rules regarding foreign tax credits and deduction of foreign taxes are complex. U.S. Holders should
 consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit or deduction in light of their particular circumstances, including their
 eligibility for benefits under the Treaty, and the potential impact of the recently issued U.S. Treasury Regulations.


       Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
       If we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs or ordinary shares, and unless the U.S. Holder
 makes a mark-to-market election (as described below), the U.S. Holder will generally be subject to special tax rules that have a penalizing effect,
 regardless of whether we remain a PFIC, on (i) any excess distribution that we make to the U.S. Holder (which generally means any distribution paid
 during a taxable year to a U.S. Holder that is greater than 125 percent of the average annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or, if
 shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ADSs or ordinary shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition, including a pledge,
 of ADSs or ordinary shares. Under the PFIC rules:
       •       the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ADSs or ordinary shares;
       •       the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in the U.S. Holder’s holding period prior to the first taxable year in
               which we are classified as a PFIC (each, a “pre-PFIC year”), will be taxable as ordinary income;
       •       the amount allocated to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year, will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for
               individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that year; and
       •       the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the tax attributable to each prior taxable year, other
               than a pre-PFIC year.

       If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs or ordinary shares and any of our subsidiaries is also a PFIC,
 such U.S. Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of
 these rules. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries.

                                                                               159
Table of Contents

        As an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. Holder of “marketable stock” in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such
 stock. The mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC, or
 on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines is a qualified exchange that has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a
 legitimate and sound fair market value. The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is an established securities market in the United
 States. Consequently, if the ADSs continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and are regularly traded, we expect that the mark-to-market
 election would be available to a U.S. Holder that holds the ADSs were we to be or become a PFIC. The ADSs are expected to qualify as being regularly
 traded, but no assurances may be given in this regard. If a U.S. Holder makes this election, the holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for
 each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of
 such ADSs and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at
 the end of the taxable year, but such deduction will only be allowed to the extent of the amount previously included in income as a result of the
 mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the
 mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a corporation classified as a PFIC and such corporation ceases
 to be classified as a PFIC, the holder will not be required to take into account the gain or loss described above during any period that such corporation is
 not classified as a PFIC. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, any gain such U.S. Holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of
 the ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but such loss will only be treated
 as ordinary loss to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder makes a
 mark-to-market election it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the ADSs are no
 longer treated as marketable stock or the IRS consents to the revocation of the election. It should also be noted that it is intended that only the ADSs and
 not the ordinary shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Consequently, if a U.S. Holder holds ordinary shares that are not represented
 by ADSs, such holder will generally not be eligible to make a mark-to-market election if we are or were to become a PFIC.

       Because a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that we may own, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the
 PFIC rules with respect to such U.S. Holder’s indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S.
 federal income tax purposes.

        We do not intend to provide information necessary for U.S. Holders to make qualified electing fund elections which, if available, would result in
 tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for PFICs described above.

       If a U.S. Holder owns the ADSs or ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, the holder must generally file an annual IRS Form
 8621. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing
 ADSs or ordinary shares if we are or become treated as a PFIC, including the possibility of making a mark-to-market election.

       We are subject to periodic reporting and other informational requirements of the Exchange Act as applicable to foreign private issuers, and are
 required to file reports and other information with the SEC. Specifically, we are required to file annually an annual report on Form 20-F within four
 months after the end of each fiscal year, which is December 31. All information filed with the SEC can be obtained over the internet at the SEC’s

 quarterly reports and proxy statements, and officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery
 provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

       We will furnish Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, the depositary of the ADSs, with our annual reports, which will include a review of
 operations and annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and all notices of shareholders’ meetings and
 other reports and communications that are made generally available to our shareholders. The depositary will make such notices, reports and
 communications available to holders of ADSs and, upon our request, will mail to all record holders of ADSs the information contained in any notice of a
 shareholders’ meeting received by the depositary from us.

                                                                             160

 ITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


 Foreign exchange risk
        Substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct
 foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk. Although our exposure to foreign exchange
 risks should be limited in general, the value of the investment in the ADSs will be affected by the exchange rate between U.S. dollar and Renminbi
 because the value of our business is effectively denominated in RMB, while the ADSs will be traded in U.S. dollars.

       To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would reduce
 the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making
 payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs, servicing our outstanding debt, or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar
 against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.

       As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents and time deposits of US$2,197.0 million. If the U.S. dollar
 had appreciated or depreciated by 10% against the Renminbi, we would have had an increase or decrease of RMB1,400.7 million of cash and cash
 equivalents and time deposits.


       Interest rate risk
      Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash, which is mostly held in interest-bearing bank
 deposits. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates, and
 we have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure. However, our future interest income may fall short of
 expectations due to changes in market interest rates.

 D.    American Depositary Shares
 Fees and Expenses
       As an ADS holder, you will be required to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental charges (in
 addition to any applicable fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities represented by any of your ADSs):

                                      Service                                                                          Fees
 To any person to which ADSs are issued or to any person to which a                  Up to US$0.05 per ADS issued
 distribution is made in respect of ADS distributions pursuant to stock
 dividends or other free distributions of stock, bonus distributions, stock splits
 or other distributions (except where converted to cash)
 Cancellation of ADSs, including the case of termination of the deposit              Up to US$0.05 per ADS cancelled
 agreement
 Distribution of cash dividends                                                      Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
 Distribution of cash entitlements (other than cash dividends) and/or cash           Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
 proceeds from the sale of rights, securities and other entitlements
 Distribution of ADSs pursuant to exercise of rights                                 Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
 Distribution of securities other than ADSs or rights to purchase additional         Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
 ADSs
 Depositary services                                                                 Up to US$0.05 per ADS held on the applicable record date(s) established
                                                                                     by the depositary bank

       As an ADS holder, you will also be responsible to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary bank and certain taxes and
 governmental charges (in addition to any applicable fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities
 represented by any of your ADSs) such as:
       •       Fees for the transfer and registration of Class Z ordinary shares charged by the registrar and transfer agent for the Class Z ordinary shares
               in the Cayman Islands (i.e., upon deposit and withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares).
       •       Expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into U.S. dollars.
       •       Expenses for cable, telex and fax transmissions and for delivery of securities.
       •       Taxes and duties upon the transfer of securities, including any applicable stamp duties, any stock transfer charges or withholding taxes (i.e.,
               when Class Z ordinary shares are deposited or withdrawn from deposit).
       •       Fees and expenses incurred in connection with the delivery or servicing of Class Z ordinary shares on deposit.
       •       Fees and expenses incurred in connection with complying with exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements applicable
               to Class Z ordinary shares, deposited securities, ADSs and ADRs.
       •       Any applicable fees and penalties thereon.

        The depositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of
 their clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the
 depositary bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash
 or securities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable
 ADS record date.

                                                                               162
Table of Contents

       The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable
 property to pay the fees. In the case of distributions other than cash (i.e., share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the
 ADS record date holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or
 uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In the case of ADSs held in
 brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is
 the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who
 hold their clients’ ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients’ accounts the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.

        In the event of refusal to pay the depositary fees, the depositary bank may, under the terms of the deposit agreement, refuse the requested service
 until payment is received or may set off the amount of the depositary fees from any distribution to be made to the ADS holder.

        The depositary may make payments to us or reimburse us for certain costs and expenses, by making available a portion of the ADS fees collected
 in respect of the ADR program or otherwise, upon such terms and conditions as we and the depositary bank agree from time to time. In 2021, we were
 entitled to receive approximately US$4.3 million reimbursement from the depositary for our expenses incurred in connection with investor relationship
 programs related to the ADS facility and the travel expense in connection with such programs.


 Dealings and Settlement of Class Z Ordinary Shares in Hong Kong
       Our Class Z ordinary shares now trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in board lots of 20 ordinary shares. Dealings in our Class Z ordinary
 shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are conducted in Hong Kong dollars.

       The transaction costs of dealings in our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange include:
       •       Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading fee of 0.005% of the consideration of the transaction, charged to each of the buyer and seller;
       •       SFC transaction levy of 0.0027% of the consideration of the transaction, charged to each of the buyer and seller;
       •       trading tariff of HK$0.50 on each and every purchase or sale transaction. The decision on whether or not to pass the trading tariff onto
               investors is at the discretion of brokers;
       •       transfer deed stamp duty of HK$5.00 per transfer deed (if applicable), payable by the seller;
       •       ad valorem stamp duty at a total rate of 0.26% of the value of the transaction, with 0.13% payable by each of the buyer and the seller;
       •       stock settlement fee, which is currently 0.002% of the gross transaction value, subject to a minimum fee of HK$2.00 and a maximum fee
               of HK$100.00 per side per trade;
       •       brokerage commission, which is freely negotiable with the broker (other than brokerage commissions for IPO transactions which are
               currently set at 1% of the subscription or purchase price and will be payable by the person subscribing for or purchasing the securities);
               and
       •       the Hong Kong Share Registrar will charge between HK$2.50 to HK$20, depending on the speed of service (or such higher fee as may
               from time to time be permitted under the Hong Kong Listing Rules), for each transfer of ordinary shares from one registered owner to
               another, each share certificate canceled or issued by it and any applicable fee as stated in the share transfer forms used in Hong Kong.

        Investors must settle their trades executed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through their brokers directly or through custodians. For an investor
 who has deposited his or her Class Z ordinary shares in his or her stock account or in his or her designated CCASS participant’s stock account
 maintained with CCASS, settlement will be effected in CCASS in accordance with the General Rules of CCASS and CCASS Operational Procedures in
 effect from time to time. For an investor who holds the physical certificates, settlement certificates and the duly executed transfer forms must be
 delivered to his or her broker or custodian before the settlement date.

                                                                              163

 Conversion between Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong and ADSs
       In connection with the listing of our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we have established a branch register of
 members in Hong Kong, or the Hong Kong share register, which is maintained by our Hong Kong Share Registrar, Computershare Hong Kong Investor
 Services Limited. Our principal register of members, or the Cayman share register, continues to be maintained by our Principal Share Registrar, Walkers
 Corporate Limited.

        All Class Z ordinary shares offered in the Global Offering are registered on the Hong Kong share register in order to be listed and traded on the
 Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As described in further detail below, holders of Class Z ordinary shares registered on the Hong Kong share register are
 able to convert these shares into ADSs, and vice versa.

      In connection with our listing in Hong Kong, and to facilitate fungibility and conversion between ADSs and Class Z ordinary shares and trading
 between Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we have moved a portion of our issued Class Z ordinary shares from our register of members
 maintained in the Cayman Islands to our Hong Kong share register.


       The ADSs
       The ADSs are traded on the Nasdaq. Dealings in the ADSs on the Nasdaq are conducted in U.S. Dollars.

       ADSs may be held either:
       •      directly (a) by having an American Depositary Receipt (ADR), which is a certificate evidencing a specific number of ADSs, registered in
              the holder’s name, or (b) by holding uncertificated ADSs in the direct registration system; or
       •      indirectly, through the holder’s broker or other financial institution.

      The depositary for the ADSs is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, whose office is located at 1 Columbus Circle, 17th Floor, New York,
 NY 10019, USA.


       Converting Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong into ADSs
      An investor who holds Class Z ordinary shares registered in Hong Kong and who intends to convert them to ADSs to trade on the Nasdaq must
 deposit or have his or her broker deposit the Class Z ordinary shares with the depositary’s Hong Kong custodian, Deutsche Bank AG, Hong Kong
 Branch, or the custodian, in exchange for ADSs.

       A deposit of Class Z ordinary shares trading in Hong Kong in exchange for ADSs involves the following procedures:
       •      If Class Z ordinary shares have been deposited with CCASS, the investor must transfer ordinary shares to the depositary’s account with the
              custodian within CCASS by following the CCASS procedures for transfer and submit and deliver a duly completed and signed letter of
              transmittal to the custodian via his or her broker.
       •      If Class Z ordinary shares are held outside CCASS, the investor must arrange to deposit his or her Class Z ordinary shares into CCASS for
              delivery to the depositary’s account with the custodian within CCASS, submit and deliver a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal
              to the custodian.
       •      Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, if applicable, and
              subject in all cases to the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will issue the corresponding number of ADSs in the name(s)
              requested by an investor and will deliver the ADSs to the designated DTC account of the person(s) designated by an investor or his or her
              broker.

                                                                              164
Table of Contents

       For Class Z ordinary shares deposited in CCASS, under normal circumstances, the above steps generally require two business days, provided that
 the investor has provided timely and complete instructions. For Class Z ordinary shares held outside CCASS in physical form, the above steps may take
 14 business days, or more, to complete. Temporary delays may arise. For example, the transfer books of the depositary may from time to time be closed
 to ADS issuances. The investor will be unable to trade the ADSs until the procedures are completed.


       Converting ADSs to Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong
        An investor who holds ADSs and who intends to convert his/her ADSs into Class Z ordinary shares to trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
 must cancel the ADSs the investor holds and withdraw Class Z ordinary shares from our ADS program and cause his or her broker or other financial
 institution to trade such Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

       An investor that holds ADSs indirectly through a broker should follow the broker’s procedure and instruct the broker to arrange for cancelation of
 the ADSs, and transfer of the underlying Class Z ordinary shares from the depositary’s account with the custodian within the CCASS system to the
 investor’s Hong Kong stock account.

       For investors holding ADSs directly, the following steps must be taken:
      •       To withdraw Class Z ordinary shares from our ADS program, an investor who holds ADSs may turn in such ADSs at the office of the
              depositary (and the applicable ADR(s) if the ADSs are held in certificated form), and send an instruction to cancel such ADSs to the
              depositary. Such instructions must have a Medallion signature guarantee.
      •       Upon payment or net of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, if applicable,
              and subject in all cases to the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will instruct the custodian to deliver Class Z ordinary shares
              underlying the canceled ADSs to the CCASS account designated by an investor.
      •       If an investor prefers to receive Class Z ordinary shares outside CCASS, he or she must receive ordinary shares in CCASS first and then
              arrange for withdrawal from CCASS. Investors can then obtain a transfer form signed by HKSCC Nominees Limited (as the transferor)
              and register Class Z ordinary shares in their own names with the Hong Kong Share Registrar.

        For Class Z ordinary shares to be received in CCASS, under normal circumstances, the above steps generally require two business days, provided
 that the investor has provided timely and complete instructions. For Class Z ordinary shares to be received outside CCASS in physical form, the above
 steps may take 14 business days, or more, to complete. The investor will be unable to trade the Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock
 Exchange until the procedures are completed.

        Temporary delays may arise. For example, the transfer books of the depositary may from time to time be closed to ADS cancellations. In addition,
 completion of the above steps and procedures is subject to there being a sufficient number of Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong share registrar
 to facilitate a withdrawal from the ADS program directly into the CCASS system. We are not under any obligation to maintain or increase the number of
 Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong share register to facilitate such withdrawals.


       Depositary Requirements
       Before the depositary issues ADSs or permits withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares, the depositary may require:
      •       production of satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or other information it deems necessary; and
      •       compliance with procedures it may establish, from time to time, consistent with the deposit agreement, including, but not limited to,
              completion and presentation of transfer documents.

                                                                            165
Table of Contents

       The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer, or register issuances, transfers and cancelations of ADSs generally when the transfer books of the
 depositary or our Hong Kong or Cayman Share Registrar are closed or at any time if the depositary or we determine it advisable to do so, subject to such
 refusal complying with U.S. federal securities laws.

        All costs attributable to the transfer of Class Z ordinary shares to effect a withdrawal from or deposit of Class Z ordinary shares into our ADS
 program will be borne by the investor requesting the transfer. In particular, holders of Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs should note that the Hong Kong
 Share Registrar will charge between HK$2.50 to HK$20, depending on the speed of service (or such higher fee as may from time to time be permitted
 under the Hong Kong Listing Rules), for each transfer of Class Z ordinary shares from one registered owner to another, each share certificate canceled
 or issued by it and any applicable fee as stated in the share transfer forms used in Hong Kong. In addition, holders of Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs
 must pay up to US$5.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs for each issuance of ADSs and each cancelation of ADSs, as the case may be, in connection with the
 deposit of Class Z ordinary shares into, or withdrawal of ordinary shares from, our ADS program.

                                                                           166

       See “Item 10. Additional Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association—Ordinary Shares” for a description of the rights of
 securities holders, which remain unchanged.


 Use of Proceeds
        We filed F-1 Registration Statement in relation to our initial public offering of 42,000,000 ADSs representing 42,000,000 Class Z ordinary shares,
 at an initial offering price of US$11.50 per ADS Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P.
 Morgan Securities LLC were the representatives of the underwriters for our IPO.

        The F-1 Registration Statement became effective on March 27, 2018. For the period from the effective date of the F-1 Registration Statement to
 December 31, 2018, the total expenses incurred for our company’s account in connection with our IPO was approximately US$39.7 million, which
 included US$33.8 million in underwriting discounts and commissions for the IPO and approximately US$5.9 million in other costs and expenses for our
 IPO. We received net proceeds of approximately US$443.3 million from our initial public offering. None of the transaction expenses included payments
 to directors or officers of our company or their associates, persons owning more than 10% or more of our equity securities or our affiliates. None of the
 net proceeds from the initial public offering were paid, directly or indirectly, to any of our directors or officers or their associates, persons owning 10%
 or more of our equity securities or our affiliates.

        For the period from March 27, 2018, the date that the Form F-1 was declared effective by the SEC, to December 31, 2021, we used all of the net
 proceeds from our initial public offering for research and development, sales and marketing, general corporate purposes and working capital, including
 strategic investments and acquisitions.


 ITEM 15. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures
       Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we
 carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, which is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of
 December 31, 2021. Based upon that evaluation, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has
 concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
 we file or submit under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
 forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act was accumulated and
 communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
 required disclosure.


 Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15 (f)
 under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the
 effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded
 that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.

                                                                             167
Table of Contents

       Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
 evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
 degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.


 Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
       PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 as
 stated in its report, which appears on page F-2 of this annual report on Form 20-F.


 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
       Other than as described above, there were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period
 covered by this annual report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
 reporting.

 ITEM 16D. EXEMPTIONS FROM THE LISTING STANDARDS FOR AUDIT COMMITTEES

       None.


 ITEM 16E. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS

       In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, there has not been any purchase made by or on behalf of the issuer or any “affiliated purchase,” as
 defined in §240.10b-18(a)(3), of shares or other units of any class of the issuer’s equity securities that is registered by the issuer pursuant to section 12 of
 the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781).

        On March 3, 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to US$500 million of the
 ADSs for the next 24 months. The proposed repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately
 negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with
 applicable rules and regulations. We plan to fund the repurchases from our existing cash balance. In addition, Mr. Rui Chen has informed us of his
 intention to use his personal funds to purchase up to US$10 million of the ADSs in the open market for the next 24 months.


 ITEM 16F. CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
       Not applicable.


 ITEM 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
        Rule 5635(c) of the Nasdaq Rules requires a Nasdaq-listed company to obtain its shareholders’ approval of all equity compensation plans,
 including stock plans, and any material amendments to such plans. Rule 5615 of the Nasdaq Rules permits a foreign private issuer like our company to
 follow home country practice in certain corporate governance matters. We currently follow our home country practice that does not require us to seek
 shareholder approval for amending share incentive plans. Therefore, our shareholders are afforded less protection than they otherwise would under the
 Nasdaq Global Market corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—
 Risks Related to Our Listed Securities—As a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in
 relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards, and these practices may afford
 less protection to shareholders than shareholders would enjoy if we complied fully with the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.” In the
 future, we may rely on other exemptions provided by Nasdaq.


 ITEM 16H. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE

 ITEM 16I. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS.

                                               Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bilibili Inc.


 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bilibili Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three
 years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also
 have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
 December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in
 conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
 respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
 Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.


 Basis for Opinions
 The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
 reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual
 Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated
 financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
 the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
 accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
 effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
 financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
 basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
 principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
 Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
 that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
 audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
 basis for our opinions.

                                                                              F-2

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
 reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
 recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
 expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
 material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
 of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
 compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


 Critical Audit Matters
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
 communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
 financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does
 not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter
 below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.


 Revenue recognition for in-game virtual items
 As described in Note 2(v) to the consolidated financial statements, revenues from mobile game services were RMB5,090.9 million for the year ended
 December 31, 2021. The Company recognized revenue from the sale of in-game virtual items in exclusively distributed mobile games over the
 estimated average playing period of paying players, starting from the point-in-time when related in-game virtual items are delivered to the paying
 players’ accounts. The Company has estimated the average playing period of paying players for each game, usually between two to nine months.
 Management estimated the average playing period of paying players for each game, which involved the use of assumptions, including the churn rates
 and the similarities between newly-launched games and existing games, such as paying player type and purchasing frequency, when a new game is
 launched and only a limited period of paying player data is available.

                                                                             F-3
Table of Contents

 The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for in-game virtual items is a critical audit
 matter is the significant judgment by management in estimating the average playing period of paying players. This in turn led to significant auditor
 judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating management’s assumptions used in developing these estimates, including
 the churn rates and the similarities between newly-launched games and existing games.

 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
 consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including
 controls over the estimation of the average playing period of paying players for each game. These procedures also included, among others, testing
 management’s process to estimate the average playing period of paying players by (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used; (ii) testing the
 mathematic accuracy of the calculation; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the churn rates with reference to historical data, and the
 reasonableness of the underlying assumption of the similarities between newly-launched games and existing games based on the characteristics of
 mobile games and playing patterns of paying players, including paying player type and purchasing frequency.

 1.    Operations (Continued)

       Contractual agreements with major VIEs
        In order to comply with the PRC laws and regulations which prohibit or restrict foreign control of companies involved in provision of internet
 content services, the Group operates its restricted businesses in the PRC through its VIEs, whose equity interests are held by certain founders of the
 Group. The Company obtained control over these VIEs by entering into a series of contractual arrangements with the legal shareholders who are also
 referred to as nominee shareholders. These nominee shareholders are the legal owners of the VIEs. However, the rights of those nominee shareholders
 have been transferred to the Company through the contractual arrangements.

       The contractual arrangements that are used to control the VIEs include powers of attorney, exclusive technology consulting and services
 agreements or exclusive business cooperation agreements, equity pledge agreements and exclusive option agreements. Management concluded that the
 Company, through the contractual arrangements, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance,
 bears the risks of and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the VIEs, and therefore the Company is the ultimate primary
 beneficiary of these VIEs. As such, the Company consolidates the financial statements of these VIEs. Consequently, the financial results of the VIEs
 were included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the presentation as stated in Note 2(a).

       The following is a summary of the contractual agreements entered into by and among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, the VIEs, and
 respective nominee shareholders of the VIEs.

       Exclusive Technology Consulting and Services Agreements. Under the exclusive technology consulting and services agreements between the
 Company’s relevant subsidiaries and the VIEs, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries have the exclusive right to provide the VIEs consulting and services
 related to, among other things, research and development, system operation, advertising, internal training and technical support. The Company’s relevant
 subsidiaries have the exclusive ownership of intellectual property rights created as a result of the performance of these agreements. These VIEs shall pay
 the Company’s relevant subsidiaries an annual service fee, which are subject to the adjustment by the Company’s relevant subsidiaries at its sole
 discretion. These agreements will remain effective for a 10 year’s term and then be automatically renewed, unless the Company’s relevant subsidiaries
 give the VIEs a termination notice 90 days before the term ends. On December 23, 2020, the above agreements were replaced by the exclusive business
 cooperation agreements, which contain terms substantially similar to the exclusive business cooperation agreements described above, the exclusive
 business cooperation agreements have an infinite period commencing from December 23, 2020, unless the Company’s relevant subsidiaries give the
 VIEs a termination notice 30 days before the term ends.

                                                                           F-14

       Contractual agreements with major VIEs (Continued)

        Exclusive Option Agreements. Pursuant to the exclusive purchase option agreement, among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, the VIEs and its
 nominee shareholders, each of the nominee shareholders of the VIEs irrevocably granted the Company’s relevant subsidiaries an exclusive option to
 purchase, or have its designated person to purchase, at its discretion, to the extent permitted under PRC law, all or part of their equity interests in the
 VIEs, and the purchase price shall be the lowest price permitted by applicable PRC law. In addition, the VIEs irrevocably granted the Company’s
 relevant subsidiaries an exclusive option to purchase, or have its designated person to purchase, at its discretion, to the extent permitted under PRC law,
 all or part of the VIEs’ assets at the book value of such assets, or at the lowest price permitted by applicable PRC law, whichever is higher. The nominee
 shareholders of the VIEs undertake that, without the prior written consent of the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, they shall not increase or decrease the
 registered capital, dispose of its assets, incur any debts or guarantee liabilities, enter into any material purchase agreements, conduct any merger,
 acquisition or investments, amend its articles of association or provide any loans to third parties. The exclusive option agreements will remain effective
 until all equity interests in the VIEs held by their nominee shareholders and all assets of the VIEs are transferred or assigned to the Company’s relevant
 subsidiaries or its designated representatives.

        Powers of Attorney. Pursuant to the powers of attorney, each of the nominee shareholders of the VIEs, executed a power of attorney to irrevocably
 appoint the Company’s relevant subsidiaries or its designated person as nominee shareholder’s attorney-in-fact to exercise all of the rights as a
 shareholder of the VIEs, including, but not limited to, the right to convene and attend shareholders’ meeting, vote on any resolution that requires a
 shareholder vote, such as the appointment or removal of directors and executive officers, other voting rights pursuant to the then-effective articles of
 association of the VIEs and transfer of VIE’s assets. The powers of attorney will remain in force for so long as the nominee shareholders remain
 shareholders of the VIEs. The powers of attorney were amended on December 23, 2020, which were extended the life to an indefinite terms
 commencing from December 23, 2020 and will be terminated in the event that (i) the power of attorney is unilaterally terminated by the Company’s
 relevant subsidiaries; or (ii)it is legally permissible for the Company or any of the subsidiaries to hold equity interests directly or indirectly in VIEs or
 their designated person is registered to be the sole shareholder of VIEs.

       Equity Pledge Agreements. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, the VIEs and its nominee
 shareholders, the nominee shareholders of the VIEs pledged all of their equity interests in the VIEs to guarantee their and the VIEs’ performance of their
 obligations under the contractual arrangements. In the event of a breach by the VIEs or the VIEs’ shareholders of contractual obligations under these
 agreements, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, as pledgee, will be entitled the right to dispose of the pledged equity interests in the VIEs. The
 nominee shareholders of the VIEs also undertake that, during the term of the equity pledge agreements, they shall not dispose of the pledged equity
 interests or create or allow any encumbrance on the pledged equity interests. During the term of the equity pledge agreements, the Company’s relevant
 subsidiaries has the right to receive all of the dividends and profits distributed on the pledged equity interests. The pledge will remain binding until the
 VIEs and their nominee shareholders discharge all their obligations under the contractual arrangements.

                                                                             F-15

 1.    Operations (Continued)

       Risks in relation to the VIE structure
        A significant part of the Group’s business is conducted through the VIEs of the Group, of which the Company is the ultimate primary beneficiary.
 In the opinion of management, the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and the nominee shareholders are in compliance with PRC laws and
 regulations and are legally binding and enforceable. The nominee shareholders are also shareholders of the Group and have indicated they will not act
 contrary to the contractual arrangements. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and
 regulations including those that govern the contractual arrangements, which could limit the Group’s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements
 and if the nominee shareholders of the VIE were to reduce their interests in the Group, their interest may diverge from that of the Group and that may
 potentially increase the risk that they would seek to act contrary to the contractual arrangements.

      On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, effective on January 1, 2020. The Foreign Investment
 Law has a catch-all provision under the definition of “foreign investment” which includes investments made by foreign investors in China through
 means stipulated in laws or administrative regulations or other methods prescribed by the State Council. In the event that the State Council in the future
 promulgates laws and regulations that deem investments made by foreign investors through contractual arrangements as “foreign investment,” the
 Group’s ability to use the contractual arrangements with its VIEs and the Group’s ability to conduct business through the VIEs could be severely limited.

                                                                           F-16

       Risks in relation to the VIE structure (continued)

      The Company’s ability to control the VIEs also depends on the powers of attorney the founders have to vote on all matters requiring shareholder
 approval in the VIEs. As noted above, the Company believes these powers of attorney are legally enforceable but may not be as effective as direct equity
 ownership.

      In addition, if the Group’s corporate structure or the contractual arrangements with the VIEs were found to be in violation of any existing or future
 PRC laws and regulations, the PRC regulatory authorities could, within their respective jurisdictions:
       •      revoke the Group’s business and/or operating licenses;
       •      impose fines on the Group;
       •      confiscate any of the Group’s income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations;
       •      discontinue or place restrictions or onerous conditions on the Group’s operations
       •      restrict the Group’s right to collect revenues;
       •      shut down the Group’s servers or block the Group’s app/websites;
       •      require the Group to restructure the operations, re-apply for the necessary licenses or relocate the Group’s businesses, staff and assets;
       •      impose additional conditions or requirements with which the Group may not be able to comply; or
       •      take other regulatory or enforcement actions against the Group that could be harmful to the Group’s business.

       The imposition of any of these restrictions or actions could result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to conduct its business. In
 such case, the Group may not be able to operate or control the VIEs, which may result in deconsolidation of the VIEs in the Group’s consolidated
 financial statements. In the opinion of management, the likelihood for the Group to lose such ability is remote based on current facts and circumstances.
 The Group believes that the contractual arrangements among each of the VIEs, their respective individual shareholders and relevant wholly foreign-
 owned enterprises are in compliance with PRC law and are legally enforceable. The Group’s operations depend on the VIEs to honor their contractual
 arrangements with the Group. These contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and disputes arising out of these agreements are expected to be
 decided by arbitration in the PRC. Management believes that each of the contractual arrangements constitutes valid and legally binding obligations of
 each party to such contractual arrangements under PRC laws. However, the interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations in the PRC
 and their application on the legality, binding effect and enforceability of contracts are subject to the discretion of competent PRC authorities, and
 therefore there is no assurance that relevant PRC authorities will take the same position as the Group herein in respect of the legality, binding effect and
 enforceability of each of the contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve, the interpretations of many laws,
 regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal
 protections available to the Group to enforce the contractual arrangements should the VIEs or the nominee shareholders of the VIEs fail to perform their
 obligations under those arrangements. Conflicts of interest may arise between the roles of them as shareholders, directors or officers of Group and as
 shareholders of the VIEs.

                                                                            F-17

       In accordance with various contractual agreements, the Company has the power to direct the activities of the VIEs and can have assets transferred
 out of the VIEs. Therefore, the Company considers that there are no assets in the respective VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the
 respective VIEs, except for the registered capital of the VIEs amounting to RMB92.1 million and RMB494.1 million, as of December 31, 2020 and
 2021, as well as certain non-distributable statutory reserves amounting to RMB17.9 million and RMB22.6 million, respectively, as of December 31,
 2020 and 2021. As the respective VIEs are incorporated as limited liability companies under the PRC Company Law, creditors do not have recourse to
 the general credit of the Company for the liabilities of the respective VIEs. There is currently no contractual arrangement that would require the
 Company to provide additional financial support to the VIEs. As the Group is conducting certain businesses in the PRC through the VIEs, the Group
 may provide additional financial support on a discretionary basis in the future, which could expose the Group to a loss.

       There is no VIE in the Group where the Company or any subsidiary has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary.


       Liquidity
        The Group incurred net losses of RMB1,303.6 million, RMB3,054.0 million and RMB6,808.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019,
 2020 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB194.6 million, RMB753.1 million for the years ended December 31,
 2019 and 2020, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was RMB2,647.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Accumulated
 deficit was RMB7,175.3 million and RMB13,971.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The Group assesses its liquidity by its
 ability to generate cash from operating activities and attract investors’ investments. Historically, the Group has relied principally on both operational
 sources of cash and non-operational sources of financing from investors to fund its operations and business development. The Group’s ability to
 continue as a going concern is dependent on management’s ability to successfully execute its business plan, which includes increasing revenues while
 controlling operating expenses, as well as, generating operational cash flows and continuing to gain support from outside sources of financing. In the
 past, the Group has been continuously receiving financing support from outside investors. In 2018, the Company completed its IPO, raising
 US$443.3 million (RMB2,781.8 million), and issued 25,063,451 Class Z Ordinary Shares to Tencent with net proceed of US$317.2 million
 (RMB2,170.8 million). In 2019, the Company completed its offering of convertible senior notes due April 2026 (the “April 2026 Notes”) and the
 Primary Offering, raising US$733.9 million (RMB5,003.8 million), after deducting commissions and offering expenses. In 2020, the Company
 completed an offering of convertible senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) raising US$786.1 million (RMB5,594.8 million), after deducting
 commissions and offering expenses, and the Company issued 17,310,696 Class Z Ordinary Shares to Sony Corporation of America (“SCA”), a wholly
 owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation (“Sony”), raising US$399.4 million (RMB2,817.5 million), after deducting offering expenses. In 2021, the
 Company successfully listed its Class Z ordinary shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raising HKD22.9 billion (RMB19.3
 billion), after deducting commissions and offering expenses, and the Company completed an offering of convertible senior notes due December 2026
 (the “December 2026 Notes”), raising US$1,576.6 million (RMB10.1 billion), after deducting commissions and offering expenses. Moreover, the Group
 can adjust the pace of its operation expansion and control the operating expenses. Based on the above considerations, the Group believes the cash and
 cash equivalents and the operating cash flows are sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations and other commitments for at least
 the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been
 prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

 2.    Significant Accounting Policies
 a)    Basis of presentation
      The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the
 United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

      Significant accounting policies followed by the Group in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized
 below.


 b)    Principles of consolidation
      The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs for which the Company is the
 primary beneficiary.

      Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Company, directly or indirectly, controls more than one half of the voting power, has the power to
 appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of the board of directors, or has the
 power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders.

       A consolidated VIE is an entity in which the Company’s subsidiary, through contractual arrangements, has the power to direct the activities that
 most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, bears the risks of and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity,
 and therefore the Company’s subsidiary is the primary beneficiary of the entity.

       All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation.

                                                                            F-20

 2.    Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 c)    Use of estimates
       The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with the U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported revenues
 and expenses during the reported periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant accounting estimates include, but
 are not limited to, determination of the average playing period for paying players, and assessment for the impairment of long-term investments
 accounted for using the measurement alternative.


 d)    Functional currency and foreign currency translation
        The Group uses Renminbi (“RMB”) as its reporting currency. The Company and several of its overseas subsidiaries use US$ or their respective
 local currencies as their functional currency. The functional currency of the Group’s PRC entities is RMB.

        In the consolidated financial statements, the financial information of the Company and other entities located outside of the PRC have been
 translated into RMB. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date, equity amounts are translated at historical
 exchange rates, and revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as
 foreign currency translation adjustments, and are shown as a component of other comprehensive income/(loss) on the consolidated statements of
 operations and comprehensive loss.

       Foreign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the
 exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
 functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are
 included in exchange gains/(losses) on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.


 e)    Convenience Translation
       Translations of balances on the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and consolidated
 statements of cash flows from RMB into US$ as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 are solely for the convenience of the reader and were
 calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB 6.3726, representing the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of RMB as certified for
 customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on December 30, 2021. No representation is made that the RMB amounts represent or
 could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on December 30, 2021, or at any other rate.

                                                                             F-21

 f)    Fair value measurements
       Financial instruments
       Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
 transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or
 permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers
 assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

        Accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
 unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
 input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
                     a.     Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
                     b.     Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
                            observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
                            identical asset or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-
                            derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by,
                            observable market data.
                     c.     Level 3 applies to asset or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant
                            to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

       The Group’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, accounts receivable, amounts due from/to related parties,
 short-term investments, and accounts payable, short-term loans, accrual liabilities and other payables of which the carrying values approximate their fair
 values. Please see Note 22 for additional information.

                                                                             F-22

 2.    Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 g)    Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits
       Cash and cash equivalents mainly represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with large reputable banks in the United States of America and
 China, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with original maturities from the date of purchase with
 terms of three months or less. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there were cash on hand and demand deposits with terms of and less than three
 months denominated in U.S. dollars amounting to approximately US$582.2 million and US$999.9 million, respectively (equivalent to approximately
 RMB3,798.5 million and RMB6,375.1 million, respectively). As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Group had cash held in accounts managed by
 online payment platforms such as Alipay and Paypal in connection with the collection of online service fees for a total amount of RMB42.0 million and
 RMB50.7 million, respectively, which have been classified as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets.

        As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Group had approximately RMB2,144.5 million and RMB1,554.5 million cash and cash equivalents held
 by its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, representing 46% and 21% of total cash and cash equivalents of the Group, respectively.

       Time deposits represent deposits placed with banks with original maturities more than three months but less than one year. As of December 31,
 2020 and 2021, there were time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars amounting to approximately US$721.1 million and US$1,197.1 million,
 respectively (equivalent to approximately RMB4,705.1 million and RMB7,632.3 million, respectively).

       The Group had no other lien arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Group
 had no restricted cash balance.


 h)    Receivables, net
      Prior to January 1, 2020, the Group monitors the collection of its receivables and records allowance for specifically identified non-recoverable
 amounts. If the economic situation and the financial condition of a customer deteriorate resulting in an impairment of the customer’s ability to make
 payments, additional allowances might be required. Receivable balances are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible.

       Starting from January 1, 2020, the Group adopted ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
 Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASC Topic 326”), which amends previously issued guidance regarding the impairment of financial instruments by
 creating an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The Group used a modified retrospective approach with a
 cumulative-effect increase of approximately RMB17.9 million recorded in accumulated deficit.

      The Group’s accounts receivable and other receivables recorded in prepayments and other current assets are within the scope of ASC Topic 326.
 Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables from advertising customers, and receivables from distribution channels.

       To estimate expected credit losses, the Group has identified the relevant risk characteristics of its customers and the related receivables and other
 receivables which include size, type of the services or the products the Group provides, or a combination of these characteristics. Receivables with
 similar risk characteristics have been grouped into pools. For each pool, the Group considers the past collection experience, current economic
 conditions, future economic conditions (external data and macroeconomic factors) and changes in the Group’s customer collection trends. This is
 assessed at each quarter based on the Group’s specific facts and circumstances. No significant impact of changes in the assumptions since adoption.

                                                                             F-23

 i)   Inventories, net
        Inventories, mainly represent products for the Group’s e-commerce business, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on the
 consolidated balance sheets. Cost of inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. Adjustments are recorded to write down the cost
 of inventories to the estimated net realizable value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as
 historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Group takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased.
 Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Certain costs attributable to buying
 and receiving products, such as purchase freights, are included in cost of inventories.


 j)   Property and equipment, net
       Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
 method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated
 useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the
 disposal of property and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized on
 the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

                                                                           F-24

 k)    Intangible assets, net
       Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions are recognized as assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-
 legal” or “separability” criterion. Purchased intangible assets are initially recognized and measured at fair value. Major identifiable intangible assets that
 have determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method as follows:

            Licensed copyrights of content shorter of the licensed period or projected useful life of the content, mainly vary from 1 to 8 years
            License rights of mobile games shorter of the licensed period or projected useful life of mobile games, mainly vary from 1 to 3
                                             years
            Intellectual property and others 1 to 10 years, based on the underlying intangible assets expected to contribute to the future cash
                                             flows

      If expectations of the usefulness of the content are revised downward, the unamortized cost is written down to the fair value, which establishes a
 new cost basis.


 l)    Goodwill
        Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
 liabilities assumed from the acquired entity as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. Goodwill is
 not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, and between annual tests when an event or
 circumstances change occurs that indicate the asset might be impaired. Under ASC 350-20-35, the Group has the option to choose whether it will apply
 the qualitative assessment first and then the quantitative assessment, if necessary, or to apply the quantitative assessment directly.

        The Group applies the quantitative impairment test, which consists of a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step was comparing the
 carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the
 reporting unit, goodwill was not impaired and the Group was not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds
 the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Group must perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test to measure the
 amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.

       On January 1, 2020, the Group adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment to simplify the test for goodwill
 impairment by removing Step 2, which was issued by the FASB in January 2017. The Group, therefore, performs the goodwill impairment test by
 comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying
 amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This adoption did not have a material impact on
 the consolidated financial statements.

        Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning
 assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimated fair
 value of reporting unit is determined using either an income approach or a market approach, when appropriate. The judgment in estimating the fair value
 of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these
 estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. The Group as a whole is determined to be one
 reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. The Group applied the quantitative assessment and performed the goodwill impairment test by
 quantitatively comparing the fair values of the reporting unit to its carrying amounts. The Group determines the fair value of the reporting unit based on
 its quoted stock price, and no impairment charge was recognized for any of the periods presented.

                                                                             F-25

 m)    Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill
       Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market
 conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life is
 shorter than the Group had originally estimated. When these events occur, the Group evaluates the impairment for the long-lived assets by comparing
 the carrying value of the assets to an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual
 disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets, the Group recognizes an impairment
 loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value of the assets.


 n)    Research and development expenses
      Research and development expenses mainly consist of payroll-related expenses incurred for the innovation of video function, development and
 enhancement to the Group’s websites and platforms of applications and development of online games.

       For internal use software, the Group expenses all costs incurred for the preliminary project stage and post implementation-operation stage of
 development, and costs associated with repair or maintenance of the existing platforms. Costs incurred in the application development stage are
 capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life. Since the amount of the Group’s research and development expenses qualifying for
 capitalization has been immaterial, as a result, all development costs incurred for development of internal used software have been expensed as incurred.

       For external use software, costs incurred for development of external use software have not been capitalized since the inception of the Group,
 because the period after the date technical feasibility is reached and the time when the software is marketed is short historically, and the amount of costs
 qualifying for capitalization has been immaterial.


 o)    Sales and marketing expenses
       Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional expenses, salaries and other compensation-related expenses to the
 Group’s sales and marketing personnel. Marketing and promotional expenses consist primarily of costs for the promotion of corporate image and
 product marketing. The Group expenses all marketing and promotion costs as incurred and classifies these costs under sales and marketing expenses.
 For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the marketing and promotional expenses were RMB934.7 million, RMB3,006.0 million and
 RMB5,102.9 million, respectively.


 p)    General and administrative expenses
      General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other compensation-related expenses to the Group’s general and
 administrative personnel, professional fees, rental expenses and allowance for doubtful accounts.

                                                                              F-26

 q)    Leases
        On January 1, 2019, the Group adopted ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which requires a lessee to recognize operating and financing
 lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. The group recognized the right-of-use assets recorded in “Other long-term
 assets” and corresponding short-term leasing liabilities recorded in “Accrued liabilities and other payables” and long-term leasing liabilities recorded in
 “Other long-term liabilities” respectively on the consolidated balance sheet.

        The Group elected to apply practical expedients permitted under the transition method that allow the Group not recognize lease assets and lease
 liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less, to not separate non-lease components from lease components, and to not reassess lease
 classification, treatment of initial direct costs, or whether an existing or expired contract contains a lease. Under ASC 842, the Group determines if an
 arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the present value
 of remaining lease payments over the lease terms. The Group considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of lease
 commencement.

       The Group leases office space and staff quarters under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, which expire at various dates through 2026. As
 of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Group’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.1 years and 2.7 years and a weighted
 average discount rate of 4.75% and 4.75%, respectively. Future lease payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:

                                                                                                                  December 31, 2021

       Operating lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 was RMB79.4 million, RMB107.2 million and RMB177.4 million,
 respectively, which excluded cost of short-term contracts. Short-term lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 was immaterial.
 Supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases was as follows:

                                                                                                           For the Year Ended December 31,

 r)   Share-based compensation
       Share based compensation expenses arise from share-based awards, including share options for the purchase of the Company’s ordinary shares.
 The Group accounts for share-based awards granted to employees in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation and share-based
 awards granted to nonemployees in accordance with ASC 505. The Group accounts for share-based awards granted to non-employees in accordance
 with ASU 2018-07, which are similar to the model for employee awards.

       For share options for the purchase of ordinary shares granted to employees determined to be equity classified awards, the related share-based
 compensation expenses are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values which are calculated using the
 binomial option pricing model. The determination of the fair value is affected by the share price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex
 and subjective variables, including the expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.

       For share options granted with service conditions only, share-based compensation expenses are recorded net of estimated forfeitures using
 straight-line method during the requisite service period, such that expenses are recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to
 ultimately vest.

       For share options granted with service condition and the occurrence of an US IPO as performance condition, share-based compensation expenses
 are recorded net of estimated forfeitures using graded-vesting method during the requisite service period.

                                                                           F-28

 s)    Employee benefits
       PRC Contribution Plan
       Full time employees of the Group in the PRC participate in a government mandated defined contribution plan, pursuant to which certain pension
 benefits, medical care, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to the employees. Chinese labor regulations require that the PRC
 subsidiaries and VIEs of the Group make contributions to the government for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees’ salaries, up
 to a maximum amount specified by the local government. The Group has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made.


 t)    Investments
       Short-term investments
       Short-term investments primarily include money market funds, financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of
 underlying assets issued by commercial banks or other financial institutions and publicly traded companies with the intention to be sold within twelve
 months.

        In accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, for financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying
 assets, the Group elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carries these investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
 these investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as “Investment income/(loss), net (including
 impairments)”. Fair value is estimated based on quoted prices of similar products provided by financial institutions at the end of each reporting period.

                                                                             F-29

 t)    Investments (Continued)

       Short-term investments (continued)
        For the investments in publicly traded companies, the Group carries the investments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in
 the fair value of these investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as “Investment income/(loss), net
 (including impairments)”.


       Long-term investments, net
      The Group’s long-term investments primarily consist of equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative, equity investments
 accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at fair value.


       Equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative
      For those investments over which the Group does not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair value, the Group records
 them at cost, less impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes (referred to as the measurement alternative).
 Under this measurement alternative, changes in the carrying value of the equity investments are required to be made whenever there are observable price
 changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

        Management regularly evaluates the impairment of these investments based on performance and financial position of the investee as well as other
 evidence of market value. Such evaluation includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investee’s cash position, recent financing, projected and
 historical financial performance, cash flow forecasts and financing needs. An impairment loss recognized equals to the excess of the investment cost
 over its fair value at the end of each reporting period for which the assessment is made. The fair value would then become the new cost basis of
 investment.


       Equity investments accounted for using the equity method
        The Group applies the equity method of accounting to account for equity investments and limited partnership in a private equity fund, according
 to ASC 323 Investment—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, over which it has significant influence but does not own a majority equity interest or
 otherwise control. Under the equity method, the Group initially records the investments at cost and the difference between the cost of the equity investee
 and the fair value of the underlying equity in the net assets of the equity investee is recognized as equity method goodwill, which is included in the
 equity method investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Group subsequently adjusts the carrying amount of the investments to recognize its
 proportionate share of each equity investee’s net income or loss into earnings and cash distributions from investees, after the date of investment. The
 Group evaluates the equity method investments for impairment under ASC 323. An impairment loss on the equity method investments is recognized as
 “Investment income/(loss), net (including impairments)” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss when the decline in value
 is determined to be other-than-temporary.


       Investments accounted for at fair value
        In accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, for financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying
 assets and with original maturities greater than one year, the Group elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carries these
 investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
 loss as “Investment income/(loss), net (including impairments)”. Fair value is estimated based on quoted prices of similar products provided by financial
 institutions at the end of each reporting period. The Group classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 2 of fair value
 measurements. Please see Note 22 for additional information.

                                                                           F-30

 u)    Taxation
       Income taxes
        Current income taxes are provided on the basis of income/(loss) for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are
 not assessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions. Deferred income taxes are
 provided using the assets and liabilities method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
 differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
 bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes. The effect on
 deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period of change. A
 valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more-likely-than-not that some portion of, or all of the
 deferred tax assets will not be realized.


       Uncertain tax positions
        In order to assess uncertain tax positions, the Group applies a more-likely-than-not threshold and a two-step approach for the tax position
 measurement and financial statement recognition. Under the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
 determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained, including resolution of related
 appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likelihood of being
 realized upon settlement. The Group recognizes interest and penalties, if any, under accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its consolidated
 balance sheets and under income tax expenses in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Group did not have any
 significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Group also did not expect any
 significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax liability within 12 months following the reporting date.


 v)    Revenue recognition
       Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration
 the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Group identifies its contracts with customers and all performance obligations
 within those contracts. The Group then determines the transaction price and allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations within the
 Group’s contracts with customers, recognizing revenue when, or as, the Group satisfies its performance obligations.

                                                                                F-31

 v)    Revenue recognition (continued)

       The Group’s revenue recognition policies effective upon the adoption of ASC 606 are as follows:


       Mobile game services
       Exclusively distributed mobile games
       For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Group primarily generates revenues from the sale of in-game virtual items to enhance
 the game-playing experience.

       In accordance with ASC 606, the Group evaluates the contracts with its customers and determines that the Group has a single performance
 obligation which is to make the game and the ongoing game related services available to the paying players. The transaction price, which is the amount
 paid for in-game virtual items by the paying player, is allocated entirely to this single performance obligation. The Group recognizes revenue from
 in-game virtual items over the estimated average playing period of paying players, starting from the point-in-time when related in-game virtual items are
 delivered to the paying players’ accounts.

        The Group has estimated the average playing period of the paying players for each game, usually between two to nine months. The Group
 considers the average period that players typically play the games and other game player behavior patterns, as well as various other factors to arrive at
 the best estimates for the estimated playing period of the paying players. To compute the estimated average playing period for paying players, the Group
 considers the initial purchase date as the starting point of a paying player’s lifespan. The Group tracks populations of paying players who made their
 initial purchases during the interval period (the “Cohort”) and tracks each Cohort to understand the subsequent churn rate of the paying players of each
 Cohort, i.e. the number of paying players from each Cohort who left subsequent to their initial purchases. To determine the ending point of a paying
 player’s lifespan beyond the date for which observable data are available, the Group extrapolates the actual observed churn rate to arrive at an estimated
 weighted average playing lifespan for paying players of the selected games. If a new game is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is
 available, then the Group considers other qualitative factors, such as the playing patterns for paying players for other games with similar characteristics
 with the new game, including paying player type and purchasing frequency. While the Group believes its estimates to be reasonable based on available
 game player information, the Group may revise such estimates based on new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns and
 any adjustments are applied prospectively.

         In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-39, the Group assesses whether it acts as the principal or as an agent in the arrangement with each party
 respectively. The Group records revenue generated from exclusively distributed mobile games on a gross basis as the Group is acting as the principal to
 fulfill all obligations related to the mobile game operations. The Group is responsible for the launch of the games, hosting and maintenance of game
 servers, and determination of when and how to operate the in-game promotions and customer services. The Group is also determining the pricing of
 in-game virtual items and making a localized version for overseas licensed games.

        Proceeds earned from selling in-game virtual items are shared between the Group and the third-party game developers, with the amount paid to
 the third-party game developers generally calculated based on amounts paid by paying players, after deducting the fees paid to the payment channels
 and the distribution channels. Fees paid to third-party game developers, distribution channels and payment channels are recorded as “Cost of revenues”
 on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

                                                                            F-32

       Mobile game services (continued)

       Jointly operated mobile game distribution services
       The Group is also offering distribution services for mobile games developed by the third-party game developers. In accordance with ASC 606, the
 Group evaluates the contracts with the third-party game developers and identifies the performance obligations as distributing games and providing
 payment solution and market promotion service to the game developers. Accordingly, the Group earns service revenue by distributing them to the game
 players.
       In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-39, the Group assesses whether it acts as the principal or as an agent in the arrangement with each party
 respectively. With respect to the jointly operated licensed arrangements between the Group and the third-party game developers, the Group considered it
 does not have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the game services. The Group’s responsibilities are distributing games,
 providing payment solution and market promotion service, and thus the Group views the third-party game developers to be its customers. Accordingly,
 the Group records the game distribution service revenue from these games, on a net basis based on the ratios pre-determined with the third-party game
 developers when the performance obligations are satisfied, which is generally when the paying players purchase virtual currencies issued by the third-
 party game developers.

                                                                          F-33

 v)    Revenue recognition (continued)

       Valued added services (“VAS”)
       The Group offers premium membership subscription, live broadcasting, comic and other paid contents to the customers.

       The Group offers premium membership services which provide subscribing members access to streaming of premium content in exchange for a
 non-refundable upfront premium membership fee. When the receipt of premium membership fees is for services to be delivered over a period of time,
 generally from one month to twelve months, the receipt is initially recorded as “Deferred revenue” and revenue is recognized ratably over the
 membership period as services are rendered.

        The Group operates and maintains live broadcasting channel whereby users can enjoy live performances provided by the hosts and interact with
 the hosts. Most of the hosts host the performance on their own. The Group creates and sells virtual items to users so that the users present them
 simultaneously to hosts to show their support. The virtual items sold by the Group comprise of either (i) consumable items or (ii) time-based items, such
 as privilege titles etc. Revenues derived from the sale of virtual items are recorded on a gross basis as the Group acts as the principal to fulfill all
 obligations related to the sale of virtual items in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-39. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at point-in-time when the
 virtual item is delivered and consumed if the virtual item is a consumable item or, in the case of time-based virtual item, recognized ratably over the
 period each virtual item is made available to the user, which generally does not exceed one year. Proceeds received from the sales of virtual items before
 they consumed are recorded as “Deferred revenue”.

       Under the arrangements with the hosts, the Group shares with them a portion of the revenues derived from the sales of virtual items. The portion
 paid to hosts is recognized as “Cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.


       Advertising services
        The Group provides various advertising formats, mainly include but not limited to advertisements appearing on the app opening page, banner text-
 links, logos, buttons and rich media, performance-based advertising and native advertisements which are customized according to advertisers’ needs.
 The Group determines each format of advertisements which is a distinct performance obligation. Consideration is allocated to each performance
 obligation based on its standalone selling price. The Group recognizes revenue on a pro-rata basis for each performance obligation, commencing on the
 date the advertisements are displayed on the Group’s platform or upon the performance obligations are satisfied, generally when users click on links.


       Sales incentives to customers
       The Group provides various sales incentives to its customers, including cash incentives in the form of commissions to certain third-party
 advertising agencies and noncash incentives such as discounts and advertising services provided free of charge in certain bundled arrangements, which
 are negotiated on a contract by contract basis with customers. The Group accounts for these incentives granted to customers as variable consideration in
 accordance with ASC 606. The amount of variable consideration is measured based on the most likely amount of incentive to be provided to customers.

                                                                           F-34

 v)    Revenue recognition (continued)

       E-commerce and other revenues
        E-commerce and other revenues are mainly from the sales of products through the Group’s e-commerce platform, as well as revenues from
 holding certain offline performance activities. E-commerce and other revenues are recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred
 to the customers, which generally occurs upon the acceptance of the goods or services by the customers. Pursuant to ASC 606-10-55-39, for
 arrangements where the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, are subject to inventory risk, and have
 latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, revenues are recorded on a gross basis. Otherwise, revenues are recorded on a net basis. Cash
 coupons, granted to the customers for free at the Group’s discretion, are recorded as a reduction of the arrangement’s transaction price thereby reducing
 the amount of revenue recognized as the payment is not for a distinct good or service received from the customer in accordance with ASC
 606-10-32-25.

       Net revenues presented on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss are net of sales discount and sales tax.


       Other Estimates and Judgments
       The Group estimates revenue of mobile game, VAS from the third-party payment processors in the current period when reasonable estimates of
 these amounts can be made. The processors provide reliable interim preliminary reporting within a reasonable time frame following the end of each
 month and the Group maintains records of sales data, both of which allow the Group to make reasonable estimates of revenue and therefore to recognize
 revenue during the reporting period. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that the Group
 believes are reasonable, but actual results may differ from the Group’s estimates. When the Group receives the final reports, to the extent not received
 within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month, the Group records any differences between estimated revenue and actual revenue in the
 reporting period when the Group determines the actual amounts. The revenue on the final revenue report have not differed significantly from the
 reported revenue for the periods presented.


       Contract balances
      Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Accounts receivable represent amounts invoiced, and
 revenue recognized prior to invoicing when the Group has satisfied its performance obligations and has the unconditional right to consideration.

       Deferred revenue relates to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and consists of cash payment received in
 advance from game players in mobile games, from customers in advertising services, live broadcasting services and other VAS, and e-commerce
 platforms. Due to the generally short-term duration of the relevant contracts, the majority of the performance obligations are satisfied within one year.
 The amount of revenue recognized that was included in the receipts in advance balance at the beginning of the year was RMB943.4 million,
 RMB1,238.8 million and RMB1,993.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

                                                                            F-35

       Practical expedients
       The Group has used the following practical expedients as allowed under ASC 606:

        The transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, has not been disclosed, as substantially
 all of the contracts have an original expected duration of one year or less.

       The Group expenses the costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less.

       The following table presents the Group’s net revenues disaggregated by revenue sources:

 w)    Cost of revenues
        Costs of revenues consist primarily of revenue sharing costs to mobile games developers and distribution channels and payment channels, revenue
 sharing with the hosts and content creators, staff costs, content costs, server and bandwidth service costs, depreciation expenses and other direct costs of
 providing these services as well as cost of merchandise sold. These costs are charged to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
 loss as incurred.


 x)    Related parties
        Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence
 over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or
 significant influence, such as a family member or relative, shareholder, or a related corporation.

                                                                                F-37

 y)    Net loss per share
        Loss per share is computed in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. The two-class method is used for computing earnings per share in
 the event the Group has net income available for distribution. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and
 participating securities based on dividends declared (or accumulated) and participating rights in undistributed earnings as if all the earnings for the
 reporting period had been distributed.

       Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
 share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares and potential ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Potential ordinary
 shares include ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share options using the treasury stock method and ordinary shares issuable upon
 the conversion of the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes using the if-converted method. The computation of diluted net loss per
 share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. an increase in earnings per
 share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts) on net loss per share. Net loss per ordinary share is computed on Class Y Ordinary Shares and
 Class Z Ordinary Shares combined basis, because both classes have the same dividend rights in the Company’s undistributed net income.


 z)    Statutory reserves
         In accordance with China’s Company Laws, the Company’s VIEs in PRC must make appropriations from their after-tax profit, as determined
 under the accounting principles generally acceptable in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC GAAP”), to non-distributable reserve funds including
 (i) statutory surplus fund and (ii) discretionary surplus fund. The appropriation to the statutory surplus fund must be at least 10% of the after-tax profits
 calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP. Appropriation is not required if the statutory surplus fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of the
 respective company. Appropriation to the discretionary surplus fund is made at the discretion of the respective company.

        Pursuant to the laws applicable to China’s FIEs, the Company’s subsidiaries that are FIEs in China have to make appropriations from their
 after-tax profit (as determined under PRC GAAP) to reserve funds including (i) general reserve fund, (ii) enterprise expansion fund and (iii) staff bonus
 and welfare fund. The appropriation to the general reserve fund must be at least 10% of the after-tax profits calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP.
 Appropriation is not required if the general reserve fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of the respective company. Appropriations to the other
 two reserve funds are at the respective companies’ discretion.

       The following table presents the Group’s appropriations to general reserve funds and statutory surplus funds for the years ended December 31,
 2019, 2020 and 2021:

 2.    Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 aa)   Noncontrolling interests
       For the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs, noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of the equity
 which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company as the controlling shareholder. Noncontrolling interests acquired through a business
 combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date, which is estimated with reference to the purchase price per share as of the acquisition
 date.

       The noncontrolling interests will continue to be attributed with its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest
 balance.


 bb) Comprehensive loss
       Comprehensive loss is defined to include all changes in equity of the Group during a period arising from transactions and other events and
 circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by shareholders and distributions to shareholders. Accumulated other comprehensive
 income/(loss), as presented on the consolidated balance sheets, consists of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments.


 cc)   Segment reporting
        Based on the criteria established by ASC 280, Segment Reporting, the Group’s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chairman
 of the Board of Directors and CEO, who reviews consolidated results of the Group when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing
 performance. The Group has internal reporting of revenue, cost and expenses by nature as a whole. Hence, the Group has only one operating segment.
 The Company is domiciled in the Cayman Islands while the Group mainly operates its businesses in the PRC and earns majority of the revenues from
 external customers attributed to the PRC.


 dd) Business combinations
        The Group accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business
 Combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities incurred
 by the Group to the sellers and equity instruments issued. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable
 assets and liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any
 noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any
 previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of
 acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statements of
 operations and comprehensive loss. During the measurement period, which can be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Group may record
 adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or
 final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded on the
 consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

        In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group re-measures the previously held equity interests in the acquiree when obtaining control at
 its acquisition date fair value and the re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
 loss.

                                                                               F-39

 dd) Business combinations (Continued)

       For the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs, noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of their
 equity which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company.

        If a business combination is under common control, the acquired assets and liabilities are recognized at their historical book value. The
 consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquired entities from the earliest date presented or, if more recent, from the date when the
 entities first came under common control, regardless of the date of the combination. Consolidated financial statements for prior years would also be
 retrospectively adjusted for periods during which the entities were under common control.


 ee)   Recently issued accounting pronouncements
       On January 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and
 Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)—Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
 Own Equity using the modified retrospective method. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments with characteristics of liabilities
 and equity by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. The adoption of this new standard has no impact on
 the consolidated financial statements.

       Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic
 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, Earnings
 Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and
 Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) to clarify and reduce diversity in an issuer’s accounting for
 modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification
 or exchange. The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal
 years. The Group does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

        Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08). In
 October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from
 Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract
 liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (Topic 606). The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal
 years. The Group does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

                                                                             F-40

 3.    Concentrations and Risks
 a)    Telecommunications service provider
       The Group relied on telecommunications service providers and their affiliates for servers and bandwidth services to support its operations for the
 years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 as follows:

                                                                                                                       For the Year Ended
                                                                                                                         December 31,
                                                                                                                  2019        2020        2021

             Total number of telecommunications service providers                                                 107          116           126

 b)    Foreign currency exchange rate risk
       The functional currency and the reporting currency of the Company are U.S. dollars and RMB, respectively. The Group’s exposure to foreign
 currency exchange rate risk primarily relates to cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, short-term and long-term investments, long-term debt and
 accounts payable denominated in the U.S. dollars. Most of the Group’s revenues, costs and expenses are denominated in RMB, while the long-term debt
 and a portion of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, short-term and long-term investments, and accounts payable are denominated in U.S. dollars.
 Any significant fluctuation of RMB against U.S. dollars may materially and adversely affect the Company’s cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial
 positions.


 c)    Credit risk
       The Group’s financial instruments potentially subject to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents,
 time deposits, accounts receivable, and money market funds and financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying
 assets issued by commercial banks and other financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, substantially all of the Group’s cash and cash
 equivalents and time deposits were held in major financial institutions located in the United States of America and China, which management consider
 being of high credit quality. Accounts receivable is typically unsecured and is primarily derived from revenue earned from mobile game services
 (mainly relates to remittances due from payment channels and distribution channels) and advertising services. There was no individual payment channel
 that had receivable balance exceeding 10% of the Group’s accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. One distribution channel had
 receivable balance exceeding 10% of the Group’s accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, as follows:

 * App stores retain commissions on each purchase made by the users through the App stores. The Group is also obligated to pay ongoing licensing fees
   in form of royalties to the third-party game developers. Licensing fees consist of fees that the Group pays to content owners for the use of licensed
   content, including trademarks and copyrights, in the development of games. Licensing fees are either paid in advance and recorded on the balance
   sheets as prepayments or accrued as incurred and subsequently paid. Additionally, the Group defers the revenue from licensed mobile games over the
   estimated average playing period of paying players given that there is an implied obligation to provide on-going services to end-users. The related
   direct and incremental platform commissions as well as game developers’ licensing fees are deferred and reported in “Prepayments and Other
   Current Assets” on the consolidated balance sheets.

 9.    Long-term Investments, Net
      The Group’s long-term investments primarily consist of equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative, equity investments
 accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at fair value.

                                                                                                                  December 31,    December 31,

       Equity investments using the measurement alternative
       The Group did not disclose the fair value of alternative measure method investments if it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of its
 alternative measure method investments for which a quoted market price is not available due to both excessive cost as well as lack of available
 information on fair value of such investments. Specifically, many of the investees are start-up companies in China and operate in emerging industries for
 which the Group has not been able to estimate their fair values. For those equity investments having observable price changes in orderly transactions for
 the identical or similar investments of the same issuers, the Group would disclose the fair value of the alternative measure method investments.

       Nil, nil and RMB31.5 million re-measurement loss of equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative was recognized for the
 years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

       The Group recorded impairment charges for long-term investments of RMB5.9 million, RMB8.0 million and RMB91.5 million as “Investment
 income/(loss), net (including impairments)” for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, as the Group determined the fair value
 of these investments was less than their carrying value.

       Equity investments accounted for using the equity method
       RMB24.2 million, RMB50.5 million and RMB37.2 million of the Group’s proportionate share of equity investee’s net loss, was recognized in
 “Investment income/(loss), net (including impairments)” for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

       Investments accounted for at fair value
       Investments accounted for at fair value primarily include financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying
 assets and with original maturities great than one year and investments in publicly traded companies with an intention of holding greater than one year.
 A gain of RMB13.2 million, RMB24.9 million and a loss of RMB156.0 million resulted from the change in fair value was recognized in “Investment
 income/(loss), net (including impairments)” for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

                                                                           F-45

 a)    Income taxes
       Cayman Islands
       Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company and its intermediate holding companies in the Cayman Islands are not subject to tax
 on income or capital gain. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by the Company or its subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands to their shareholders, no
 withholding tax will be imposed.


       British Virgin Islands (“BVI”)
       Subsidiaries in the BVI are exempted from income tax on their foreign-derived income in the BVI. There are no withholding taxes in the BVI.


       Hong Kong
       Subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to 16.5% income tax on their taxable income generated from operations in Hong Kong. The payments of
 dividends by these companies to their shareholders are not subject to any withholding tax in Hong Kong. Commencing from the year of assessment of
 2019, 2020 and 2021, the first HK$2 million of profits earned by the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong will be taxed at half the
 current tax rate (i.e. 8.25%) while the remaining profits will continue to be taxed at the existing 16.5% tax rate.


       China
      On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of the PRC enacted the Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) Law, under which FIEs and domestic
 companies would be subject to EIT at a uniform rate of 25%. Preferential tax treatments will continue to be granted to FIEs or domestic companies
 which conduct businesses in certain encouraged sectors and to entities otherwise classified as “Software Enterprises”, “Key Software Enterprises”,
 “Encouraged Enterprises” and/or “High and New Technology Enterprises” (“HNTEs”). The EIT Law became effective on January 1, 2008.

       The aforementioned preferential tax rates are subject to annual review by the relevant tax authorities in China. Certain subsidiaries were qualified
 as HNTEs or Encouraged Enterprises and enjoyed a preferential income tax rate at 15% for the corresponding years from the year they are qualified,
 respectively, provided that they continue to qualify as HNTEs or Encouraged Enterprises during such periods.

        Realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and adequate
 future taxable income, exclusive of reversing deductible temporary differences and tax loss or credit carry forwards. The Group evaluates the potential
 realization of deferred tax assets on an entity-by-entity basis. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, valuation allowances were provided against deferred
 tax assets in entities where it was determined it was more-likely-than-not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

        The following table sets forth the movement of the aggregate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for the periods presented:

 10.   Taxation (Continued)

 d)    Withholding income tax on dividends
         The EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a FIE to its immediate holding company outside of
 China, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the received
 dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China, unless such immediate holding
 company’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. The Cayman Islands, where
 the Company was incorporated, does not have such tax treaty with China. According to the arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong
 Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion in August 2006, dividends paid by a FIE in China
 to its immediate holding company in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate that may be lowered to 5% (if the foreign investor owns
 directly at least 25% of the shares of the FIE). The State Administration of Taxation further promulgated Circular 601 on October 27, 2009, which
 provides that tax treaty benefits will be denied to “conduit” or shell companies without business substance and that a beneficial ownership analysis will
 be used based on a “substance-over-form” principle to determine whether or not to grant the tax treaty benefits.

       To the extent that subsidiaries and VIEs of the Group have undistributed earnings, the Group will accrue appropriate expected withholding tax
 associated with repatriation of such undistributed earnings. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Group did not record any withholding tax on the
 retained earnings of its subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC as most of which were still in accumulated deficit position.

       The issuance costs of the 2027 Notes were amortized to interest expense over the contractual life to the maturity date (i.e., June 15, 2027). For the
 year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the 2027 Notes related interest expense was US$6.9 million (RMB46.8 million) and US$11.9 million
 (RMB76.8 million), respectively.


       December 2026 Notes
       In November 2021, the Group issued US$1,600 million of December 2026 Notes with an interest rate of 0.50% per annum. The net proceeds to
 the Company from the issuance of the December 2026 Notes were US$1,576.6 million (RMB10.1 billion), net of issuance costs of US$23.4 million
 (RMB149.6 million). The December 2026 Notes may be converted, at an initial conversion rate of 10.6419 ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount
 (which represents an initial conversion price of US$93.97 per ADS) at each holder’s option at any time prior to the close of business on the second
 business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2026. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be,
 cash, ADSs or a combination of cash and ADSs, at the Company’s election. Holders of the Notes may elect to receive Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of
 any ADSs deliverable upon conversion.

       Holders of the December 2026 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their December 2026 Notes in cash on December 1,
 2024, or in the event of certain fundamental changes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

      The issuance costs of the December 2026 Notes were amortized to interest expense over the contractual life to the maturity date (i.e., December 1,
 2026). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the December 2026 Notes related interest expense was US$1.4 million (RMB8.7 million).

       The Company accounted for the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes as single instruments as “Long-term debt” measured at
 its amortized cost, as none of the embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and
 December 2026 Notes were not issued with a substantial premium. The issuance costs were recorded as an adjustment to the long-term debt and are
 amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method.

                                                                            F-51

 16.   Employee Benefits

       The Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs incorporated in China participate in a government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan
 under which certain retirement, medical, housing and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require the Company’s
 Chinese subsidiaries and VIEs to pay to the local labor bureau a monthly contribution at a stated contribution rate based on the monthly basic
 compensation of qualified employees. The relevant local labor bureau is responsible for meeting all retirement benefit obligations; hence, the Group has
 no further commitments beyond its monthly contribution. The following table presents the Group’s employee welfare benefits expenses for the years
 ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021:

                                                                                                               For the Year Ended December 31,

 17.   Share-based Compensation

 a)    Description of share option plans

       In July 2014, the Group adopted its Global Share Incentive Plan (the “Global Share Plan”), which permits the grant of options, restricted shares
 and restricted share units of the Company to relevant directors, officers, other employees and consultants of the Group. The maximum aggregate number
 of Class Z Ordinary Shares, which may be issued pursuant to all awards under the Global Share Plan, is 19,880,315 shares.

      In February 2018, the Group adopted its 2018 Share Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) to provide additional incentives to employees, directors and
 consultants and promote the success of our business. The maximum aggregate number of Class Z Ordinary Shares, which may be issued pursuant to all
 awards under the 2018 Plan as at December 31, 2021, is 23,367,875 shares.

        Option awards are granted with an exercise price determined by the Board of Directors. Those option awards generally vest over a period of two
 to six years and expire in six to seven years.

      As of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation expenses related to unvested awards granted under the Global Share Plan and the
 2018 Plan, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, was RMB 4,497.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.2 years
 and may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

 b)    Valuation assumptions

        The Group uses binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share options. The estimated fair value of each share option granted
 is estimated on the date of grant using the binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

                                                                                                      For the Year Ended December 31,

 17.   Share-based Compensation (Continued)
 (b)   Valuation assumptions (continued)

        The expected volatility at each grant date was estimated based on the annualized standard deviation of the daily return embedded in historical
 share prices of comparable peer companies with a time horizon close to the expected expiry of the term of the share options. The weighted average
 volatility is the expected volatility at the grant date weighted by the number of the share options. The Company has never declared or paid any cash
 dividends on its capital stock, and the Company does not anticipate any dividend payments in the foreseeable future. Contractual term is the remaining
 contract life of the share options. The Group estimated the risk-free interest rate based on the yield to maturity of U.S. treasury bonds denominated in
 US dollars at the share option grant date.

       The following table presents a summary of the Group’s share options activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021:

 19.   Commitments and Contingencies
 (a)   Commitments
       Purchase obligations
       In September 2020, the Group signed a contract to purchase the three-year license for live broadcasting the League of Legends World
 Championship starting from 2020 at an aggregate purchase price of RMB800.0 million (US$125.5 million). The unpaid purchase price was RMB315.0
 million (US$49.4 million) as of December 31, 2021.


       Long-term debt obligations
       The Group’s long-term debt obligations are to repay the principal amount and cash interests in connection with the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes
 and December 2026 Notes. The expected repayment schedules of the April 2026 Notes,2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes has been disclosed in
 Note 14.


 (b)   Litigation
       From time to time, the Group is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently
 available information, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, is
 reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

        However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and the Group’s view of these matters may change in the future. The Group records a
 liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Group reviews the need
 for any such liability on a regular basis. The Group has not recorded material liabilities in this regard as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.

                                                                               F-56

 1.    In June 2019, to focus the Company’s efforts and resources on its core businesses, the Company transferred several equity investments of the
       Group to an investment fund. The Group contributed a total of RMB220.0 million cash into this fund as a limited partner, which is accounted for
       as an equity method investment. The cost of the equity investments transferred was RMB465.8 million. The consideration was RMB539.6 million,
       which was based on the estimated fair value of the investments. The difference between the consideration and cost of the investments was
       recognized as investment income. In July 2020, the Company acquired certain equity interests of two investments from the investment fund. The
       consideration was RMB110.0 million. The balances due from an investment fund as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were consideration
       receivables and dividend receivables, which are non-trade in nature.
 2.    In September 2020, the Company acquired the rest equity interests of Chaodian from certain noncontrolling shareholders, which included some
       related parties of the Company. The consideration was determined by referenced to a third-party valuer’s valuation and the considerations were
       settled in 2020.
 3.    The Company established the Entity with an independent third party and two entities controlled by Mr. Rui Chen and Ms. Ni Li, respectively, to
       acquire the land use rights for a parcel of land in Shanghai for future construction. The Company made capital contribution of RMB1,084.3
       million and provided interest-bearing guaranteed loans of RMB 1,701.0 million to the Entity for its operation. The balance as of December 31,
       2021 represents interest-bearing loans and interest expenses related to the Entity, which are non-trade in nature. The annual interest rates of the
       loans were 3.3%.
 4.    The balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 mainly represent interest-bearing loans and interest expenses of RMB105.6 and RMB279.2
       million related to an equity investee, which are non-trade in nature. Interest rates of loans to the investee incurred in 2020 and 2021 were 2.8% and
       4.5%, respectively.
 5.    Amount due to related parties as of December 31, 2021 are primarily considerations related to long-term investments, which are non-trade in
       nature.

                                                                            F-57

 21.   Segment Information
       Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
 by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The
 Group’s CODM is Mr. Rui Chen, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.

       The Group’s organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the CODM uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations which
 include, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products and technology. The Group’s operating segments are based on such organizational
 structure and information reviewed by the Group’s CODM to evaluate the operating segment results. The Group has internal reporting of revenue, cost
 and expenses by nature as a whole. Hence, the Group has only one operating segment.
       Substantially the majority of the Group’s revenues are derived from China based on the geographical locations where services are provided to
customers. In addition, the Group’s long-lived assets are substantially all located in and derived from China, and the amount of long-lived assets
attributable to any individual other country is not material. Therefore, no geographical segments are presented.


22.   Fair Value Measurement
      When available, the Group uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of an asset or liability. If quoted market prices are not available,
the Group will measure fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters,
such as interest rates and currency rates. The Group measures investments in money market funds, financial products and equity investments in publicly
traded companies at fair value.
       Money market funds and equity investments in publicly traded companies. The Group values its money market funds and equity investments in
publicly traded companies using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for securities with identical characteristics, and accordingly, the Group
classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as Level 1.
      Financial products. The Group values its financial products investments held in certain banks or other financial institutions using quoted prices for
securities with similar characteristics and other observable inputs, and accordingly, the Group classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as
Level 2.
      Accounts receivable, amounts due from/to related parties and other current assets are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair
value due to their short-term nature. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other payables are financial liabilities with carrying values that
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
      The Group measures equity investments accounted for using the equity method at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment charge
were to be recognized. Equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are generally not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.
However, if equity investments without readily determinable fair values were re-measured during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, they
were classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Group estimated the value of the instruments based on valuation methods using the
observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs.


23.   Restricted Net Assets
       Relevant PRC laws and regulations permit the PRC companies to pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in
accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, the Company’s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs can only distribute dividends upon
approval of the shareholders after they have met the PRC requirements for appropriation to the generically reserve fund and the statutory surplus fund
respectively. The general reserve fund and the statutory surplus fund require that annual appropriations of 10% of net after-tax income should be set
aside prior to payment of any dividends. As a result of these and other restrictions under the PRC laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries and VIEs
are restricted in their abilities to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans or advances, which restricted
portion amounted to approximately RMB3.8 billion or 17.3% of the Company’s total consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore,
cash transfers from the Company’s PRC subsidiaries to their parent companies outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency
conversion. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to remit
sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to the Company, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations.
Even though the Company currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from the PRC subsidiaries and VIEs for working capital and
other funding purposes, the Company may in the future require additional cash resources from its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs due to changes in business
conditions, to fund future acquisitions and developments, or merely declare and pay dividends to or distributions to the Company’s shareholders.

      (b) The Person in whose name any Note (or its Predecessor Note) is registered on the Note Register at the close of business on any Regular
Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date. Interest shall be
payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained by the Company for such purposes in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York,
which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office. The Company shall pay or cause the Paying Agent to pay interest (i) on any Physical Notes to each
Holder holding Physical Notes by wire transfer in immediately available funds to that Holder’s account within the United States, which application shall
remain in effect until the Holder notifies, in writing, the Note Registrar to the contrary or (ii) on any Global Note by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee.

                                                                           16
       (c) Any Defaulted Amounts shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant payment date but shall accrue interest per annum at
the rate per annum borne by the Notes plus one percent, subject to the enforceability thereof under applicable law, from, and including, such relevant
payment date, and such Defaulted Amounts together with such interest thereon shall be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in
clause (i) or (ii) below:
            (i) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Amounts to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective
      Predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Amounts, which shall be
      fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of the Defaulted Amounts proposed to be paid on
      each Note and the date of the proposed payment (which shall be not less than 25 days after the receipt by the Trustee of such notice, unless the
      Trustee in its sole discretion shall consent to an earlier date), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money
      equal to the aggregate amount to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Amounts or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such
      deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to
      such Defaulted Amounts as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Company shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted
      Amounts which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment, and not less than 10 days after
      the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of such special record
      date and the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Amounts and
      the special record date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid (at the Company’s expense), to each Holder at its address as it appears in
      the Note Register, not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Amounts and the
      special record date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Amounts shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their
      respective Predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on such special record date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the
      following clause (ii) of this Section 2.03(c).
            (ii) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Amounts in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of
      any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Notes may be listed or designated for issuance, and upon such notice as may
      be required by such exchange or automated quotation system, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment
      pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

                                                                            17
       Section 2.04 Execution, Authentication and Delivery of Notes. The Notes shall be signed in the name and on behalf of the Company by the
manual or facsimile signature of its Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary or any of its Executive or Senior
Vice Presidents. With the delivery of this Indenture, the Company is furnishing, and from time to time thereafter may furnish, a certificate substantially
in the form of Exhibit B (an “Authorization Certificate”) identifying and certifying the incumbency and specimen (and/or facsimile) signatures of its
active authorized Officers. Until the Trustee receives a subsequent Authorization Certificate, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the last
Authorization Certificate delivered to it for purposes of determining the relevant authorized Officers. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in
any signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Note which has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.

      At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Notes executed by the Company to
the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Notes, and the Trustee in accordance with
such Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Notes, without any further action by the Company hereunder.

       The Company Order shall specify the amount of Notes to be authenticated, the applicable rate at which interest will accrue on such Notes, the date
on which the original issuance of such Notes is to be authenticated, the date from which interest will begin to accrue, the date or dates on which interest
on such Notes will be payable and the date on which the principal of such Notes will be payable and other terms relating to such Notes. The Trustee
shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Notes to or upon the written order of the Company (as set forth in such Company Order).

       The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Notes under this Section (a) unless and until it receives from the
Company a Company Order instructing it to so authenticate and deliver such Notes and, if requested by the Trustee, an Officers’ Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel in accordance with Section 17.06 hereof; (b) if the Trustee determines that such action may not lawfully be taken; or (c) if the
Trustee determines that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability, unless indemnity and/or security and/or pre-funding reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee against such liability is provided to the Trustee and the Note Registrar.

      Only such Notes as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth on the form of Note attached as Exhibit A
hereto, executed manually or electronically by an authorized officer of the Trustee, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or
obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Note executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Note so
authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

      In case any Officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Notes shall cease to be such Officer before the Notes so signed shall have
been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Notes nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or
disposed of as though the Person who signed such Notes had not ceased to be such Officer of the Company; and any Note may be signed on behalf of
the Company by such Persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Note, shall be the Officers of the Company, although at the date of the
execution of this Indenture any such Person was not such an Officer.

                                                                             18
       Section 2.05 Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Notes; Restrictions on Transfer; Depositary. (a) The Company shall cause to be kept at
the Corporate Trust Office a register (the register maintained in such office or in any other office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to
Section 4.02, the “Note Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration
of Notes and of transfers of Notes. Such register shall be in written form or in any form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable
period of time. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is hereby initially appointed the “Note Registrar” and “Transfer Agent” for the purpose of
registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein provided. The Company may appoint one or more co-Note Registrars in accordance with Section 4.02.

      Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note to the Note Registrar or any co-Note Registrar, and satisfaction of the requirements for
such transfer set forth in this Section 2.05, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated
transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes of any authorized denominations, and of a like aggregate principal amount and bearing such restrictive
legends as may be required by (c).

       Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Notes
to be exchanged at any such office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 4.02. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Notes that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to
receive, bearing registration numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.

       All Notes presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange, repurchase or conversion shall (if so required by the Company, the
Trustee, the Note Registrar or any co-Note Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its attorney-in-fact duly authorized in writing.

      No service charge shall be imposed by the Company, the Transfer Agent, the Note Registrar, any co-Note Registrar or the Paying Agent for any
exchange or registration of transfer of Notes, but the Company may require a Holder to pay a sum sufficient to cover any documentary, stamp, issue,
transfer or similar tax required in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of new Notes issued upon such exchange or registration of
transfer being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer. The Company shall pay the
ADS Depositary’s fees for issuance of the ADSs.

       None of the Company, the Trustee, the Note Registrar or any co-Note Registrar shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of (i) any Notes
surrendered for conversion or, if a portion of any Note is surrendered for conversion, such portion thereof surrendered for conversion, (ii) any Notes, or
a portion of any Note, surrendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn) in accordance with Article 15 or (iii) any Notes selected for redemption in
accordance with Article 16.

                                                                            19
     All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes in accordance with this Indenture shall be the valid obligations of the
Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

       The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to any direct or indirect participant or any other Person with respect to the accuracy of the
books or records, or the acts or omissions, of the Depositary or its nominee or of any participant or member thereof, with respect to any ownership
interest in the Notes or with respect to the delivery to any direct or indirect participant or other Person (other than the Depositary and any other
registered Holder of Notes) of any notice (including any Redemption Notice pursuant to Article 16) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect
to such Notes. All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to Holders under the Notes shall be given or
made only to or upon the order of the registered Holders (which shall be the Depositary or its nominee in the case of a Global Note). The rights of
beneficial owners in any Global Note shall be exercised only through the Depositary subject to the customary procedures of the Depositary. The Trustee
may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depositary with respect to its direct or indirect participants.

       The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this
Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or among direct or indirect
participants in any Global Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly
required by, the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.

      (b) So long as the Notes are eligible for book-entry settlement with the Depositary, unless otherwise required by law, subject to the fourth
paragraph from the end of Section 2.05(c) all Notes shall be represented by one or more Notes in global form (each, a “Global Note”) registered in the
name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary. The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in a Global Note that does not involve the
issuance of a Physical Note shall be effected through the Depositary in accordance with this Indenture (including the restrictions on transfer set forth
herein) and the procedures of the Depositary therefor.

       (c) Every Note that bears or is required under this Section 2.05(c) to bear the legend set forth in this Section 2.05(c) (together with any ADSs
(including the Ordinary Shares represented thereby) delivered upon conversion of the Notes that are required to bear the legend set forth in
Section 2.05(d) and the Ordinary Shares deliverable in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion of the Notes that are required to be subject to
certain transfer restrictions set forth in Section 2.05(d), collectively, the “Restricted Securities”) shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth
in this Section 2.05(c) (including the legend set forth below), unless such restrictions on transfer shall be eliminated or otherwise waived by written
consent of the Company, and the Holder of each such Restricted Security, by such Holder’s acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by all such
restrictions on transfer. As used in this Section 2.05(c) and Section 2.05(d), the term “transfer” encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer or other
disposition whatsoever of any Restricted Security.

                                                                                20
       Until the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is the later of (1) the date that is one year after the last date of original issuance
of the Notes, or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor provision thereto, and (2) such later date,
if any, as may be required by applicable law, any certificate evidencing such Note (and all securities issued in exchange therefor or substitution thereof,
other than ADSs (including the Ordinary Shares represented thereby or deliverable in lieu thereof) issued upon conversion thereof, which shall bear the
legend or be subject to certain transfer restrictions, in each case set forth in Section 2.05(d), if applicable) shall bear a legend in substantially the
following form (unless such Notes have been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has become or been declared effective under the
Securities Act and that continues to be effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under
the Securities Act or any similar provision then in force under the Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing, with notice
thereof to the Trustee):

                    REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

    PRIOR TO THE REGISTRATION OF ANY TRANSFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH (2)(D) ABOVE, THE COMPANY, THE DEPOSITARY
AND THE TRUSTEE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF SUCH LEGAL OPINIONS, CERTIFICATIONS OR OTHER
EVIDENCE AS MAY REASONABLY BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN

PRECEDING MONTHS MAY PURCHASE, OTHERWISE ACQUIRE OR OWN THIS NOTE, THE AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES
DELIVERABLE UPON CONVERSION HEREOF AND THE CLASS Z ORDINARY SHARES REPRESENTED THEREBY, OR A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST HEREIN OR THEREIN.

     No transfer of any Note prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date will be registered by the Note Registrar unless the applicable box on the
Form of Assignment and Transfer has been checked.

       Any Note (or security issued in exchange or substitution therefor) as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with
their terms may, upon surrender of such Note for exchange to the Note Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.05, be exchanged
for a new Note or Notes, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the restrictive legend required by this Section 2.05(c) and
shall not be assigned a restricted CUSIP number. The Company shall be entitled to instruct the Trustee in writing to so surrender any Global Note as to
which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms for exchange, and, upon such instruction, the Trustee shall so
surrender such Global Note for exchange; and any new Global Note so exchanged therefor shall not bear the restrictive legend specified in this
Section 2.05(c) and shall not be assigned a restricted CUSIP number. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing upon the occurrence of
the Resale Restriction Termination Date and after a registration statement, if any, with respect to the Notes or the ADSs (including the Ordinary Shares

                                                                            22
       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in this Section 2.05(c)), a Global Note may not be
transferred as a whole or in part except (i) by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or
another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary and
(ii) for transfers of portions of a Global Note in certificated form made upon request of a member of, or a participant in, the Depositary (for itself or on
behalf of a beneficial owner) by written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures of the
Depositary and in compliance with this Section 2.05(c).

       The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act. The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company to
act as Depositary with respect to each Global Note. Initially, each Global Note shall be issued to the Depositary, registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
as the nominee of the Depositary, and deposited with the Trustee as custodian for Cede & Co.

      If (i) the Depositary notifies the Company at any time that the Depositary is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and
a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days, (ii) the Depositary ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a
successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days or (iii) an Event of Default with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing and a beneficial
owner of any Note requests that its beneficial interest therein be issued as a Physical Note, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of
an Officers’ Certificate and a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Notes, shall authenticate and deliver (x) in the case of clause (iii), a
Physical Note to such beneficial owner in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Note corresponding to such beneficial owner’s
beneficial interest and (y) in the case of clause (i) or (ii), Physical Notes to each beneficial owner of the related Global Notes (or a portion thereof) in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Global Notes in exchange for such Global Notes, and upon delivery of the
Global Notes to the Note Registrar such Global Notes shall be canceled.

      Physical Notes issued in exchange for all or a part of the Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) shall be registered in such names and in such
authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Note Registrar
in writing. Upon execution and authentication, the Note Registrar shall deliver such Physical Notes to the Persons in whose names such Physical Notes
are so registered.

                                                                              23
       At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been converted, canceled, repurchased, redeemed or transferred, such Global Note shall be,
upon receipt thereof, canceled by the Note Registrar in accordance with standing procedures and existing instructions of the Depositary. At any time
prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for Physical Notes, converted, canceled, repurchased, redeemed or transferred to
a transferee who receives Physical Notes therefor or any Physical Note is exchanged or transferred for part of such Global Note, the principal amount of
such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and existing instructions of the Depositary, be appropriately reduced or increased, as
the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note, by the Note Registrar, to reflect such reduction or increase.

       None of the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any agent of the Company or any agent of the Trustee shall have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Note or maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

       (d) Until the Resale Restriction Termination Date, any certificate representing ADSs (including the Ordinary Shares represented thereby) issued
upon conversion of such Note shall bear a legend in substantially the following form, unless the Note or such ADSs (including the Ordinary Shares
represented thereby) has been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has become or been declared effective under the Securities Act and
that continues to be effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar provision
then in force under the Securities Act, or such ADS or the Ordinary Shares represented thereby have been issued upon conversion of Notes that have
been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has become or been declared effective under the Securities Act and that continues to be
effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar
provision then in force under the Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the Depositary with written notice thereof to the Note

                                                      25
       Pursuant to the terms of the the Unrestricted Deposit Agreement, the Restricted Deposit Agreement and the Procedures Letter, as applicable, the
ADS Depositary will not accept the surrender of any ADSs subject to such restrictions on transfer for the purpose of withdrawal of the Ordinary Shares
represented thereby prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. Any such ADSs as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in
accordance with their terms may, upon surrender of the certificates representing such ADSs for exchange in accordance with the procedures of the
transfer agent for the ADSs, the Restricted Deposit Agreement and the Procedures Letter, as applicable, be exchanged for a new certificate or certificates
for a like aggregate number of ADSs, which shall not bear the restrictive legend required by this Section 2.05(d).

       Until the Resale Restriction Termination Date, the Ordinary Shares deliverable in lieu of ADSs upon conversion shall be subject to the same
transfer restrictions as described in the legend in this Section 2.05(d) and as imposed by the Hong Kong share registrar, unless the Note or such Ordinary
Shares has been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has become or been declared effective under the Securities Act and that continues to
be effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar provision then in force under
the Securities Act, or such Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof have been issued upon conversion of Notes that have been transferred pursuant to a
registration statement that has become or been declared effective under the Securities Act and that continues to be effective at the time of such transfer,
or pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar provision then in force under the Securities
Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the Hong Kong Share Registrar with written notice thereof to the Note Registrar.

       (e) Any Note or ADS (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) delivered upon the conversion or exchange of any Note that is repurchased or owned
by any Affiliate of the Company may not be resold by such Affiliate (or a Holder that was the Company’s Affiliate at any time during three months
preceding the resale) unless registered under the Securities Act or resold pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act in a transaction that results in such Note or ADS (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof), as the case may be,
no longer being a “restricted security” (as defined under Rule 144 under the Securities Act). The Company shall cause any Note that is repurchased or
owned by it to be surrendered to the Note Registrar for cancellation in accordance with Section 2.08.

       Section 2.06 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes. In case any Note shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company
in its discretion may execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Note, bearing a registration
number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Note so
destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security and/or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such
substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.

                                                                            26
       The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Note and deliver the same upon the receipt of such security and/or indemnity as the Trustee and
the Company may require. No service charge shall be imposed by the Company, the Transfer Agent, the Note Registrar, any co-Note Registrar or the
Paying Agent upon the issuance of any substitute Note, but the Company may require a Holder to pay a sum sufficient to cover any documentary, stamp,
issue, transfer or similar tax required in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new substitute Note being different from the
name of the Holder of the old Note that became mutilated or was destroyed, lost or stolen. In case any Note that has matured or is about to mature or has
been surrendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn) in accordance with Article 15 or has been selected for redemption in accordance with Article 16 or
is about to be converted in accordance with Article 14 shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, in its sole discretion,
instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except
in the case of a mutilated Note), as the case may be, if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee
such security and/or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected
with such substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company, and the Trustee evidence of their
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.

       Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.06 by virtue of the fact that any Note is destroyed, lost or stolen shall
constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and shall be
entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, all Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions
are exclusive with respect to the replacement, payment, redemption, conversion or repurchase of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall
preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the
replacement, payment, redemption, conversion or repurchase of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.

      Section 2.07 Temporary Notes. Pending the preparation of Physical Notes, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a
Company Order, authenticate and deliver temporary Notes (printed or lithographed). Temporary Notes shall be issuable in any authorized denomination,
and substantially in the form of the Physical Notes but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Notes, all as
may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Note shall be executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee upon the same
conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the Physical Notes. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall
execute and deliver to the Trustee Physical Notes (other than any Global Note) and thereupon any or all temporary Notes (other than any Global Note)
may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 4.02 and the Trustee shall upon
receipt of a Company Order authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of Physical Notes. Such
exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall in all
respects be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same limitations under this Indenture as Physical Notes authenticated and delivered
hereunder.

                                                                             27
      Section 2.08 Cancellation of Notes Paid, Converted, Etc. The Company shall cause all Notes surrendered for the purpose of payment,
repurchase, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or conversion, if surrendered to any Person other than the Note Registrar (including any of
the Company’s agents, Subsidiaries, Consolidated Affiliated Entities or Affiliates), to be delivered and surrendered to the Note Registrar for
cancellation. All Notes delivered to the Note Registrar shall be canceled promptly by it, and no Notes shall be authenticated in exchange thereof except
as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Note Registrar shall dispose of canceled Notes in accordance with its customary
procedures and, after such disposition, shall deliver a certificate of such cancellation and disposition to the Company, at the Company’s written request
in a Company Order.

       Section 2.09 CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Notes may use “CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee
shall use “CUSIP” numbers in all notices issued to Holders as a convenience to such Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no
representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or on such notice and that reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the “CUSIP” numbers.

       Section 2.10 Additional Notes; Repurchases. The Company may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Holders and notwithstanding
Section 2.01, reopen this Indenture and issue additional Notes hereunder with the same terms as the Notes initially issued hereunder (except for any
differences in the issue price, the issue date and interest accrued, if any, and, if applicable, restrictions on transfer in respect of such additional Notes) in
an unlimited aggregate principal amount; provided that if any such additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes initially issued hereunder for U.S.
federal income tax or securities law purposes, such additional Notes shall have a separate CUSIP number from the Notes. Prior to the issuance of any
such additional Notes, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a Company Order, an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, such Officers’
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to cover such matters, in addition to those required by Section 17.06, as the Trustee shall reasonably request. In
addition, the Company may, to the extent permitted by law, and directly or indirectly (regardless of whether such Notes are surrendered to the
Company), repurchase Notes in the open market or otherwise, whether by the Company or through its Subsidiaries or Consolidated Affiliated Entities or
through a private or public tender or exchange offer or through counterparties to private agreements. The Company shall cause any Notes so repurchased
to be surrendered to the Note Registrar for cancellation in accordance with Section 2.08 and upon receipt of a Company Order, the Note Registrar shall
cancel all Notes so surrendered and such Notes shall no longer be considered outstanding under this Indenture upon their cancellation. The Company
may also enter into cash-settled swaps or other derivatives with respect to the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, any Notes underlying such cash-settled
swaps or other derivatives shall not be required to be surrendered to the Note Registrar for cancellation in accordance with Section 2.08 and will
continue to be considered outstanding for purposes of this Indenture, subject to the provisions of Section 8.04.

                                                                               28
                                                                  ARTICLE 3
                                                         SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

       Section 3.01 Satisfaction and Discharge. This Indenture shall upon request of the Company contained in an Officers’ Certificate cease to be of
further effect, and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture, when (a) (i) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (x) Notes which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have
been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.06 and (y) Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held
in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 4.04(d)) have been delivered to the
Note Registrar for cancellation; or (ii) the Company has deposited with the Paying Agent or delivered to Holders, as applicable, after the Notes have
become due and payable, whether on the Maturity Date, the Redemption Date, any Repurchase Date, any Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, upon
conversion or otherwise, cash, ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) or a combination thereof, as applicable, solely to satisfy the Company’s
Conversion Obligation, sufficient to pay all of the outstanding Notes and all other sums due and payable under this Indenture by the Company; and
(b) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein
provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.06 shall survive.


                                                                ARTICLE 4
                                                  PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

      Section 4.01 Payment of Principal and Interest. The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be paid the principal (including the
Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, each of
the Notes at the places, at the respective times and in the manner provided herein and in the Notes.

      Section 4.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or
agency (which will be the Corporate Trust Office initially) where the Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange or for
presentation for payment or repurchase (“Paying Agent”) or for conversion (“Conversion Agent”) and where notices and demands to or upon the
Company in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any
change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office,
provided, however, that the legal service of process against the Company shall in no circumstance be made at an office or agency of the Trustee.

                                                                           29
      The Company may also from time to time designate as co-Note Registrars one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be
presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided that no such designation or
rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency. The terms “Paying Agent” and “Conversion Agent” include any such additional or other offices or
agencies, as applicable.

     The Company hereby initially designates Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as the Paying Agent, Note Registrar, Transfer Agent and
Conversion Agent and the Corporate Trust Office and the office or agency of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, each shall be considered as one such office or agency of the Company for each of the aforesaid purposes.

     The Conversion Agent will open a non-interest bearing account in the name of the Company for the purpose of any cash payments to be made to
Holders in lieu of fractional shares of ADSs. The Conversion Agent’s wire instructions to receive cash from the Company are set forth herein in
Exhibit C.

      Section 4.03 Appointments to Fill Vacancies in Trustee’s Office. The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of
Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 7.09, a trustee, so that there shall at all times be a trustee hereunder.

      Section 4.04 Provisions as to Paying Agent. (a) If the Company shall appoint a Paying Agent other than the Trustee, the Company will cause
such Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this
Section 4.04:
            (i) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase
      Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes for the benefit of the Holders
      of the Notes;
           (ii) that it will give the Trustee prompt notice of any failure by the Company to make any payment of the principal (including the
      Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the
      Notes when the same shall be due and payable; and
           (iii) that at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, upon request of the Trustee, it will forthwith pay to the Trustee all
      sums so held.

       The Company shall, on or before each due date of the principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, or accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes, deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such
principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) or accrued and unpaid
interest and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action; provided that
such deposit must be received by the Paying Agent by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day prior to the relevant due date. The Paying
Agent shall not be bound to make any payment until it has received, in immediately available and cleared funds, an amount which shall be sufficient to
pay, as applicable, the aggregate amount of principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price, if applicable) of, or accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes when such principal or interest shall become due and payable. The Paying Agent
shall not be responsible or liable for any delay in making the payment if it does not receive funds before 10:00 a.m. one Business Day prior to the
payment date. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to procure that, before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day before
each payment date, the bank effecting payment for it has confirmed by email or facsimile to the Paying Agent the payment instructions relating to such
payment.

                                                                            30
      (b) If the Company shall act as its own Paying Agent, it will, on or before each due date of the principal (including the Redemption Price, the
Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes, set aside, segregate
and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes a sum sufficient to pay such principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price
and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) and accrued and unpaid interest so becoming due and will promptly notify the Trustee in
writing of any failure to take such action and of any failure by the Company to make any payment of the principal (including the Redemption Price, the
Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, or accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes when the same shall
become due and payable. Upon an Event of Default under Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j) hereof, the Trustee shall automatically become the Paying
Agent.

      (c) Anything in this Section 4.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture, or for any other reason, pay, cause to be paid or deliver to the Trustee all sums or amounts held by the Company in trust or
by any Paying Agent as required by this Section 4.04, such sums or amounts to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein contained and upon such
payment or delivery by the Company or any Paying Agent to the Trustee, the Company or such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability
but only with respect to such sums or amounts.

       (d) Any money and ADSs (or any Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the
Company, in trust for the payment of principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if
applicable) of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, any Note (or, in the case of ADSs or any Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof, in satisfaction of the
Conversion Obligation) and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) or interest has become due and payable or such Conversion Obligation has become due shall be
paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the Company on request of the Company contained in an Officers’ Certificate, or (if then held by the Company)
shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for
payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such money and ADSs (or any Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof),
and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being
required to make any such repayment or delivery, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the
English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice
that such money and ADSs (or any Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less
than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money and ADSs (or any Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) then remaining
will be repaid or delivered to the Company.

                                                                            31
      Section 4.05 Existence. Subject to Article 11, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force
and effect its corporate existence. The Company shall promptly provide the Trustee with written notice of any change to its name, jurisdiction of
incorporation or change to its corporate organization.

       Section 4.06 Rule 144A Information Requirement and Annual Reports. (a) At any time the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes, any ADSs deliverable upon conversion thereof or any Ordinary Shares underlying, or in
lieu of, ADSs deliverable upon conversion thereof shall, at such time, constitute “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
Securities Act, promptly provide to the Trustee and shall, upon written request, provide to any Holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of such
Notes or the ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) deliverable upon conversion of such Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act to facilitate the resale of such Notes or ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) pursuant to Rule 144A. The
Company shall take such further action as any Holder or beneficial owner of such Notes or such ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) may
reasonably request to the extent from time to time required to enable such Holder or beneficial owner to sell such Notes or ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in
lieu thereof) in accordance with Rule 144A, as such rule may be amended from time to time.

      (b) The Company shall provide to the Trustee within 15 days after the same are required to be filed with the Commission, copies of any
documents or reports that the Company is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (giving effect to
any applicable grace period provided by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act). Any such document or report that the Company files with the
Commission via the Commission’s EDGAR system (or any successor thereto) shall be deemed to be provided to the Trustee for purposes of this
Section 4.06(b) at the time such documents are filed via the EDGAR system (or any successor thereto). The Trustee shall have no obligation to
determine if and when the Company’s statements or reports are publically available and/or accessible electronically.

      (c) Delivery of the reports and documents described in subsection (b) above to the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice or knowledge of any information contained therein or determinable from information
contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on
an Officers’ Certificate).

                                                                           32
      (d) If, at any time during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance of
the Notes, the Company fails to timely file any document or report that it is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, as applicable (after (i) giving effect to all applicable grace periods thereunder and (ii) other than reports on Form 6-K to the extent such
reports are not required to satisfy the “current public information” requirement of Rule 144), or the Notes are not otherwise freely tradable pursuant to
Rule 144 by Holders other than the Company’s Affiliates or Holders that were the Company’s Affiliates at any time during the three months
immediately preceding (as a result of restrictions pursuant to U.S. securities laws or the terms of this Indenture or the Notes), the Company shall pay or
cause the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Company and subject to receipt of funds from the Company pursuant to the last paragraph in Section 4.04(a))
to pay Additional Interest on the Notes. Such Additional Interest shall accrue on the Notes at the rate of 0.50% per annum of the principal amount of the
Notes outstanding for each day during such period for which the Company’s failure to file has occurred and is continuing or the period during which the
Notes are not freely tradable, as described above, by Holders other than Affiliates of the Company (or Holders that were Affiliates of the Company
during the three months immediately preceding). As used in this Section 4.06(d), documents or reports that the Company is required to “file” with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act does not include documents or reports that the Company furnishes to the Commission
pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

       (e) If, and for so long as, (x) the restrictive legend on the Notes specified in Section 2.05(c) has not been removed, (y) the Notes are assigned a
restricted CUSIP or (z) the Notes are not otherwise freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 by Holders thereof without restrictions pursuant to U.S.
securities laws or the terms of this Indenture or the Notes (in each case (x), (y) and (z), except for the Notes that are owned by the Company’s Affiliates
or Holders that were the Company’s Affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding) as of the 370th day after the last date of
original issuance of the Notes, the Company shall pay or cause the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Company and subject to receipt of funds from the
Company pursuant to the last paragraph in Section 4.04(a)) to pay Additional Interest on the Notes at a rate equal to 0.50% per annum of the principal
amount of Notes outstanding until (x) the restrictive legend on the Notes has been removed in accordance with Section 2.05(c), (y) the Notes have been
assigned an unrestricted CUSIP and (z) the Notes are freely tradable by Holders thereof without restrictions pursuant to U.S. securities laws or the terms
of this Indenture or the Notes (in each case (x), (y) and (z), except for the Notes that are owned by the Company’s Affiliates or Holders that were the
Company’s Affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding).

     (f)   Additional Interest will be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date following accrual in the same manner as regular interest on the
Notes.

      (g) The Additional Interest that is payable in accordance with Section 4.06(d) or Section 4.06(e) shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
Additional Interest that may be payable as a result of the Company’s election pursuant to Section 6.03. In no event shall Additional Interest accrue on
any day under the terms of this Indenture (taking any Additional Interest payable pursuant to Section 4.06(d) and Section 4.06(e) together with any
Additional Interest payable pursuant to Section 6.03) at an annual rate in excess of 0.50%, in the aggregate, for any violation or Default caused by the
Company’s failure to be current in respect of its Exchange Act reporting obligations.

                                                                            33
       (h) If Additional Interest is payable by the Company pursuant to Section 4.06(d) or Section 4.06(e), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an
Officers’ Certificate to that effect stating (i) the amount of such Additional Interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which such Additional Interest is
payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives at the Corporate Trust Office such a certificate, the Trustee may assume without
inquiry that no such Additional Interest is payable. If the Company has paid such Additional Interest directly to the Persons entitled to it, the Company
shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment.

       Section 4.07 Additional Amounts. (a) All payments and deliveries made by, or on behalf of, the Company or any successor to the Company
under or with respect to this Indenture and the Notes, including, but not limited to, payments of principal (including, if applicable, the Redemption Price,
the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price), payments of interest and payments of cash and/or deliveries of ADSs (together
with payments of cash for any fractional ADS), including any Ordinary Shares deliverable upon conversion of Notes in lieu of such ADSs at a Holder’s
election, shall be made without withholding, deduction or reduction for any other collection at source for, or on account of, any present or future taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied (including any penalties and interest related thereto) (“applicable
taxes”) by or within any jurisdiction in which the Company or any successor to the Company is, for tax purposes, incorporated, organized or resident or
doing business (each, as applicable, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) or through which payment is made or deemed made (together with each
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, a “Relevant Jurisdiction,” and in each case, any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) unless such
withholding, deduction or reduction is required by law or by regulation or governmental policy having the force of law. In the event that any such
withholding, deduction or reduction is so required, the Company or any successor to the Company shall pay or deliver to each Holder such additional
amounts of cash or ADSs (or additional amounts of Ordinary Shares if such Holder elects to receive Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable
upon conversion), as applicable (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by the beneficial owner of the
Notes after such withholding, deduction or reduction (and after deducting any taxes on the Additional Amounts) shall equal the amounts that would
have been received by such beneficial owner had no such withholding, deduction or reduction been required; provided that no Additional Amounts shall
be payable:
            (i)   for or on account of:
                    (A)   any applicable taxes that would not have been imposed but for:
                         (1) the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of such Note and the
                    Relevant Jurisdiction, other than merely acquiring or holding such Note, receiving ADSs or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof (together
                    with the payment of cash for any fractional ADS) or the receipt of payments or the exercise or enforcement of rights thereunder,
                    including, without limitation, such Holder or beneficial owner being or having been a national, domiciliary or resident of such
                    Relevant Jurisdiction or treated as a resident thereof or being or having been physically present or engaged in a trade or business
                    therein or having had a permanent establishment therein;

                                                                              34
           (2) the presentation of such Note (in cases in which presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the date on
      which the payment of the principal of (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and Fundamental Change Repurchase
      Price, if applicable) and interest on, such Note or the payment of cash and/or the delivery of ADSs or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof
      (together with payment of cash for any fractional ADS) upon conversion of such Note became due and payable pursuant to the terms
      thereof or was made or duly provided for;
            (3) the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner to comply with a timely written request from the Company or any successor
      of the Company, addressed to the Holder, to the extent such Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled, to provide certification,
      information, documents or other evidence concerning such Holder’s or beneficial owner’s nationality, residence, identity or
      connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, or to make any declaration or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to
      such matters, if and to the extent that due and timely compliance with such request is required by statute, regulation or
      administrative practice of the Relevant Jurisdiction in order to reduce or eliminate any withholding or deduction as to which
      Additional Amounts would have otherwise been payable to such Holder or beneficial owner; or
           (4) the presentation of such Note (in cases in which presentation is required) for payment in the Relevant Jurisdiction, unless
      such Note could not have been presented for payment elsewhere;
      (B) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar applicable tax or any excise or similar taxes imposed
with respect to a transfer;
     (C) any applicable tax that is payable otherwise than by withholding, deduction or reduction for any other collection at source
from payments or deliveries under or with respect to the Notes;
      (D) any applicable tax required to be withheld or deducted under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor
versions of such Sections) (“FATCA”), any regulations or other official guidance thereunder, any intergovernmental agreement or
agreement pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code entered into in connection with FATCA, or any law, regulation or other official
guidance enacted in any jurisdiction implementing FATCA or an intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with FATCA; or

                                                               35
                    (E)   any combination of applicable taxes referred to in the preceding clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D); or
            (ii) with respect to any payment of the principal of (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change
      Repurchase Price, if applicable), and interest on, such Note or the payment of cash and/or the delivery of ADSs or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof
      (together with payment of cash for any fractional ADS) upon conversion of such Note, to a Holder, if the Holder is a fiduciary, partnership or
      person other than the sole beneficial owner of that payment to the extent that such payment would be required to be included in the income under
      the laws of the Relevant Jurisdiction, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a partner or member of that
      partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such Additional Amounts had that beneficiary, settlor, partner, member or
      beneficial owner been the Holder thereof.

       (b) If the Company or its successor becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment or delivery under or with
respect to the Notes, the Company or its successor shall deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, if other than the Trustee, on a date that is at least 30
days prior to the date of that payment or delivery (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to that payment date,
in which case the Company or its successor shall notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent promptly thereafter) an Officers’ Certificate stating the fact
that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officers’ Certificate must also set forth any other information
reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agent or the Conversion Agent, as the case may be, (on behalf of the Company and subject to receipt of funds
from the Company pursuant to the last paragraph in Section 4.04(a)) to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officers’ Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Company or
its successor shall provide the Trustee and the Paying Agent with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of
Additional Amounts.

       (c) The Company or its successor shall make all withholdings and deductions required by law and shall remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. Upon request, the Company or its successor shall provide to the Trustee an
official receipt or, if official receipts are not obtainable, an Officers’ Certificate evidencing the payment of any applicable taxes so deducted or withheld.
Copies of those receipts or other documentation, as the case may be, shall be made available by the Trustee to the Holders of the Notes upon written
request.

       (d) Any reference in this Indenture or the Notes in any context to the payment of cash and/or the delivery of ADSs or Ordinary Shares in lieu
thereof (together with payment of cash for any fractional ADS) upon conversion of any Note or the payment of principal of (including the Redemption
Price, the Repurchase Price and Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) and any interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Note
or any other amount payable with respect to such Note, shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable with respect to that amount pursuant to this Section 4.07.

                                                                              36
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions, the Company or its successor, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to make any
withholding or deduction pursuant to FATCA.

       (f) If the Company or its successor is required to make any deduction or withholding from any payments or deliveries with respect to the Notes,
it will deliver to the Trustee official tax receipts evidencing the remittance to the relevant tax authorities of the amounts so withheld or deducted.

      (g)   The foregoing obligations shall survive termination or discharge of this Indenture.

       Section 4.08 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time
insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law that would
prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest on the Notes as contemplated herein, wherever enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, or that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay
or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law
had been enacted.

       Section 4.09 Compliance Certificate; Statements as to Defaults. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each
fiscal year of the Company (beginning with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2021) an Officers’ Certificate stating that a review has been
conducted of the Company’s activities under this Indenture and the Company has fulfilled its obligations hereunder, and whether the authorized Officers
thereof have knowledge of any Default by the Company that occurred during the previous year that is then continuing and, if so, specifying each such
Default and the nature thereof.

       In addition, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, as soon as possible, and in any event within 30 days after the Company becomes aware of
the occurrence of any Default if such Default is then continuing, an Officers’ Certificate setting forth the details of such Default, its status and the action
that the Company is taking or proposing to take in respect thereof. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to take any steps to ascertain whether any
Event of Default or Default has occurred, and until (i) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received an Officers’ Certificate regarding such an
occurrence, or (ii) the Trustee has received written notice at the Corporate Trust Office from the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding regarding such an occurrence, the Trustee is entitled to assume, without liability, that no Event of Default or Default has
occurred.

      Section 4.10 Further Instruments and Acts. The Company will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be
reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Indenture.

                                                                              37

                                  LISTS OF HOLDERS AND REPORTS BY THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE

      Section 5.01 Lists of Holders. The Company covenants and agrees that it will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee, semi-annually, not
more than 15 days after each June 1 and December 1 in each year beginning with June 1, 2022, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in
writing, within 30 days after receipt by the Company of any such request (or such lesser time as the Trustee may reasonably request in order to enable it
to timely provide any notice to be provided by it hereunder), a list in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the
Holders as of a date not more than 15 days (or such other date as the Trustee may reasonably request in order to so provide any such notices) prior to the
time such information is furnished, except that no such list need be furnished so long as the Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is acting as Note
Registrar.

       Section 5.02 Preservation and Disclosure of Lists. The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information
as to the names and addresses of the Holders contained in the most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 5.01 or maintained by the Trustee in
its capacity as Note Registrar, if so acting. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 5.01 upon receipt of a new list so
furnished.


                                                                   ARTICLE 6

      Section 6.01    Events of Default. The following events shall be “Events of Default” with respect to the Notes:

      (a) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable and the default continues for a period

                                                                            38
      (g) default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company with respect to any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under
which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any indebtedness for money borrowed in excess of US$50 million (or
the foreign currency equivalent thereof) in the aggregate of the Company and/or any such Significant Subsidiary, whether such indebtedness now exists
or shall hereafter be created (i) resulting in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable or (ii) constituting a failure to pay the
principal or interest of any such debt when due and payable at its stated maturity, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or
otherwise;

       (h) a final judgment for the payment of US$50 million (or the foreign currency equivalent thereof) or more (excluding any amounts covered by
insurance) rendered against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, which judgment is not paid, bonded or otherwise discharged or
stayed within 60 days after (i) the date on which the right to appeal thereof has expired if no such appeal has commenced, or (ii) the date on which all
rights to appeal have been extinguished;

       (i) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other
relief with respect to the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter
in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any such Significant
Subsidiary or any substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in
an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to
pay its debts as they become due; or

      (j) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary seeking liquidation,
reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or such Significant Subsidiary or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or such
Significant Subsidiary or any substantial part of its property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a
period of 30 consecutive days.

                                                                             39
       Section 6.02 Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. If one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the
reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree
or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), then, and in each and every such case (other than an
Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j) with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries), unless the principal
of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable, the Trustee may by notice in writing to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04, by notice in writing to the Company and to the
Trustee may, and the Trustee at the written request of such Holders shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its reasonable
satisfaction), declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such
declaration the same shall become and shall automatically be immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture or in
the Notes to the contrary. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j) with respect to the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries occurs and is continuing, 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all Notes shall become and shall automatically be
immediately due and payable without any action on the part of the Trustee. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, all agents of the Company
appointed under this Indenture will be required to act on the direction of the Trustee.

       The immediately preceding paragraph, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so
declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter
provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Notes and
the principal of any and all Notes that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and
unpaid interest to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, and on such principal at the rate per annum borne by the
Notes plus one percent) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.06, and if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of
a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any and all existing Events of Default under this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest on Notes that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 6.09,
then and in every such case (except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all Defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Notes and
rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be
deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any
subsequent Default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no such waiver
or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any Default or Event of Default resulting from (i) the nonpayment of the principal of, or
accrued and unpaid interest on, any Notes, (ii) a failure to repurchase any Notes when required or (iii) a failure to pay or deliver, as the case may be, the
consideration due upon conversion of the Notes.

      Section 6.03 Additional Interest. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture or in the Notes to the contrary, to the extent the Company elects,
the sole remedy for Event of Default relating to the Company’s failure to comply with its obligations as set forth in Section 4.06(b) shall after the
occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of the right to receive Additional Interest on the Notes at a rate equal to:

       (a) 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding for each day during the period beginning on, and including, the date on
which such an Event of Default first occurs and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured or validly waived and
(ii) the 90th day immediately following, and including, the date on which such Event of Default first occurred; and

                                                                             40
       (b) if such Event of Default has not been cured or validly waived prior to the 91st day immediately following, and including, the date on which
such Event of Default first occurred, 0.50% per annum of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding for each day during the period beginning on,
and including, the 91st day immediately following, and including, the date on which such an Event of Default first occurred and ending on the earlier of
(i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured or validly waived and (ii) the 180th day immediately following, and including, the date on which
such Event of Default first occurred.

      Interest payable pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, any Additional Interest payable pursuant to Section 4.06(d) or
Section 4.06(e). In no event shall Additional Interest accrue on the Notes on any day under this Indenture (taking any Additional Interest payable
pursuant to this Section 6.03 together with any Additional Interest payable pursuant to Section 4.06(d) and Section 4.06(e)) at an annual rate accruing in
excess of 0.50%, in the aggregate, for any violation or Default caused by the Company’s failure to be current in respect of its Exchange Act reporting
obligations. If the Company so elects, such Additional Interest shall be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as regular interest on the
Notes. On the 181st day after such Event of Default (if the Event of Default with respect to the Company’s obligations under Section 4.06(b) is not
cured or waived prior to such 181st day), the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 6.02. In the event the Company does not elect
to pay Additional Interest following an Event of Default in accordance with this Section 6.03 or the Company elected to make such payment but does
not pay the Additional Interest when due, the Notes shall be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 6.02.

       In order to elect to pay Additional Interest as the sole remedy during the first 180 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default described in
the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company must notify in writing all Holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Paying Agent of such election
prior to the beginning of such 180-day period. Upon the failure to timely give such notice, the Notes shall be immediately subject to acceleration as
provided in Section 6.02.

      Section 6.04 Payments of Notes on Default; Suit Therefor. If an Event of Default described in clause (a) or (b)of Section 6.01 shall have
occurred, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee acting in its own discretion or at the request of Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04 and subject to indemnity and/or security and/or pre-funding
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on the
Notes for principal and interest, if any, with interest on any overdue principal and interest, if any, at the rate per annum borne by the Notes at such time
plus one percent, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.06. If the
Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the
same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law
out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes, wherever situated.

                                                                             41
       In the event there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes
under Title 11 of the United States Code, or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization,
liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Company or such other obligor, the property of the
Company or such other obligor, or in the event of any other judicial proceedings relative to the Company or such other obligor upon the Notes, or to the
creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable
as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 6.04, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole
amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, in respect of the Notes, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim
and other papers or documents and to take such other actions as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including
any claim for the compensation, properly incurred expenses, properly incurred disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of
the Holders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on the Notes, its or their creditors, or its or their property,
and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of any
amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, custodian or similar
official is hereby authorized by each of the Holders to make such payments to the Trustee, as administrative expenses, and, in the event that the Trustee
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for compensation, properly incurred
expenses, advances and properly incurred disbursements, including agents and counsel fees and expenses, and including any other amounts due to the
Trustee under Section 7.06, incurred by it up to the date of such distribution. To the extent that such payment of compensation, properly incurred
expenses, advances and properly incurred disbursements out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same
shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, monies, securities and other property that the Holders of the
Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.

       Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting such Holder or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote
in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

       All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession
of any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee
shall be brought in its own name or as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the
compensation, properly incurred expenses, properly incurred disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable
benefit of the Holders of the Notes.

                                                                             42
      In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of the
Notes parties to any such proceedings.

      In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or
abandoned because of any waiver pursuant to Section 6.09 or any rescission and annulment pursuant to Section 6.02 or for any other reason or shall
have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Holders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the
Company, the Holders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

      Section 6.05 Application of Monies Collected by Trustee. Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 6 with respect to the
Notes shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon presentation of the
several Notes, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:

     First, to the payment of all amounts due to the Trustee, including to its agents and counsel, under Section 7.06 and any payments due to the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Conversion Agent and the Note Registrar;

       Second, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on, the Notes in default
in the order of the date due of the payments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon such
overdue payments at the rate per annum borne by the Notes at such time (including, without duplication, any additional interest on such overdue
payments pursuant to Section 6.04), such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto;

       Third, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, and be unpaid to the payment of the
whole amount (including, if applicable, the payment of the Redemption Price, Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and any cash
due upon conversion) then owing and unpaid upon the Notes for principal and interest, if any, with interest on the overdue principal and, to the extent
that such interest has been collected by the Trustee, upon overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Notes at such time plus one
percent, and in case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Notes, then to the payment of such
principal (including, if applicable, the Redemption Price, Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and the cash due upon conversion)
and interest without preference or priority of principal over interest, or of interest over principal or of any installment of interest over any other

Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price) and accrued and unpaid interest; and

                                                                            43
      Fourth, to the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company.

       Section 6.06 Proceedings by Holders. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal (including, if applicable, the Redemption
Price, the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price) or interest when due, or the right to receive payment or delivery of the
consideration due upon conversion, no Holder of any Note shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute
any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator,
custodian or other similar official, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

      (a) such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof, as herein
provided;

       (b) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to
institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder;

       (c) such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee such security and/or indemnity and/or pre-funding reasonably satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense to be incurred therein or thereby;

     (d) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of security and/or indemnity and/or pre-funding, shall have not
complied with such written request of the Holders to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and

      (e) no direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the Holders
of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding within such 60-day period pursuant to Section 6.09,

it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Note with every other taker and Holder and the
Trustee that no one or more Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect,
disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holder, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any
right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders (except as otherwise
provided herein). For the protection and enforcement of this Section 6.06, each and every Holder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be
given either at law or in equity.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and any provision of any Note, the right of any Holder to receive payment or delivery, as
the case may be, of (x) the principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if
applicable) of, (y) accrued and unpaid interest on, and (z) the consideration due upon conversion of, such Note, on or after the respective due dates
expressed or provided for in such Note or in this Indenture, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment or delivery, as the case may be,
on or after such respective dates against the Company shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

                                                                              44
      Section 6.07 Proceedings by Trustee. In case of an Event of Default, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights
vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as are necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity
or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this
Indenture or by law.

      Section 6.08 Remedies Cumulative and Continuing. Except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.06, all powers and remedies given by
this Article 6 to the Trustee or to the Holders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any
other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or
observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any of the Notes to
exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of
any such Default or Event of Default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.06, every power and remedy given by this
Article 6 or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by
the Holders.

       Section 6.09 Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by Majority of Holders. The Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to Notes;
provided, however, that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other
action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability, or if it is not provided with security and/or indemnity and/or pre-funding to its reasonable satisfaction, or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder. In addition, the Trustee will not be required to expend its own funds under any
circumstances. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04
may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the
payment of accrued and unpaid interest on, or the principal (including, if applicable, the Redemption Price, Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price) of, the Notes when due that has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02, (ii) a failure by the Company to pay or
deliver, or cause to be delivered, as the case may be, the consideration due upon conversion of the Notes or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or
provision hereof which under Article 10 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected. Upon any
such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder; but no such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any Default or Event of Default
hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 6.09, said Default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this
Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of
Default or impair any right consequent thereon

                                                                             45
       Section 6.10 Notice of Defaults and Events of Default. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is notified in writing to a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall, within 90 days after the occurrence and continuance of such Default or Event of Default, mail to all
Holders (at the Company’s expense) as the names and addresses of such Holders appear upon the Note Register, notice of all Defaults so notified in
writing, unless such Defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice; provided that the Trustee shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice. Except in the case
of a Default in the payment of the principal of (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if
applicable), or accrued and unpaid interest on, any of the Notes or a Default in the payment or delivery of the consideration due upon conversion, the
Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the Trustee’s board of directors, a Responsible Officer, an executive committee or
a committee of Responsible Officers of the Trustee (in its sole discretion) in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests
of the Holders.

       Section 6.11 Undertaking to Pay Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Note by its acceptance thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in
any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs
of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess costs, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having
due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section 6.11 (to the
extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any suit instituted by or against the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding
in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04, or to any suit
instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest on any Note (including, but not limited to,
the Redemption Price and the Repurchase Price and Fundamental Change Repurchase Price with respect to the Notes being repurchased as provided in
this Indenture) on or after the due date expressed or provided for in such Note or to any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note in
accordance with the provisions of Article 14.

                                                                              46
                                                                    ARTICLE 7
                                                              CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

       Section 7.01 Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee. The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiver of
all Events of Default that may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no
implied covenants or obligations will be read into the Indenture against the Trustee. In case an Event of Default, of which the Trustee has actual written
notice, has occurred that has not been cured or waived the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the
same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own
affairs; provided that if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or
pre-funding reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.

       No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent
failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

      (a)   prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default that may have occurred:
            (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall
      not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or
      obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
            (ii) in the absence of gross negligence and willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, as proven in a final decision of a court of
      competent jurisdiction, the Trustee may conclusively and without liability rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions
      expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case
      of any such certificates or opinions that by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under
      a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate
      the accuracy of any mathematical calculations or other facts, statements, opinions or conclusions stated therein);

      (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee,
unless it shall be proved in a final decision in a court of competent jurisdiction that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

       (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with (i) the direction
of the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined as provided in Section 8.04
relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
upon the Trustee, under this Indenture or (ii) the direction of Holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time
outstanding determined as provided in Section 8.04 as per Section 6.02;

                                                                              47
       (d) whether or not therein provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of, or affording protection
to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section;

      (e) the Trustee shall not be liable in respect of any payment (as to the correctness of amount, entitlement to receive or any other matters relating
to payment) or notice effected by the Company or any Paying Agent or any records maintained by any co-Note Registrar with respect to the Notes;

      (f) if any party fails to deliver a notice relating to an event the fact of which, pursuant to this Indenture, requires notice to be sent to the Trustee,
the Trustee may conclusively and without liability rely on its failure to receive such notice as reason to act as if no such event occurred;

      (g)   [RESERVED]

      (h) in the event that the Trustee is also acting as Note Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Transfer Agent hereunder, the rights,
immunities, privileges, disclaimers from liability and protections (including the right to compensation and indemnity) afforded to the Trustee pursuant to
this Article 7 shall also be afforded to such Note Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Transfer Agent;

       (i) the Trustee shall have no duty to inquire, no duty to determine and no duty to monitor as to the performance of the Company’s covenants in
this Indenture or the financial performance of the Company; the Trustee shall be entitled to assume, until it has received written notice in accordance
with this Indenture, that the Company is properly performing its duties hereunder;

      (j) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to enforce any of the provisions of this Indenture unless it is instructed by Holders of at least 25% of
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes and is provided with security and/or indemnity and/or pre-funding reasonably satisfactory to it;

     (k) the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the
Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or pre-funding reasonably satisfactory to it against any costs,
expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such requests or direction.

       (l) before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers’ Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel prepared and delivered at the
cost of the Company conforming to Section 17.06 and the Trustee and the Agents may rely conclusively on such certificate or opinion and will not be
liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers’ Certificate or Opinion of Counsel;

                                                                              48
      (m) in connection with the exercise by it of its trusts, powers, authorities or discretions (including, without limitation, any modification, waiver,
authorization or determination), the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Holders as a class but shall not have regard to any interests
arising from circumstances particular to individual Holders (whatever their number) and in particular, but without limitation, shall not have regard to the
consequences of the exercise of its trusts, powers, authorities or discretions for individual Holders (whatever their number) resulting from their being for
any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any country, state or territory; and

of any fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality, or any law, rule, regulation, or any decree, order or judgment of any court, or practice, request, direction,
notice, announcement or similar action (whether or not having the force of law) of any relevant government, government agency, regulatory authority,
stock exchange or self-regulatory organization to which the Trustee is subject. The Trustee may without liability do anything which is, in its reasonable
opinion, necessary to comply with any such law, directive or regulations.

       None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.

      Section 7.02    Reliance on Documents, Opinions, Etc. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01:

      (a) the Trustee may conclusively and without liability rely and shall be fully protected in acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, Note, coupon or other paper or document (whether in its original or facsimile form)
believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

       (b) any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers’ Certificate (unless
other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any Board Resolution may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof
certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company;

      (c) the Trustee may consult with counsel and require an Opinion of Counsel and any advice of such counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full
and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or

further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or
investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney at the expense of the
Company and shall incur no liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation;

                                                                              49

damage and regardless of the form of action; this provision shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the discharge of the Notes, the
termination of this Indenture or the resignation, replacement or removal of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Conversion Agent and
the Note Registrar;

       (h) the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Conversion Agent and the Note Registrar may refrain from taking any action in any
jurisdiction if the taking of such action in that jurisdiction would, in its opinion based upon legal advice in the relevant jurisdiction, be contrary to any
law of that jurisdiction or, to the extent applicable, of New York; furthermore, the Trustee may also refrain from taking such action if it would otherwise
render it liable to any person in that jurisdiction or New York or if, in its opinion based on such legal advice, it would not have the power to do the
relevant thing in that jurisdiction by virtue of any applicable law in that jurisdiction or in New York or if it is determined by any court or other
competent authority in that jurisdiction that it does not have such power;

delivered and not superseded;

      (l) the Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it reasonably believes to be
authorized or within its rights or powers;

                                                                             50

incompleteness of such information; and

Agent or Note Registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may engage in business and contractual relationships with the Company or its Affiliates
and may become the owner or pledgee of Notes with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Note
Registrar, and nothing herein shall obligate any of them to account for any profits earned from any business or transactional relationship.

      Section 7.05 Monies to Be Held in Trust. All monies received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for
the purposes for which they were received. Money held by the Trustee in trust or by the Paying Agent hereunder need not be segregated from other

hereunder.

                                                                             51
      Section 7.06 Compensation and Expenses of Trustee. (a) The Company covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the
Trustee shall be entitled to, compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder in any capacity (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) as mutually agreed to in writing between the Trustee and the Company (which sum shall be
paid free and clear of deduction and withholding on account of taxation, set-off and counterclaim), and the Company will pay or reimburse the Trustee
upon its request for all properly incurred expenses, disbursements and advances properly incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any of the
provisions of this Indenture in any capacity thereunder (including the compensation and the properly incurred expenses and disbursements of its agents
and counsel and of all Persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as shall have been caused by its gross
negligence or willful misconduct as proven in a final decision in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Company also covenants to indemnify the
Trustee (which for the purposes of this Section 7.06 shall be deemed to include its officers, directors, agents and employees) in any capacity under this
Indenture (including without limitation as Note Registrar, Transfer Agent, Conversion Agent and Paying Agent) and any other document or transaction
entered into in connection herewith, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (whether arising from third party
claims or claims by or against the Company) incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, its officers, directors,
agents or employees, as the case may be, as proven in a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of this Indenture or in any other capacity hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending themselves against any
claim of liability in the process of enforcing this indemnity. The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.06 to compensate or indemnify the
Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall be secured by a senior claim to which the Notes are hereby
made subordinate on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except, subject to the effect of Section 6.05, funds held in trust herewith for
the benefit of the Holders of particular Notes. The Trustee’s right to receive payment of any amounts due under this Section 7.06 shall not be
subordinate to any other liability or indebtedness of the Company. The indemnity under this Section 7.06(a) is payable upon demand by the Trustee. The
obligation of the Company under this Section 7.06(a) shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, the termination or discharge of this
Indenture and the resignation, replacement or removal of the Trustee. The indemnification provided in this Section 7.06(a) shall extend to the officers,
directors, agents and employees of the Trustee. Subject to Section 7.02(e), any negligence or misconduct of any agent, delegate, attorney or
representative, in each case, of the Trustee, shall not affect indemnification of the Trustee.

      Without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under applicable law, when the Trustee and its agents incur expenses or render
services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended
to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws. If a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or if the
Trustee finds it expedient or necessary or is requested by the Company and/or the Holders to undertake duties which are of an exceptional nature or
otherwise outside the scope of the Trustee’s normal duties under this Indenture, the Company will pay such additional remuneration as the Company and
the Trustee may separately agree in writing.

                                                                            52
      (b) The Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Conversion Agent and the Note Registrar shall be entitled to the compensation to be agreed upon
in writing with the Company for all services rendered by it under this Indenture, and the Company agrees promptly to pay such compensation and to
reimburse the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Conversion Agent and the Note Registrar for its out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and
expenses of counsel) properly incurred by it in connection with the services rendered by it under this Indenture. The Company hereby agrees to
indemnify the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Conversion Agent and the Note Registrar and their respective officers, directors, agents and
employees and any successors thereto for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense (including fees and expenses of counsel)
properly incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part arising out of or in connection with its acting as the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Conversion Agent and the Note Registrar hereunder. The obligations of the Company under this paragraph (b) shall survive the
payment of the Notes, the termination or discharge of the Indenture and the resignation, replacement or removal of the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Conversion Agent and the Note Registrar.

       Section 7.07 Officers’ Certificate as Evidence. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions
of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or omitting any action hereunder,
such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an
Officers’ Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such Officers’ Certificate shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it
under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

       Section 7.08 Eligibility of Trustee. There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust
Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least US$50,000,000. If such Person publishes reports of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of any supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital
and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at
any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

       Section 7.09 Resignation or Removal of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may at any time resign by giving 30 days written notice of such resignation to
the Company and by mailing notice thereof to the Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the Note Register. Upon receiving such notice of
resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors,
one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so
appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation to the Holders, the resigning Trustee may at the
expense of the Company petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 6.11, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly
situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper
and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.

                                                                             53
      (b)   In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
            (i) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.08 and shall fail to resign after written request
      therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
           (ii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
      property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
      rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in either case, the Company may by a Board Resolution remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate,
executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor
trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months may, on
behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the
appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and
appoint a successor trustee.

      (c) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, as determined in accordance with
Section 8.04, may at any time remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee that shall be deemed appointed as successor trustee unless within ten
days after notice to the Company of such nomination the Company objects thereto, in which case the Trustee so removed or any Holder, upon the terms
and conditions and otherwise as in Section 7.09(a) provided, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor trustee.

     (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 7.09 shall
become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 7.10.

       Section 7.10 Acceptance by Successor Trustee. Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 7.09 shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver to the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of
the predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the
written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due to it pursuant to the
provisions of Section 7.06, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to
act. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a senior claim to which the Notes
are hereby made subordinate on all money or property held or collected by such trustee as such, except for funds held in trust for the benefit of Holders
of particular Notes, to secure any amounts then due to it pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.06.

                                                                             54
       No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 7.10 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 7.08.

       Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section 7.10, each of the Company and the successor trustee, at the
written direction and at the expense of the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder to the Holders at
their addresses as they shall appear on the Note Register. If the Company fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the
successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Company.

      Section 7.11 Succession by Merger, Etc. Any corporation or other entity into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any corporation or other entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or
any corporation or other entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee (including the administration of this
Indenture), shall be the successor to the Trustee hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto; provided that in the case of any corporation or other entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee such
corporation or other entity shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 7.08.

        In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Notes shall have been
authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such
Notes so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such
Notes either in the name of any predecessor trustee hereunder or in the name of the successor trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have
the full force which it is anywhere in the Notes or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, however, that the
right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee or to authenticate Notes in the name of any predecessor trustee shall apply only
to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

       Section 7.12 Trustee’s Application for Instructions from the Company. Any application by the Trustee for written instructions from the
Company (other than with regard to any action proposed to be taken or omitted to be taken by the Trustee that affects the rights of the Holders of the
Notes under this Indenture) may, at the option of the Trustee, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Trustee under this
Indenture and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action
taken by, or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such application on or after the date specified in such application (which
date shall not be less than three Business Days after the date any officer that the Company has indicated to the Trustee should receive such application
actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to any earlier date), unless, prior to taking any such action (or
the effective date in the case of any omission), the Trustee shall have received written instructions in accordance with this Indenture in response to such
application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.

                                                                              55
                                                                  ARTICLE 8
                                                            CONCERNING THE HOLDERS

       Section 8.01 Action by Holders. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of
any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action, the Holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced
(a) by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by Holders in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by
the record of the Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of Holders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article 9, or (c) by
a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Holders. Whenever the Company or the Trustee solicits the
taking of any action by the Holders of the Notes, the Company or the Trustee may fix, but shall not be required to, in advance of such solicitation, a date
as the record date for determining Holders entitled to take such action. The record date if one is selected shall be not more than fifteen days prior to the
date of commencement of solicitation of such action.

       Section 8.02 Proof of Execution by Holders. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, Section 7.02 and Section 9.05, proof of the execution of
any instrument by a Holder or its agent or proxy shall be sufficient if made in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be
prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The holding of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register or by a
certificate of the Note Registrar. The record of any Holders’ meeting shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 9.06.

      Section 8.03 Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners. The Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Conversion Agent and any Note Registrar
may deem the Person in whose name a Note shall be registered upon the Note Register to be, and may treat it as, the absolute owner of such Note
(whether or not such Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by any Person other than the
Company or any Note Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and (subject to Section 2.03) accrued and
unpaid interest on such Note, for the purpose of conversion of such Note and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any
Paying Agent nor any Conversion Agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments or deliveries so made
to any Holder for the time being, or upon its order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sums or ADSs so paid or delivered, effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability for monies payable or ADSs deliverable upon any such Note. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the
Notes following an Event of Default, any Holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note may directly enforce against the Company, without the
consent, solicitation, proxy, authorization or any other action of the Depositary or any other Person, such Holder’s right to exchange such beneficial
interest for a Note in certificated form in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

                                                                             56
       Section 8.04 Company-Owned Notes Disregarded. In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Notes
have concurred in any direction, consent, waiver or other action under this Indenture, Notes that are owned by the Company, by any Subsidiary or
Consolidated Affiliated Entity thereof or by any Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary or Consolidated Affiliated Entity thereof shall be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination; provided that for the purposes of determining whether the
Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent, waiver or other action only Notes in respect of which a Responsible Officer is
notified in writing shall be so disregarded. Notes so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this
Section 8.04 if the pledgee shall establish its right to so act with respect to such Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company, a Subsidiary or
Consolidated Affiliated Entity thereof or an Affiliate of the Company or a Subsidiary or Consolidated Affiliated Entity thereof. Within five days of
acquisition of the Notes by any of the above described persons or entities or at the request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee
promptly an Officers’ Certificate listing and identifying all Notes, if any, known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the
above described Persons; and, subject to Section 7.01, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers’ Certificate as conclusive evidence of the
facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Notes not listed therein are outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.

      Section 8.05 Revocation of Consents; Future Holders Bound. At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in
Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes specified in this Indenture in
connection with such action, any Holder of a Note that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Notes the Holders of which have consented to
such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke
such action so far as concerns such Note. Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the Holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding upon
such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Note and of any Notes issued in exchange or substitution therefor or upon registration of
transfer thereof, irrespective of whether any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Note or any Note issued in exchange or substitution therefor or
upon registration of transfer thereof.


                                                                    ARTICLE 9
                                                                HOLDERS’ MEETINGS

      Section 9.01 Purpose of Meetings. A meeting of Holders may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this
Article 9 for any of the following purposes:

      (a) to give any notice to the Company or to the Trustee or to give any directions to the Trustee permitted under this Indenture, or to consent to
the waiving of any Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences, or to take any other action authorized to be taken by Holders pursuant to
any of the provisions of Article 6;

      (b)   to remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee pursuant to the provisions of Article 7;

                                                                           57
      (c)   to consent to the execution of an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.02; or

      (d) to take any other action authorized to be taken by or on behalf of the Holders of any specified aggregate principal amount of the Notes under
any other provision of this Indenture or under applicable law.

      Section 9.02 Call of Meetings by Trustee. The Trustee may (in its sole discretion and without obligation) at any time call a meeting of Holders
to take any action specified in Section 9.01, to be held at such time and at such place as the Trustee shall determine. Notice of every meeting of the
Holders, setting forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting and the establishment
of any record date pursuant to Section 8.01, shall be mailed to Holders of such Notes at their addresses as they shall appear on the Note Register. Such
notice shall also be mailed to the Company. Such notices shall be mailed not less than 20 nor more than 90 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting.

      Any meeting of Holders shall be valid without notice if the Holders of all Notes then outstanding are present in person or by proxy or if notice is
waived before or after the meeting by the Holders of all Notes then outstanding, and if the Company and the Trustee are either present by duly
authorized representatives or have, before or after the meeting, waived notice.

       Section 9.03 Call of Meetings by Company or Holders. In case at any time the Company, pursuant to a Board Resolution, or the Holders of at
least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, shall have requested the Company to call a meeting of Holders, by written
request setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Company shall not have mailed the notice of such
meeting within 20 days after receipt of such request, then the Trustee or such Holders may determine the time and the place for such meeting and may
call such meeting to take any action authorized in Section 9.01, by mailing notice thereof as provided in Section 9.02.

       Section 9.04 Qualifications for Voting. To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders a Person shall (a) be a Holder of one or more Notes on
the record date pertaining to such meeting or (b) be a Person appointed by an instrument in writing as proxy by a Holder of one or more Notes on the
record date pertaining to such meeting. The only Persons who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Holders shall be the Persons
entitled to vote at such meeting and their counsel and any representatives of the Trustee and its counsel and any representatives of the Company and its
counsel.

      Section 9.05 Regulations. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may
deem advisable for any meeting of Holders, in regard to proof of the holding of Notes and of the appointment of proxies, and in regard to the
appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such
other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall think fit.

                                                                            58
     The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the
Company or by Holders as provided in Section 9.03, in which case the Company or the Holders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like
manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes represented at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting.

      Subject to the provisions of Section 8.04, at any meeting of Holders each Holder or proxyholder shall be entitled to one vote for each US$1,000
principal amount of Notes held or represented by him or her; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any
Note challenged as not outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to
vote other than by virtue of Notes held by it or instruments in writing as aforesaid duly designating it as the proxy to vote on behalf of other Holders.
Any meeting of Holders duly called pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 may be adjourned from time to time by the Holders of a
majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented at the meeting, whether or not constituting a quorum, and the meeting may be held as so
adjourned without further notice.

        Minutes shall be made of all resolutions and proceedings at every meeting and, if purporting to be signed by the chairman of that meeting or of the
next succeeding meeting of Holders of the Notes, shall be conclusive evidence of the matters in them. Until the contrary is proved every meeting for
which minutes have been so made and signed shall be deemed to have been duly convened and held and all resolutions passed or proceedings transacted
at it to have been duly passed and transacted.

       Section 9.06 Voting. The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Holders shall be by written ballot on which shall be subscribed
the signatures of the Holders or of their representatives by proxy and the outstanding principal amount of the Notes held or represented by them. The
permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any resolution and
who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record in duplicate
of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be attached to said record the original
reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more Persons having knowledge of the facts setting forth a
copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that said notice was mailed as provided in Section 9.02. The record shall show the principal amount of
the Notes voting in favor of or against any resolution. The record shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary
of the meeting and one of the duplicates shall be delivered to the Company and the other to the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have
attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting.

      Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated.

      Section 9.07 No Delay of Rights by Meeting. Nothing contained in this Article 9 shall be deemed or construed to authorize or permit, by reason
of any call of a meeting of Holders or any rights expressly or impliedly conferred hereunder to make such call, any hindrance or delay in the exercise of
any right or rights conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders under any of the provisions of this Indenture or of the Notes.

                                                                             59

       Upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any such amendment or

shall not be obligated to, but may in its discretion, enter into any supplemental indenture that affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under
this Indenture or otherwise. The Trustee shall seek an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, at the Company’s expense, that any such
amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes is authorized and permitted by the terms of this Indenture and not contrary to law.

                                                                             60
      Any amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes authorized by the provisions of this Section 10.01 may be executed by the Company
and the Trustee without the consent of the Holders of any of the Notes at the time outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 10.02.

      Section 10.02 Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders. With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article 8) of the Holders of at least
a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (determined in accordance with Article 8 and including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a repurchase of, or tender or exchange offer for, Notes), the Company, when authorized by the resolutions of the
Board of Directors, and the Trustee, at the Company’s expense, may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures
supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or any
supplemental indenture or the Notes or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders; provided, however, that, without the consent of each Holder
of an outstanding Note affected, no such supplemental indenture shall:

      (a)   reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment or waiver;

      (b)   reduce the rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Notes;

      (c)   reduce the principal of or extend the Maturity Date of any Notes;

      (d)   make any change that adversely affects the conversion rights of any Notes;

      (e) reduce the Repurchase Price payable on the Repurchase Date, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price or the Redemption Price of any
Note or amend or modify in any manner adverse to the Holders the Company’s obligation to make such payments, whether through an amendment or
waiver of provisions in the covenants, definitions or otherwise;

      (f)   make any Note payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars;

      (g)   change the ranking of the Notes;

       (h) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal and interest on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to
institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Note;

      (i)   change the Company’s obligation to pay Additional Amounts on any Note; or

      (j)   make any change in this Article 10 that requires each Holder’s consent or in the waiver provisions in Section 6.02 or Section 6.09.

                                                                            61
      Upon the written request of the Company, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Holders as aforesaid and subject to
Section 10.05, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless (i) the Trustee has not received an
Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel that such supplemental indenture is authorized and permitted by the terms of this Indenture and not
contrary to law or (ii) such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which
case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.

      Holders do not need under this Section 10.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture. It shall be sufficient if such
Holders approve the substance thereof. After any supplemental indenture becomes effective under Section 10.01 or Section 10.02, the Company shall
mail to the Holders a notice briefly describing such supplemental indenture. However, the failure to give such notice to all the Holders, or any defect in
the notice, will not impair or affect the validity of the supplemental indenture.

       Section 10.03 Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article
10, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitation of rights,
obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders shall thereafter be determined, exercised and
enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture
shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.

      Section 10.04 Notation on Notes. Notes authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 10 may, at the Company’s expense, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such
supplemental indenture. If the Company or the Trustee shall so determine, new Notes so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the
Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may, at the Company’s expense, be prepared and
executed by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order and delivered in exchange for the Notes then outstanding,
upon surrender of such Notes then outstanding.

      Section 10.05 Evidence of Compliance of Supplemental Indenture to Be Furnished Trustee. In addition to the documents required by
Section 17.06, the Trustee shall receive an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture
executed pursuant hereto complies with the requirements of this Article 10 and is permitted or authorized by this Indenture and is not contrary to law.

                                                                            62

                                         CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE, CONVEYANCE AND LEASE

      Section 11.01 Company May Consolidate, Etc. on Certain Terms. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.02, the Company shall not consolidate
with, merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
Consolidated Affiliated Entities, taken as a whole, to another Person, unless:

      (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”), if not the Company, shall be a corporation organized and existing
under the laws of the United States, any State thereof, the District of Columbia, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda or Hong Kong
and the Successor Company (if not the Company) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture all of the obligations of the Company under the
Notes and this Indenture (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 4.07);

      (b) if the Company will not be the resulting or surviving corporation, the Company shall have, at or prior to the effective date of such
transaction, delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the execution and delivery of the supplemental
indenture do not conflict with the requirements set forth in the Indenture and that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of such
supplemental indenture have been satisfied; and

      (c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under this
Indenture.

       For purposes of this Section 11.01, the sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of one or more Subsidiaries or
Consolidated Affiliated Entities of the Company to another Person, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries or
Consolidated Affiliated Entities, would constitute all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the
sale, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company to another Person.

        Section 11.02 Successor Corporation to Be Substituted. In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease and upon
the assumption by the Successor Company, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of
the due and punctual payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Additional Amounts), the due and punctual delivery or payment, as the case may be, of any consideration due upon conversion of the Notes (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Amounts) and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be
performed by the Company, such Successor Company (if not the Company) shall succeed to and, except in the case of a lease of all or substantially all
of the Company’s properties and assets, shall be substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the party of the first
part. Such Successor Company thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company any or all of the
Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such
Successor Company instead of the Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall
authenticate and shall deliver, or cause to be authenticated and delivered, any Notes that previously shall have been signed and delivered by the Officers
of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Notes that such Successor Company thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the
Trustee for that purpose. All the Notes so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Notes theretofore or
thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Notes had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In the
event of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or transfer (but not in the case of a lease), upon compliance with this Article 11 the Person
named as the “Company” in the first paragraph of this Indenture (or any successor that shall thereafter have become such in the manner prescribed in
this Article 11) may be dissolved, wound up and liquidated at any time thereafter and, except in the case of a lease, such Person shall be released from
its liabilities as obligor and maker of the Notes and from its obligations under this Indenture and the Notes.

                                                                             63
     In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be
made in the Notes thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.

      Section 11.03 Opinion of Counsel to Be Given to Trustee. No consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease shall be effective unless
the Trustee shall receive an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale,
conveyance, transfer or lease and any such assumption and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such
supplemental indenture, complies with the provisions of this Article 11, that all conditions precedent thereto have been satisfied and that the Notes and
such supplemental indenture are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Successor Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
subject to customary assumptions, qualifications, and exceptions.

                              IMMUNITY OF INCORPORATORS, STOCKHOLDERS, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

       Section 12.01 Indenture and Notes Solely Corporate Obligations. No recourse for the payment of the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest
on any Note, nor for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of
the Company in this Indenture or in any supplemental indenture or in any Note, nor because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby,
shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, employee, agent, Officer or director or Subsidiary, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or
of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule
of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that all such liability is hereby expressly waived
and released as a condition of, and as a consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue of the Notes.

                                                                            64

                                                               CONVERSION OF NOTES

       Section 14.01 Conversion Privilege. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 14, each Holder of a Note shall have the
right, at such Holder’s option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is US$1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof)
of such Note at any time prior to the close of business on the fifth Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, at an initial
conversion rate of 10.6419 ADSs (subject to adjustment as provided in this Article 14, the “Conversion Rate”) per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes
(subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of Section 14.02, the “Conversion Obligation”).

       Section 14.02 Conversion Procedure; Settlement Upon Conversion. (a) Subject to this Section 14.02, Section 14.03(b) and Section 14.07(a),
upon conversion of any Note, the Company shall satisfy its Conversion Obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, to the converting Holder,
in respect of each US$1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted, cash (“Cash Settlement”), ADSs, together with cash, if applicable, in lieu of
delivering any fractional ADS in accordance with subsection 0 of this Section 14.02(“Physical Settlement”) or a combination of cash and ADSs,
together with cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional ADS in accordance with subsection 0 of this Section 14.02 (“Combination
Settlement”), at its election, as set forth in this Section 14.02.
            (i) All conversions for which the relevant Conversion Date occurs after the Company’s issuance of a Redemption Notice with respect to
      the Notes and prior to the close of business on the second Business Day prior to, the related Redemption Date, and all conversions for which the
      relevant Conversion Date occurs on or after the 46th Scheduled Trading Day before the Maturity Date shall be settled using the same Settlement
      Method.
            (ii) Except for any conversions for which the relevant Conversion Date occurs after the Company’s issuance of a Redemption Notice with
      respect to the Notes but prior to the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the related Redemption Date, and any conversions for
      which the relevant Conversion Date occurs on or after the 46th Scheduled Trading Day before the Maturity Date, the Company shall use the same
      Settlement Method for all conversions with the same Conversion Date, but the Company shall not have any obligation to use the same Settlement
      Method with respect to conversions with different Conversion Dates.

                                                                            65
       (iii) If, in respect of any Conversion Date (or the period described in the third immediately succeeding set of parentheses, as the case may
be), the Company elects a Settlement Method, the Company shall deliver a written notice (the “Settlement Notice”) of the relevant Settlement
Method in respect of such Conversion Date (or such period, as the case may be) to converting Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if
other than the Trustee) no later than the close of business on the Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date (or, in the case
of any conversions for which the relevant Conversion Date occurs (A) during the Redemption Period, in such Redemption Notice or (B) on or
after the 46th Scheduled Trading Day before the Maturity Date, no later than the 46th Scheduled Trading Day before the Maturity Date). If the
Company does not elect a Settlement Method prior to the deadline set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall no longer
have the right to elect Cash Settlement or Physical Settlement for such conversion or during such period and the Company shall be deemed to
have elected Combination Settlement in respect of its Conversion Obligation, and the Specified Dollar Amount per US$1,000 principal amount of
Notes shall be equal to US$1,000 (such settlement method, the “Default Settlement Method”). Such Settlement Notice shall specify the relevant
Settlement Method and in the case of an election of Combination Settlement, the relevant Settlement Notice shall indicate the Specified Dollar
Amount per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes. If the Company delivers a Settlement Notice electing Combination Settlement in respect of its
Conversion Obligation but does not indicate a Specified Dollar Amount per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes in such Settlement Notice, the
Specified Dollar Amount per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be deemed to be US$1,000.
      (iv) By written notice to the Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee), the Company may, prior to the 46th
Scheduled Trading Day before the Maturity Date, at its option, change the Default Settlement Method to any Settlement Method that the Company
is then permitted to elect or irrevocably elect to satisfy its Conversion Obligation with respect to the Notes through any Settlement Method that the
Company is then permitted to elect, including Combination Settlement with a Specified Dollar Amount per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes
of US$1,000 or with an ability to continue to set the Specified Dollar Amount per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes at or above a specific
amount set forth in such election notice. If the Company changes the Default Settlement Method or the Company irrevocably elects to fix the
Settlement Method, in either case, to Combination Settlement with an ability to continue to set the Specified Dollar Amount per US$1,000
principal amount of Notes at or above a specific amount, the Company will, after the date of such change or election, as the case may be, inform
Holders converting their Notes through the Trustee, the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing of such Specified Dollar Amount
in respect of the relevant conversion or conversions no later than the relevant deadline for election of a specified Settlement Method as set forth in
the immediately preceding paragraph, or, if the Company does not timely notify Holders, the Trustee, and the Conversion Agent (if other than the
Trustee) of the Specified Dollar Amount, such Specified Dollar Amount will be the specific amount set forth in the change or election notice or, if
no specific amount was set forth in the change or election notice, such Specified Dollar Amount will be US$1,000 per US$1,000 principal amount
of Notes. A change in the Default Settlement Method or an irrevocable election shall apply for all conversions of Notes with Conversion Dates
occurring subsequent to delivery of such notice; provided that no such change or election will affect any Settlement Method theretofore elected (or
deemed to be elected) with respect to any Note. For the avoidance of doubt, such an irrevocable election, if made by the Company, will be
effective without the need to amend this Indenture or the Notes, including pursuant to Section 10.01. However, the Company may nonetheless
choose to execute such an amendment at its option. Concurrently with providing notice to all Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if
other than the Trustee) of an election to change the Default Settlement Method or irrevocably fixes the Settlement Method, the Company shall
either post the Default Settlement Method or fixed Settlement Method, as applicable, on the Company’s website or disclose the same in a current
report on Form 6-K (or any successor form) that is filed with the Commission.

                                                                      66
      (v) The cash, ADSs or a combination of cash and ADSs, as applicable, in respect of any conversion of Notes (the “Settlement Amount”)
shall be computed as follows:
             (A) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by Physical Settlement, the Company
       shall deliver to the converting Holder in respect of each US$1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted a number of ADSs equal to
       the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the relevant Conversion Date;
             (B) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by Cash Settlement, the Company
       shall pay to the converting Holder in respect of each US$1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted cash in an amount equal to the
       sum of the Daily Conversion Values for each of the 40 consecutive Trading Days during the related Observation Period; and
             (C) if the Company elects (or is deemed to have elected) to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by
       Combination Settlement, the Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, to the converting Holder in respect of each US$1,000
       principal amount of Notes being converted, a Settlement Amount equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 40
       consecutive Trading Days during the related Observation Period.
      (vi) The Daily Settlement Amounts (if applicable) and the Daily Conversion Values (if applicable) shall be determined by the Company
promptly following the last day of the Observation Period. Promptly after such determination of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily
Conversion Values, as the case may be, and the amount of cash payable in lieu of delivering any fractional ADS, the Company shall notify the
Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the
case may be, and the amount of cash payable in lieu of delivering any fractional ADS. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the
Trustee) shall have no responsibility for any such determination.

                                                                    67
             (vii) The Holders may elect to receive Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion by specifying in the relevant
      Notice of Conversion such election. If a Holder elects to receive Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion, the Company
      shall register in the Hong Kong Share Register the Person or Persons designated in the Notice of Conversion as holder of such number of Ordinary
      Shares equal to (i) the number of ADSs deliverable upon conversion as described above under the “Settlement Amounts” (without taking into
      account any fractional ADS) multiplied by (ii) the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS as of the Conversion Date (in the case
      of Physical Settlement) or the last Trading Day of the relevant Observation Period (in the case of Combination Settlement). If the Holder has
      requested in the Notice of Conversion, to the extent permitted under applicable law and the rules and procedures of CCASS, the Company shall
      take all necessary action to enable the Ordinary Shares to be delivered to such Holder’s designated Hong Kong stock account in CCASS for so
      long as the Ordinary Shares are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; provided that, if such Holder elects in the Notice of Conversion to
      receive Ordinary Shares outside of CCASS or if the restrictive legend on the Notes has not been removed prior to the Conversion Date, the
      Company shall make share certificate or certificates representing such number of Ordinary Shares available for collection at the office of the Hong
      Kong Share Registrar or, if so requested in the relevant Notice of Conversion, cause the Hong Kong Share Registrar to mail (at the risk, and, if
      sent at the Holder’s request otherwise than by ordinary mail, at the expense, of the Person to whom such certificate or certificates are sent) such
      certificate or certificates to the Person and at the place specified in the Notice of Conversion.
             (viii) Any Ordinary shares deliverable in lieu of any ADSs will be, prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date, subject to certain
      transfer restrictions as set forth in Section 2.05(d) and will not be able to be deposited into CCASS until such restrictions are removed. After
      removal of such restrictions on transfer and resale, any Ordinary Shares deliverable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, will be fully fungible
      with the Ordinary Shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company further covenants that it will obtain approval to list, subject to
      official notice of issuance upon conversion of the Notes, such Ordinary Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and register in the Hong Kong
      Share Register in the Person or Persons designated in the Notice of Conversion as the holder of the Ordinary Shares in order to facilitate their
      listing and trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

       (b) Subject to Section 14.02(e), before any Holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert a Note as set forth above, such Holder shall (i) in the
case of a Global Note, comply with the applicable procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and the procedures agreed by the Company and the
ADS Depositary with respect to any ADSs issued upon conversion of the Notes (including submission of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and
the ADS Depositary for any conversion prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date), if applicable, and, if required, pay funds equal to interest
payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 14.02(h), and/or all transfer or similar taxes as
described herein and (ii) in the case of a Physical Note (1) complete, manually sign and deliver a duly completed irrevocable notice to the Conversion
Agent, the Company and the ADS Depositary as set forth in the Form of Notice of Conversion (or a facsimile, PDF or other electronic transmission
thereof) (a “Notice of Conversion”) at the specified office of the Conversion Agent and state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be
converted, including, if applicable, the Holder’s election to receive Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADS deliverable upon conversion and, if the Holder
prefers to receive the Ordinary Shares through CCASS after the restricted legend on the Notes has been removed, its Hong Kong stock account in
CCASS, and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any ADSs or Ordinary Shares to be
delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (2) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and
accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the specified office of the Trustee (3) if required, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents (4) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not
entitled as set forth in Section 14.02(h); and (5) if required, pay any transfer or similar taxes as set forth herein. The Trustee (and if different, the
Conversion Agent) shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 14 on the Conversion Date for such conversion. No Notice of
Conversion with respect to any Notes may be delivered and no Notes may be surrendered by a Holder for conversion thereof if such Holder has also
delivered a Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of such Notes and has not validly withdrawn such
Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 15.03. A Notice of Conversion shall be deposited at the
office of any Conversion Agent on any Business Day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the location of the Conversion Agent to which such Notice of
Conversion is delivered. Any Notice of Conversion and any Physical Note (if issued) deposited outside the hours specified or on a day that is not a
Business Day at the location of the Conversion Agent shall for all purposes be deemed to have been deposited with that Conversion Agent between 9:00
a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on the next Business Day.

                                                                           68
       If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes
shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so
surrendered. None of the Agents of the Trustee shall have any responsibility whatsoever with respect to the issuance and delivery of the ADSs to the
converting Holder.

       (c) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the “Conversion Date”) that the
Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in subsection (b) above. Except as set forth in Section 14.03(b) andSection 14.07(a), the Company
shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, the consideration due in respect of the Conversion Obligation on the third Business Day immediately following
the relevant Conversion Date, if the Company elects Physical Settlement, or on the third Business Day immediately following the last Trading Day of
the relevant Observation Period, in the case of any other Settlement Method, provided that, if such Conversion Date occurs (i) following 46th Scheduled
Trading Day immediately before the Maturity Date, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company shall make such payment or delivery on the Maturity
Date; or (ii) after the Ordinary Shares have been replaced by the Reference Property consisting solely of cash in accordance with Section 14.07, the
Company shall cause the Conversion Obligation due in respect of the conversion on the earlier of (x) tenth Business Day immediately following the
related Conversion Date and (y) the Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if a Holder elects to receive Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs
deliverable upon conversion, the Company shall deliver the Ordinary Shares due in respect of conversion on the fifth Business Day immediately
following the relevant Conversion Date (in the case of Physical Settlement) or on the fifth Business Day immediately following the last Trading Day of
the relevant Observation Period (in the case of Combination Settlement). If any ADS are due to a converting Holder, the Company shall issue and
deliver (if applicable) (or cause the Conversion Agent to issue and deliver (if applicable)) to such Holder, or such Holder’s nominee or nominees, the
full number of ADSs to which such Holder shall be entitled, in book-entry format through the Depositary, in satisfaction of the Company’s Conversion
Obligation.

                                                                          69
       (d) In case any certificated Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and instruct the Trustee who shall
authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Note so surrendered a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note, without payment of any service charge by the converting Holder
but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge required by law or
that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such conversion being different from
the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such conversion.

       (e) If a Holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp, issue, transfer or similar tax due on the delivery
of the ADSs upon conversion of the Notes (or the issuance of the Ordinary Shares underlying, or in lieu of, such ADSs), unless the tax is due because
the Holder requests such ADSs (or the Ordinary Shares) to be issued in a name other than the Holder’s name, in which case the Holder shall pay that
tax. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the ADSs (or the Ordinary Shares) being issued in a name other than the
Holder’s name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that is due by such Holder in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. The Company shall pay the ADS Depositary’s fees for issuance of the ADSs. The Company shall also pay all other expenses arising from the
issue and listing of the Ordinary Shares to be delivered in lieu of ADSs upon conversion the offering of the Notes and all the charges of the Hong Kong
Share Registrar in connection with the offering of the Notes.

      (f) Except as provided in Section 14.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any ADSs delivered upon the conversion of any Note as
provided in this Article 14.

      (g) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on
such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of
Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.

       (h) Upon conversion, a Holder shall not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest, if any, except as set forth below.
The Company’s settlement of the Conversion Obligation shall be deemed to satisfy in full its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the relevant Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the relevant Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Upon a conversion of Notes
into a combination of cash and ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof), accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid first out of the cash
paid upon such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date and prior to the
open of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date, Holders of such Notes at the close of business on such Regular Record Date will receive
the full amount of interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for
conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the open of business on the immediately following Interest
Payment Date must be accompanied by an amount in U.S. dollars equal to the amount of interest payable on the Notes so converted; provided that no
such payment shall be required (1) for conversions following the close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity
Date; (2) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately
succeeding the corresponding Interest Payment Date; (3) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular
Record Date and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately succeeding the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (4) to the extent of any
Defaulted Amounts, if any Defaulted Amounts exist at the time of conversion with respect to such Note. Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, all
Holders as of close of Business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date, any Fundamental Change Repurchase Date or
Redemption Date, in each case, shall receive the full amount of interest payable on the Maturity Date or other applicable Interest Payment Date in cash,
regardless of whether their Notes have been converted following such Regular Record Date.

                                                                           70
       (i) The Person in whose name any ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) delivered upon conversion shall be entitled to participate in any
distribution or other transaction relating to the ADSs (or Ordinary Shares) as though such Person were the holder of record of such ADSs (or Ordinary
Shares) as of the close of business on the relevant Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy the related Conversion Obligation by Physical
Settlement) or the last Trading Day of the relevant Observation Period (if the Company elects to satisfy the related Conversion Obligation by
Combination Settlement). Upon a conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes surrendered for conversion.

       (j) Regardless of whether a Holder elects to receive Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion, the Company shall not
issue any fractional ADS upon conversion of the Notes and shall instead pay cash in lieu of delivering any fractional ADS issuable upon conversion
based on the Daily VWAP for the relevant Conversion Date (in the case of Physical Settlement) or based on the Daily VWAP for the last Trading Day of
the relevant Observation Period (in the case of Combination Settlement). For each Note surrendered for conversion, if the Company has elected (or is
deemed to have elected) Combination Settlement, the full number of ADSs that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis
of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the relevant Observation Period and any fractional ADS remaining after such computation shall be paid
in cash.

      (k) In accordance with the Unrestricted Deposit Agreement or the Restricted Deposit Agreement, as applicable, and the Procedures Letter, the
Company shall issue to the ADS Custodian such Ordinary Shares required for the issuance of the ADSs upon conversion of the Notes, plus written
delivery instructions (if requested by the ADS Depositary or the ADS Custodian) for such ADSs, shall deliver such legal opinions and any other
information or documentation and shall comply with the Unrestricted Deposit Agreement and the Restricted Deposit Agreement (as the case may be)
and the Procedures Letter, in each case, as required by the ADS Depositary or the ADS Custodian in connection with each issue of Ordinary Shares and
issuance and delivery of ADSs.

                                                                          71
       Section 14.03 Increased Conversion Rate Applicable to Certain Notes Surrendered in Connection with Make-Whole Fundamental Changes.
(a) If a Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs prior to the Maturity Date and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-
Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall, under the circumstances described below, increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered
for conversion by a number of additional ADSs (the “Additional ADSs”), as described below. A conversion of Notes shall be deemed for these
purposes to be “in connection with” such Make-Whole Fundamental Change if the relevant Notice of Conversion is received by the Conversion Agent
from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change up to, and including, the second Business Day immediately prior to the
related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (or, in the case of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that would have been a Fundamental Change but
for the proviso in clause (b) of the definition thereof, the 35th Trading Day immediately following the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental
Change). The Company shall provide written notification to Holders and the Trustee (and the Conversion Agent, if other than the Trustee) of the
Effective Date of any Make-Whole Fundamental Change and issue a press release announcing such Effective Date no later than five Business Days after
such Effective Date.

        (b) Upon surrender of Notes for conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall, at its option, satisfy its
Conversion Obligation by Physical Settlement, Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement, in accordance with Section 14.02; provided, however, that
if, at the effective time of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Reference Property
following such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is composed entirely of cash, for any conversion of Notes following the Effective Date of such
Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Conversion Obligation shall be calculated based solely on the ADS Price for the transaction and shall be deemed
to be an amount of cash per US$1,000 principal amount of converted Notes equal to the Conversion Rate (including any adjustment for Additional
ADSs), multiplied by such ADS Price. In such event, the Conversion Obligation will be determined and paid to Holders in cash on the third Business
Day following the Conversion Date.

      (c) The number of Additional ADSs, if any, by which the Conversion Rate shall be increased shall be determined by reference to the table
below, based on the date on which the Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the “Effective Date”) and the price (the “ADS
Price”) paid (or deemed to be paid) per ADS in the Make-Whole Fundamental Change. If the holders of the ADSs receive in exchange for their ADSs
only cash in a Make- Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the ADS Price shall be the cash
amount paid per ADS. Otherwise, the ADS Price shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the ADSs over the five Trading Day period
ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of the Make- Whole Fundamental Change.

       (d) The ADS Prices set forth in the column headings of the table below shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the
Notes is otherwise adjusted. The adjusted ADS Prices shall equal the ADS Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment giving rise to the ADS Price adjustment and the
denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional ADSs set forth in the table below shall be adjusted in the same
manner and at the same time as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 14.04.

                                                                         72
      (e) The following table sets forth the number of Additional ADSs to be received per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes pursuant to this
Section 14.03 for each ADS Price and Effective Date set forth below:

                                                                               ADS Price
Effective Date      US$67.12 US$75.00 US$80.00 US$85.00 US$90.00 US$93.97 US$100.00 US$110.00 US$122.16 US$130.00 US$150.00 US$200.00 US$500.00

       The exact ADS Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:

             (i) if the ADS Price is between two ADS Prices in the table above or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the
       number of Additional ADSs shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional ADSs set forth for the higher
       and lower ADS Prices and the earlier and later Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;

            (ii) if the ADS Price is greater than US$500.00 per ADS (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the ADS Prices set forth in the
       column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional ADSs shall be added to the Conversion Rate; and

            (iii) if the ADS Price is less than US$67.12 per ADS (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the ADS Prices set forth in the column
       headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional ADSs shall be added to the Conversion Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Conversion Rate per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes exceed 14.8986 ADSs, subject to
adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.04.

       (f)   Nothing in this Section 14.03 shall prevent an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.04.

       (g) If the Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with a Tax Redemption, an Optional Redemption or a Cleanup Redemption pursuant
to Article 16, the Conversion Rate shall be increased by a number of Additional ADSs determined pursuant to this Section 14.03(g). The Company shall
settle conversions of Notes as described in Section 14.02 and, for the avoidance of doubt, pay Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to any such
conversion.

                                                                            73
       A conversion shall be deemed to be “in connection with” an Optional Redemption, a Cleanup Redemption or a Tax Redemption if the relevant
Notice of Conversion is received by the Conversion Agent during the relevant Redemption Period. In the event that a conversion of the Notes called for
redemption in connection with an Optional Redemption, a Cleanup Redemption or a Tax Redemption pursuant to Article 16 would also be deemed to be
in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, a Holder of the Notes to be converted shall be entitled to a single increase to the Conversion
Rate with respect to the first to occur of the applicable Redemption Notice or the Effective Date of the applicable Make-Whole Fundamental Change,
and the later event shall be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of this Section 14.03(g) and the adjustments described under Section 14.03(a). For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Company issues a Redemption Notice as set forth under Article 16, the Company shall increase the Conversion Rate
hereunder during the related Redemption Period only with respect to conversions of Notes called for redemption (or deemed to be called for
redemption). Accordingly, if the Company elects fewer than all of the outstanding Notes as described under Article 16, Holders will not be entitled to
convert the Notes that are neither called for redemption nor deemed to be called for redemption on account of the Redemption Notice and will not be
entitled to an increased Conversion Rate for conversions of such Notes on account of the Redemption Notice during the related Redemption Period,
even if such Notes are otherwise convertible.

       The number of Additional ADSs by which the Conversion Rate will be increased in the event of conversion of Notes called for redemption in
connection with an Optional Redemption, a Cleanup Redemption or a Tax Redemption pursuant to Article 16 will be determined by reference to the
table in clause (e) above based on the Redemption Reference Date and the Redemption Reference Price (each as defined below), but determined for
purposes of this Section 14.03(g) as if (x) the Holder had elected to convert its Notes in connection with a Make- Whole Fundamental Change, (y) the
applicable “Redemption Reference Date” were the “Effective Date” as specified in clause (c) above and (z) the applicable “Redemption Reference
Price” were the “ADS Price” as specified in clause (c) above (and subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the two paragraphs immediately following such
table). For this purpose, the date on which the Company delivers a Redemption Notice is the “Redemption Reference Date” and the average of the Last
Reported Sale Prices of the ADSs over the five Trading Day period immediately preceding the date the Company delivers such Redemption Notice is
the “Redemption Reference Price.”

      Section 14.04 Adjustment of Conversion Rate. If the number of Ordinary Shares represented by the ADSs is changed, after the date of this
Indenture, for any reason other than one or more of the events described in this Section 14.04, the Company shall make an appropriate adjustment to the
Conversion Rate such that the number of Ordinary Shares represented by the ADSs upon which conversion of the Notes is based remains the same.

                                                                          74
       Notwithstanding the adjustment provisions described in this Section 14.04, if the Company distributes to holders of the Ordinary Shares any cash,
rights, options, warrants, shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interest, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company (but
excluding Expiring Rights) and a corresponding distribution is not made to holders of the ADSs, but, instead, the ADSs shall represent, in addition to
Ordinary Shares, such cash, rights, options, warrants, shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interest, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or
property of the Company, then an adjustment to the Conversion Rate described in this Section 14.04 shall not be made until and unless a corresponding
distribution (if any) is made to holders of the ADSs, and such adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be based on the distribution made to the holders
of the ADSs and not on the distribution made to the holders of the Ordinary Shares. However, in the event that the Company issues or distributes to all
holders of the Ordinary Shares any Expiring Rights, notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall adjust the Conversion Rate
pursuant to Section 14.04(b) (in the case of Expiring Rights entitling holders of the Ordinary Shares for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after
the announcement date of such issuance to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares or ADSs) or Section 14.04(c) (in the case of all other Expiring
Rights).

      Notwithstanding any provision herein, if any event described in this Section 14.04 results in a change to the number of Ordinary Shares
represented by the ADSs, then such a change shall be deemed to satisfy the Company’s obligation to effect the relevant adjustment to the Conversion
Rate on account of such an event to the extent such change reflects what a corresponding change to the Conversion Rate would have been on account of
such event.

      The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company if any of the following events occurs, except that the Company shall not
make any adjustments to the Conversion Rate if Holders of the Notes participate (other than in the case of (x) a share split or share combination or (y) a
tender or exchange offer), at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the ADSs and solely as a result of holding the Notes, in any of the
transactions described in this Section 14.04, without having to convert their Notes, as if they held a number of ADSs equal to the Conversion Rate,
multiplied by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall have any
responsibility to monitor the accuracy of any calculation of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate and the same shall be conclusive and binding on the
Holders, absent manifest error. Notice of such adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be given by the Company promptly to the Holders, the Trustee
and the Paying Agent and Conversion Agent and shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders, absent manifest error.

       (a) If the Company exclusively issues Ordinary Shares as a dividend or distribution on the Ordinary Shares, or if the Company effects a share
split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:




where,

CR0      =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the ADSs of such dividend or
               distribution, or immediately prior to the open of business on the Effective Date of such share split or share combination, as applicable;

                                                                            75
CR1      =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date or Effective Date, as applicable;
OS0      =     the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date or Effective Date, as
               applicable (before giving effect to any such dividend, distribution, split or combination); and
OS1      =     the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or share
               combination.

Any adjustment made under this Section 14.04(a) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the ADSs
for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the Effective Date for such share split or share combination, as applicable.
If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 14.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be
immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that
would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

      (b) If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) any rights (other than in
connection with a stockholders rights plan), options or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after the announcement
date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) at a price per Ordinary Share that is less than the
average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Ordinary Shares or the ADSs, as the case may be (divided by, in the case of the ADSs, the number of
Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS), for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:




where,

CR0      =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the ADSs for such issuance;
CR1      =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date;
OS0      =     the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date;

                                                                            76
X        =     the total number of Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) deliverable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; and
Y        =     the number of Ordinary Shares equal to (i) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, divided by (ii) the
               quotient of (a) the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the ADSs over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and
               including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of the issuance of such rights, options or warrants divided
               by (b) the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS.

Any increase made under this Section 14.04(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become
effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the ADSs for such issuance. To the extent that Ordinary Shares or ADSs
are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then
be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of
Ordinary Shares actually delivered (directly or in the form of ADSs). To the extent such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion
Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made on the basis of only the issuance, if any,
actually made.

       For purposes of this Section 14.04(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase
Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) at a price per Ordinary Share that is less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the
Ordinary Shares or the ADSs, as the case may be (divided by, in the case of the ADSs, the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS),
for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance,
and in determining the aggregate offering price of such Ordinary Shares or ADSs, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the
Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than
cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.

                                                                            77
       (c) If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property of the Company or rights,
options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of
ADSs), excluding (i) dividends, distributions or issuances as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 14.04(a) or Section 14.04(b),
(ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 14.04(d), and (iii) Spin-Offs as to
which the provisions set forth below in this Section 14.04(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets or
property or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities of the Company, the “Distributed Property”), then the Conversion
Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:




where,

CR0        =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
CR1        =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date;
SP0        =     the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the ADSs (divided by the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS)
                 over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date
                 for such distribution; and
FMV        =     the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the Distributed Property with respect to each outstanding Ordinary
                 Share (directly or in the form of ADSs) on the Ex-Dividend Date for the ADSs for such distribution.

Any increase made under the foregoing portion of this Section 14.04(c) above shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-
Dividend Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made at all or in full, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion
Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made on the basis of only such amount of such distribution, if any, actually paid or made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “FMV” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each
Holder of a Note shall receive, in respect of each US$1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the ADSs
receive the Distributed Property, the amount and kind of Distributed Property such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of ADSs
equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date for the ADSs for the distribution.

      With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 14.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Ordinary
Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other
business unit of the Company, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange (a “Spin-Off”), the
Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:




where,

CR0        =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the end of the Valuation Period;

                                                                              78
CR1       =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the end of the Valuation Period;
FMV0      =     the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of the Ordinary Shares
                (directly or in the form of ADSs) applicable to one Ordinary Share (determined by reference to the definition of Last Reported Sale
                Price as set forth in Section 1.01 as if references therein to the ADSs were to such Capital Stock or similar equity interest) over the first
                10 consecutive Trading Day period after, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date of the Spin-Off (the “Valuation Period”); and
MP0       =     the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the ADSs (divided by the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS)
                over the Valuation Period.

The increase to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall occur immediately after the close of business on the last Trading Day of the
Valuation Period; provided that (x) in respect of any conversion of Notes for which Physical Settlement is applicable, if the relevant Conversion Date
occurs during the Valuation Period, the reference in the portion of this Section 14.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to 10 consecutive Trading Days shall be
deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off to, and
including, the Conversion Date in determining the Conversion Rate and (y) in respect of any conversion of Notes for which Cash Settlement or
Combination Settlement is applicable, for any Trading Day that falls within the relevant Observation Period for such conversion and within the
Valuation Period, the reference in this Section 14.04(c) with respect to 10 consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser
number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off to, and including, such Trading Day in
determining the Conversion Rate as of such Trading Day. If the dividend or other distribution constituting the Spin-Off is not so paid or made, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors or a committee thereof determines not to make or pay such dividend
or other distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.

                                                                            79
        For purposes of this Section 14.04(c) (and subject in all respect to Section 14.11), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all
holders of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company’s Capital Stock,
including Ordinary Shares (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or
events (“Trigger Event”): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs); (ii) are not exercisable; and
(iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs), shall be deemed not to have been distributed
for purposes of this Section 14.04(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the
earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is
required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 14.04(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights,
options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants
become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event
shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the
existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in
the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the
immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or
purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights,
options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed
distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per Ordinary Share redemption or purchase price
received by a holder or holders of Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such
holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) as of the date of such
redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders
thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.

      For purposes of Section 14.04(a), Section 14.04(b) and this Section 14.04(c), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 14.04(c) is
applicable also includes one or both of:

      (A) a dividend or distribution of Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) to which Section 14.04(a) is applicable (the “Clause A
Distribution”); or

      (B)   a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 14.04(b) is applicable (the “Clause B Distribution”),

then (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or
distribution to which this Section 14.04(c) is applicable (the “Clause C Distribution”) and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this
Section 14.04(c) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be
deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 14.04(a) and Section 14.04(b) with
respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Company (I) the “Ex-Dividend Date” of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B
Distribution shall be deemed to be the Ex-Dividend Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs)
included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be “outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on such
Ex-Dividend Date or Effective Date” within the meaning of Section 14.04(a) or “outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on such Ex-
Dividend Date” within the meaning of Section 14.04(b).

                                                                            80
     (d) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs), the
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:




where,

CR0        =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the ADSs for such dividend or
                 distribution;
CR1        =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date;
SP0        =     the Last Reported Sale Price of the ADSs (divided by the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS) on the Trading
                 Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; and
C          =     the amount in cash per Ordinary Share the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in
                 the form of ADSs) (for the avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to any applicable fees and expenses payable to, or withheld by, the
                 ADS Depositary with respect to such distribution).

Any increase pursuant to this Section 14.04(d) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend
or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors
determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made on the
basis of only the dividend or distribution, if any, actually made or paid.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “C” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each
Holder of a Note shall receive, for each US$1,000 principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the ADSs, the
amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of ADSs equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for the
ADSs for such cash dividend or distribution.

                                                                           81
       (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Consolidated Affiliated Entities makes a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for
the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs), to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per
Ordinary Share exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the ADSs (divided by the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one
ADS) over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange
offer expires, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:




where,

CR0        =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including,
                 the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
CR1        =     the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including,
                 the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
AC         =     the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Board of Directors) paid or payable for Ordinary
                 Shares or ADSs, as the case may be, purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
OS0        =     the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires (prior to giving effect to
                 the purchase of all Ordinary Shares or ADSs, as the case may be, accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer);
OS1        =     the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to the
                 purchase of all Ordinary Shares or ADSs, as the case may be, accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); and
SP1        =     the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the ADSs (divided by the number of Ordinary Shares then represented by one ADS)
                 over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or
                 exchange offer expires.

The increase to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(e) shall occur immediately after the close of business on the 10th Trading Day
immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires; provided that (x) in respect of
any conversion of Notes for which Physical Settlement is applicable, if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during the 10 Trading Days immediately
following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references in this Section 14.04(e) with
respect to 10th Trading Day or 10 consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from,
and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the expiration date of such tender or exchange offer to, and including, the Conversion Date in
determining the Conversion Rate and (y) in respect of any conversion of Notes for which Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement is applicable, for
any Trading Day that falls within the relevant Observation Period for such conversion and within the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and
including, the Trading Day next succeeding the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references in this Section 14.04(e) with respect to 10th
Trading Day or 10 consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including,
the Trading Day next succeeding the expiration date of such tender or exchange offer to, and including, such Trading Day in determining the Conversion
Rate as of such Trading Day.

                                                                           82
      To the extent such tender or exchange offer is announced but not consummated (including as a result of being precluded from consummating such
tender or exchange offer under applicable law), or any purchases or exchanges of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs) in such tender or
exchange offer are rescinded, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made
on the basis of only the purchases or exchanges of the Ordinary Shares (directly or in the form of ADSs), if any, actually made, and not rescinded, in
such tender or exchange offer.

      (f) Notwithstanding foregoing, if a Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective on any Ex-Dividend Date as described above, and a Holder
that has converted its Notes on or after such Ex-Dividend Date and on or prior to the related Record Date would be treated as the record holder of ADSs
(or Ordinary Shares if such Holder elects to receive Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion) as of the related Conversion Date
as described under Section 14.02(i) based on an adjusted Conversion Rate for such Ex-Dividend Date, then, notwithstanding the Conversion Rate
adjustment provisions in this Section 14.04, the Conversion Rate adjustment relating to such Ex-Dividend Date shall not be made for such converting
Holder. Instead, such Holder shall be treated as if such Holder were the record owner of the ADSs (or Ordinary Shares if such Holder elects to receive
Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion) on an unadjusted basis and participate in the related dividend, distribution or other
event giving rise to such adjustment.

      (g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of Ordinary Shares or ADSs or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Ordinary Shares or ADSs or the right to purchase Ordinary Shares or ADSs or such convertible or exchangeable
securities.

      (h) In addition to those adjustments required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 14.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable
law and subject to the applicable rules of The NASDAQ Global Select Market and any other securities exchange on which any of the Company’s
securities are then listed, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if
the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company’s best interest, and the Company may (but is not required to) increase the
Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Ordinary Shares or the ADSs or rights to purchase Ordinary Shares or ADSs in
connection with a dividend or distribution of Ordinary Shares or ADSs (or rights to acquire Ordinary Shares or ADSs) or similar event.

      (i)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 14, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
            (i) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares or ADSs pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends
      or interest payable on the Company’s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in Ordinary Shares or ADSs under any plan;

                                                                            83
           (ii) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares or ADSs or options or rights to purchase those Ordinary Shares or ADSs pursuant to any
      present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or
      Consolidated Affiliated Entities;
            (iii) upon the issuance of any Ordinary Shares or ADSs pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible
      security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
            (iv) upon the repurchase of any Ordinary Shares or ADSs pursuant to an open market share purchase program or other buy-back
      transaction, including derivative transactions or other buy-back transaction, that is not a tender offer or exchange offer of the kind described under
      Section 14.04(e) above;
            (v)    solely for a change in the par value of the Ordinary Shares; or
            (vi)   for accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 14, the Company shall not be required to adjust the Conversion Rate unless such
adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be
made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided, further, that any such adjustment of less than one
percent that has not been made shall be made upon the occurrence of (i) the Effective Date for any Fundamental Change or Make-Whole Fundamental
Change, (ii) the Conversion Date of, or any Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period for any Note and (iii) every one year anniversary of the
first date of original issuance of the Notes. In addition, the Company shall not account for such deferrals when determining what number of shares of
ADSs (or Ordinary Shares) a Holder would have held on a given day had it converted its Notes.

      (j) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 14 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten
thousandth (1/10,000th) of an ADS.

       (k) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee (and the Conversion Agent
if not the Trustee) an Officers’ Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts
requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers’ Certificate, the Trustee shall not be
deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has
knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate
setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the
Conversion Rate to each Holder at its last address appearing on the Note Register of this Indenture. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the
legality or validity of any such adjustment.

                                                                             84
      (l) For purposes of this Section 14.04, the number of Ordinary Shares at any time outstanding shall not include Ordinary Shares held in the
treasury of the Company (directly or in the form of ADSs) so long as the Company does not pay any dividend or make any distribution on Ordinary
Shares held in the treasury of the Company (directly or in the form of ADSs), but shall include Ordinary Shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates
issued in lieu of fractions of Ordinary Shares.

      Section 14.05 Adjustments of Prices. Whenever any provision of this Indenture requires the Company to calculate the Last Reported Sale
Prices, the Daily VWAPs, the Daily Conversion Values, the Daily Settlement Amounts or the ADS Price for purposes of a Make- Whole Fundamental
Change or the Redemption Reference Price for purposes of an Optional Redemption, a Cleanup Redemption, or a Tax Redemption pursuant to Article
16 over a span of multiple days, the Board of Directors shall make appropriate adjustments in good faith to each to account for any adjustment to the
Conversion Rate that becomes effective pursuant to Section 14.04, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 14.04 where the Record Date, Ex-Dividend Date, Effective Date or expiration date, as the case may be, of the event occurs, at any time during
the period when such Last Reported Sale Prices, the Daily VWAPs, the Daily Conversion Values, the Daily Settlement Amounts, ADS Prices or
Redemption Reference Price are to be calculated.

     Section 14.06 Ordinary Shares to Be Fully Paid. The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued
Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Shares held in treasury, a sufficient number of Ordinary Shares that corresponds to the number of ADSs due upon
conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion (assuming that at the time of computation of such number of
Ordinary Shares, all such Notes would be converted by a single Holder and that Physical Settlement were applicable).

      Section 14.07    Effect of Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of the Ordinary Shares. (a) In the case of:
          (i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the ADSs or the Ordinary Shares (other than changes resulting from a subdivision or
      combination),
            (ii)   any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction involving the Company,
           (iii) any sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries and
      Consolidated Affiliated Entities substantially as an entirety or
            (iv)   any statutory share exchange,

                                                                            85
in each case, as a result of which the ADSs or the Ordinary Shares would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or
assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (any such event, a “Merger Event”), then, prior to or at the effective time of such Merger Event, the
Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture permitted under
Section 10.01(f) providing that, at and after the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each US$1,000 principal amount of Notes shall
be changed into a right to convert such principal amount of Notes into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets
(including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of ADSs equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such Merger Event
would have owned or been entitled to receive (the “Reference Property,” with each “unit of Reference Property” meaning the kind and amount of
Reference Property that a holder of one ADS would be entitled to receive) upon such Merger Event; provided, however, that at and after the effective
time of the Merger Event (i) the Company shall continue to have the right to determine the form of consideration to be paid or delivered, as the case may
be, upon conversion of Notes in accordance with Section 14.02 and (ii)(x) any amount payable in cash upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with
Section 14.02 shall continue to be payable in cash, (y) any ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) that the Company would have been required to
deliver upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with Section 14.02 shall instead be deliverable in the amount and type of Reference Property that a
holder of that number of ADSs would have been entitled to receive in such Merger Event and (z) the Daily VWAP shall be calculated based on the value
of a unit of Reference Property that a holder of one ADS would have received in such Merger Event.

       If the Merger Event causes the ADSs or the Ordinary Shares to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of
consideration (determined based in part upon any form of holder election), then (i) the Reference Property into which the Notes will be convertible shall
be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration actually received by the holders of the ADSs and (ii) the unit of
Reference Property for purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph shall refer to the consideration referred to in clause (i) attributable to one ADS.
If the holders of the ADSs or Ordinary Shares receive only cash in such Merger Event, then for all conversions for which the relevant Conversion Date
occurs after the effective date of such Merger Event (A) the consideration due upon conversion of each US$1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be
solely cash in an amount equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date (as may be increased by any Additional ADSs pursuant to
Section 14.03), multiplied by the price paid per ADS or Ordinary Share, as applicable, in such Merger Event and (B) the Company shall satisfy the
Conversion Obligation by paying cash to converting Holders on the third Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date. The
Company shall provide written notice to Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) of such weighted average as soon as
practicable after such determination is made.

       Such supplemental indenture described in the second immediately preceding paragraph shall provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments that
shall be as nearly equivalent as is practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 14 (it being understood that no such adjustments shall be
required with respect to any portion of the Reference Property that does not consist of shares of Common Equity (however evidenced) or depositary
receipts in respect thereof). If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock, securities or other property or assets
(including cash or any combination thereof) of a Person other than the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, in such
Merger Event, then such other Person shall also execute such supplemental indenture, and such supplemental indenture shall contain such additional
provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Notes, including the right of Holders to require the Company to repurchase their Notes upon a
Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 15.02 and the right of Holders to require the Company to repurchase their Notes on the Repurchase Date
pursuant to Section 15.01, as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.

                                                                             86
      (b)   [RESERVED]

      (c) The Company shall not become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 14.07. None of the foregoing
provisions shall affect the right of a Holder to convert its Notes into cash, ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) or a combination of thereof, as
applicable, as set forth in Section 14.01 and Section 14.02 prior to the effective date of such Merger Event.

      (d)   The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.

      Section 14.08 Amendment upon ADS Delisting or Unavailability of ADS Facility. (a) If (i) a Fundamental Change described in clause (d) of the
definition thereof has occurred and the Ordinary Shares are listed and traded on a Permitted Exchange on the effective date of such Fundamental
Change, or (ii) the Ordinary Shares cease to be represented by American depositary shares issued under a depositary receipt program sponsored by the
Company and the Ordinary Shares at that time are listed and traded on any U.S. Exchange or Permitted Exchange (each, an “Amendment Event”),
then, on and after the effective date of an Amendment Event, Section 14.07 shall be deemed to apply mutatis mutandis as if the Reference Property for
the Notes were the Ordinary Shares and other property, if any, represented by the ADSs on the effective date of such Amendment Event; provided that
the supplemental indenture required therein to reflect the replacement of the ADSs with the Ordinary Shares and other property, if any, shall be executed
no later than five Business Days after the effective date of such Amendment Event and, in addition to the amendments described under Section 14.07,
the supplemental indenture shall provide that:
            (i) each reference herein to the ADSs related to the terms of the Notes shall be replaced by a reference to the number of Ordinary Shares
      and other property, if any, represented by the ADSs on the effective date of such Amendment Event;
           (ii) all references to the “Last Reported Sale Price,” “Daily VWAP” and “Trading Day” of the ADSs shall be replaced by the “Last
      Reported Sale Price,” “Daily VWAP” and ‘Trading Day” of the Ordinary Shares, respectively, as customarily defined for securities traded on the
      Relevant Exchange;
           (iii) if a Fundamental Change described in clause (d) of the definition thereof has occurred, references to “any of The New York Stock
      Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market (or any of their respective successors)” in the definition of
      “Fundamental Change” shall be replaced by such Relevant Exchange (or its successor);
            (iv) other appropriate adjustments, including adjustments to the Conversion Rate and anti-dilution adjustment as contemplated by
      Section 14.04, shall be made to reflect such Amendment Event; and

                                                                           87
           (v) other provisions that the Board of Directors reasonably determines are appropriate shall be made to preserve the economic interests of
      the Holders and to give effect to the provisions described above.

      (b) In making any amendment to the terms or definitions relating to trading and listing of Class Z ordinary shares, including, but not limited to,
“Last Reported Sale Price,” “Daily VWAP,” “Trading Day” and “Fundamental Change,” the relevant exchange on which Ordinary Shares are listed are
traded for purpose of such terms and definition (the “Relevant Exchange”) will be deemed to be:
            (i)   if the Ordinary Shares at that time are listed on an U.S. Exchange, such U.S. Exchange;
           (ii) if the Ordinary Shares at that time are not listed on any U.S. Exchange but are listed on a Permitted Exchange, such Permitted
      Exchange; provided that if the Ordinary Shares at that time are listed on more than one Permitted Exchanges, the Permitted Exchange that is the
      primary stock exchange for the Ordinary Shares, provided further that if the Ordinary Shares at that time are listed on more than one Permitted
      Exchange that is a primary stock exchange for the Ordinary Shares, the primary stock exchange where there is highest trading volume of the
      Ordinary Shares at the time of the amendment.

       (c) In making such amendments, where currency translations between U.S. dollars and any other currency are required, the exchange rate in
effect on the date of determination as the Board of Directors determines in good faith will apply.

    (d) For the avoidance of doubt, such amendments described under this Section 14.08 shall not affect the right of Holders to require the
Company to repurchase their Notes upon a Fundamental Change in accordance with Section 15.02.

      (e) The Company shall notify Holders and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date the Company executes such supplemental indenture as contemplated by this Section 14.08 and shall substantially concurrently with
such notice either post such supplemental indenture on the Company’s website or disclose the same in a current report on Form 6-K (or any successor
form) that is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

      Section 14.09 Certain Covenants. (a) The Company covenants that all ADSs delivered upon conversion of Notes, and all Ordinary Shares
represented by such ADSs, will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue
thereof.

      (b) The Company covenants that, if any ADSs to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder, or any Ordinary Shares
represented by such ADSs or deliverable in lieu thereof, require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state
law before such ADSs or Ordinary Shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will, to the extent then permitted by the rules and
interpretations of the Commission, secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.

                                                                           88
     (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the ADSs or Ordinary Shares shall be listed on any national securities exchange or
automated quotation system the Company will list and keep listed, so long as the ADSs or Ordinary Shares shall be so listed on such exchange or
automated quotation system, any ADSs or Ordinary Shares deliverable upon conversion of the Notes.

      (d) The Company further covenants to take all actions and obtain all approvals and registrations required with respect to (i) the conversion of
the Notes into ADSs and the issuance, and deposit into the ADS facility, of the Ordinary Shares represented by such ADSs; and (ii) issuance and
delivery of Ordinary Shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion at a Holder’s election . The Company also undertakes to maintain, as long
as any Notes are outstanding, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form F-6 relating to the ADSs and an adequate number of ADSs and
Ordinary Shares available for issuance thereunder such that ADSs and Ordinary Shares can be delivered in accordance with the terms of this Indenture,
the Notes and the Unrestricted Deposit Agreement, the Restricted Deposit Agreement and the Procedures Letter, as applicable, upon conversion of the
Notes. In addition, the Company further covenants to provide Holders with a reasonably detailed description of the mechanics for the delivery of ADSs
upon conversion of Notes as set forth in the Unrestricted Deposit Agreement, the Restricted Deposit Agreement and the Procedures Letter, as applicable,
upon request.

       Section 14.10 Responsibility of Trustee. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any
Holder to determine the Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any increase)
of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method
employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent shall not be
accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof), or of any securities, property
or cash that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and the Conversion Agent make no representations
with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any
ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of
conversion, the accuracy or inaccuracy of any mathematical calculation or formulae under this Indenture, whether by the Company or any Person so
authorized by the Company for such purpose under this Indenture or the failure by the Company to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or
covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall
be under any responsibility to determine (i) whether a supplemental indenture needs to be entered into or (b) the correctness of any provisions contained
in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 14.07 or elsewhere in this Article 14 relating either to the kind or amount of ADSs (or
Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event
referred to in such Section 14.07 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 7.02,
may accept (without any independent investigation) as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying
upon, the Officers’ Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture)
with respect thereto.

                                                                           89
      Section 14.11 Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions. In case of any: (a) action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries that would
require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.04 or Section 14.11;

      (b)   Merger Event; or

      (c)   voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

then, in each case (unless notice of such event is otherwise required pursuant to another provision of this Indenture), the Company shall cause to be filed
with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing on the Note Register, as
promptly as possible but in any event at least 20 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is
to be taken for the purpose of such action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of
Ordinary Shares or ADSs, as the case may be, of record are to be determined for the purposes of such action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries,
or (ii) the date on which such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it
is expected that holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs, as the case may be, of record shall be entitled to exchange their Ordinary Shares or ADSs, as the
case may be, for securities or other property deliverable upon such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or
any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, Merger Event, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up.

       Section 14.12 Stockholder Rights Plans. To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Notes into ADSs (or
Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof), each ADS (or Ordinary Share in lieu thereof) delivered upon such conversion shall be entitled to receive (either directly
or in respect of the Ordinary Shares underlying, or delivered in lieu of such ADSs) the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates
representing the ADSs delivered upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any such
stockholder rights plan, as the same may be amended from time to time. However, if, prior to any Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the
Ordinary Shares underlying, or delivered in lieu of the ADSs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights plan, the Conversion
Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all or substantially all holders of the Ordinary Shares Distributed
Property as provided in Section 14.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

      Section 14.13 Termination of Depositary Receipt Program. If the Ordinary Shares cease to be represented by American depositary shares issued
under a depositary receipt program sponsored by the Company, then Section 14.07 will be deemed to apply mutatis mutandis as if the Reference
Property for the Notes were the Ordinary Shares and other property, if any, represented by the ADSs as described under Section 14.08.

                                                                             90
      Section 14.14 Exchange in Lieu of Conversion. (a) When a Holder surrenders its Notes for conversion, the Company may, at its election (an
“Exchange Election”), direct the Conversion Agent to deliver, on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the Conversion Date, such Notes
to one or more financial institutions designated by the Company (each, a “Designated Financial Institution”) for exchange in lieu of conversion. In
order to accept any Notes surrendered for conversion, the Designated Financial Institution(s) must agree to timely pay and/or deliver, as the case may be,
in exchange for such Notes, the cash, ADSs ( or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) or a combination thereof, as applicable, that would otherwise be due
upon conversion pursuant to Section 14.02 (the “Conversion Consideration”). If the Company makes an Exchange Election, the Company shall, by the
close of business on the Business Day following the relevant Conversion Date, notify in writing the Trustee, the Conversion Agent (if other than the
Trustee) and the Holder surrendering Notes for conversion that the Company has made the Exchange Election and the Company shall promptly notify
the Designated Financial Institution(s) of the relevant deadline for delivery of the Conversion Consideration and the type of Conversion Consideration to
be paid and/or delivered, as the case may be.

       (b) Any Notes delivered to the Designated Financial Institution(s) shall remain outstanding, subject to applicable procedures of the Depositary.
If the Designated Financial Institution(s) agree(s) to accept any Notes for exchange but does not timely pay and/or deliver, as the case may be, the
related Conversion Consideration, or if such Designated Financial Institution(s) does not accept the Notes for exchange, the Company shall pay and/or
deliver, as the case may be, the relevant Conversion Consideration, as, and at the time, required pursuant to the Indenture as if the Company had not
made the Exchange Election.

      (c) The Company’s designation of any Designated Financial Institution(s) to which the Notes may be submitted for exchange does not require
such Designated Financial Institution(s) to accept any Notes.


                                                              ARTICLE 15
                                               REPURCHASE OF NOTES AT OPTION OF HOLDERS

       Section 15.01 Repurchase at Option of Holders. (a) Each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder’s option, to require the Company to
repurchase for cash on December 1, 2024 (the “Repurchase Date”), all of such Holder’s Notes, or any portion thereof that is an integral multiple of
US$1,000 principal amount, at a repurchase price (the “Repurchase Price”) that is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Repurchase Date; provided that any such accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid
not to the Holders submitting the Notes for repurchase on the Repurchase Date but instead to the Holders of such Notes at the close of business on the
Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Repurchase Date. Not later than 20 Business Days prior to the Repurchase Date, the Company shall
mail a notice (the “Company Notice”) by first class mail to the Trustee, to the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) and to
each Holder at its address shown in the Note Register of the Note Registrar (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law and to the
Conversion Agent if other than the Trustee). The Company Notice shall include a Form of Repurchase Notice to be completed by a holder and shall
state:
            (i)   the last date on which a Holder may exercise its repurchase right pursuant to this Section 15.01 (the “Repurchase Expiration Time”);

                                                                           91
            (ii)    the Repurchase Price; (iii) the Repurchase Date;
            (iv)    the name and address of the Conversion Agent and Paying Agent;
           (v) that the Notes with respect to which a Repurchase Notice has been delivered by a Holder may be converted only if the Holder
      withdraws the Repurchase Notice in accordance with the terms of this Indenture;
            (vi)    that the Holder shall have the right to withdraw any Notes surrendered prior to the Repurchase Expiration Time; and
            (vii)    the procedures a Holder must follow to exercise its repurchase rights under this Section 15.01 and a brief description of those rights.

       At the Company’s request, the Trustee shall give such notice in the Company’s name and at the Company’s expense; provided, however, that, in
all cases, the text of such Company Notice shall be prepared by the Company.

      Simultaneously with providing the Company Notice, the Company shall publish a notice containing the information included in the Company
Notice in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York or publish such information on the Company’s website or through such other
public medium as the Company may use at that time.

      No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices and no defect therein shall limit the Holders’ repurchase rights or affect the validity of the
proceedings for the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to this Section 15.01.

      Repurchases of Notes under this Section 15.01 shall be made, at the option of the Holder thereof, upon:
                    (A) delivery to the Trustee (or other agent appointed for such purpose) by the Holder of a duly completed notice (the “Repurchase
              Notice”) in the form set forth in Attachment 3 to the Form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A, if the Notes are Physical Notes, or in
              compliance with the Depositary’s procedures for surrendering interests in global notes, if the Notes are Global Notes, in each case at any
              time during the period beginning from the open of business on the date that is 20 Business Days prior to the Repurchase Date until the
              close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Repurchase Date; and
                    (B) delivery of the Notes, if the Notes are Physical Notes, to the Trustee at any time after delivery of the Repurchase Notice
              (together with all necessary endorsements) at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee (or other agent appointed for such purpose), or
              book-entry transfer of the Notes, if the Notes are Global Notes, in compliance with the procedures of the Depositary, in each case such
              delivery being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Repurchase Price therefor.

                                                                              92
      Each Repurchase Notice shall state:
                   (A)    in the case of Physical Notes, the certificate numbers of the Notes to be delivered for repurchase;
                   (B)    the portion of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, which must be US$1,000 or an integral multiple thereof;
             and
                   (C)    that the Notes are to be repurchased by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Notes and this Indenture;

provided, however, that if the Notes are Global Notes, the Repurchase Notice must comply with appropriate Depositary procedures.

       Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Trustee the Repurchase Notice contemplated by this Section 15.01
shall have the right to withdraw, in whole or in part, such Repurchase Notice at any time prior to the close of business on the second Business Day
immediately preceding the Repurchase Date by delivery of a duly completed written notice of withdrawal to the Trustee (or other agent appointed for
such purpose) in accordance with Section 15.03.

      The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Repurchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof.

      No Repurchase Notice with respect to any Notes may be delivered and no Note may be surrendered for repurchase pursuant to this Section 15.01
by a Holder thereof to the extent such Holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice with respect to such Note in accordance with
Section 15.02 and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 15.03.

       (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Notes may be repurchased by the Company at the option of the Holders on the Repurchase Date if the
principal amount of the Notes has been accelerated, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to such Repurchase Date (except in the
case of an acceleration resulting from a default by the Company in the payment of the Repurchase Price with respect to such Notes). The Trustee will
promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Physical Notes held by it during the acceleration of the Notes (except in the case of an acceleration
resulting from a default by the Company in the payment of the Repurchase Price with respect to such Notes), or any instructions for book-entry transfer
of the Notes in compliance with the procedures of the Depositary shall be deemed to have been cancelled, and, upon such return or cancellation, as the
case may be, the Repurchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.

                                                                            93
       Section 15.02 Repurchase at Option of Holders Upon a Fundamental Change. (a) If a Fundamental Change occurs at any time, each Holder
shall have the right, at such Holder’s option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such Holder’s Notes, or any portion thereof that is
equal to US$1,000 or an integral multiple of US$1,000, on the Business Day (the “Fundamental Change Repurchase Date”) notified in writing by the
Company as set forth in Section 15.02(c) that is not less than 20 Business Days or more than 35 Business Days following the date of the Fundamental
Change Company Notice at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding,
the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (the “Fundamental Change Repurchase Price”), unless the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date falls
after a Regular Record Date but on or prior to the Interest Payment Date to which such Regular Record Date relates, in which case the Company shall
instead pay the full amount of accrued and unpaid interest to Holders as of such Regular Record Date, and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price
shall be equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased pursuant to this Article 15. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent, Paying
Agent or any other agent appointed for such purpose shall have no responsibility to determine the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price.

      (b)   Repurchases of Notes under this Section 15.02 shall be made, at the option of the Holder thereof, upon:
            (i) delivery to the Trustee (or other agent appointed for this purpose) by a Holder of a duly completed notice (the “Fundamental Change
      Repurchase Notice”) in the form set forth in Attachment 2 to the Form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A, if the Notes are Physical Notes, or in
      compliance with the Depositary’s procedures for surrendering interests in global notes, if the Notes are Global Notes, in each case on or before the
      close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date; and
            (ii) delivery of the Notes, if the Notes are Physical Notes, at any time after delivery of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice
      (together with all necessary endorsements for transfer) at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or to other agent appointed for such purpose, or
      book-entry transfer of the Notes, if the Notes are Global Notes, in compliance with the procedures of the Depositary, in each case such delivery
      being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price therefor.

      The Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in respect of any Notes to be repurchased shall state:
            (i)     in the case of Physical Notes, the certificate numbers of the Notes to be delivered for repurchase;
            (ii)    the portion of the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased, which must be US$1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and
            (iii)    that the Notes are to be repurchased by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Notes and this Indenture;

provided, however, that if the Notes are Global Notes, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice must comply with appropriate Depositary
procedures.

                                                                               94
      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Trustee the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice contemplated
by this Section 15.02 shall have the right to withdraw, in whole or in part, such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice at any time prior to the close of
business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date by delivery of a duly completed written notice
of withdrawal to the Trustee in accordance with Section 15.03.

      The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal
thereof.

      No Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice with respect to any Notes may be delivered and no Note may be surrendered by a Holder for
repurchase thereof if such Holder has also surrendered a Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 15.01 and not validly withdrawn such
Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 15.03.

       (c) On or before the 20th calendar day after the occurrence of the effective date of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide to all
Holders, the Trustee (and the Conversion Agent, Paying Agent and any other agent appointed for this purpose, in each case, if other than the Trustee) a
written notice (the “Fundamental Change Company Notice”) of the occurrence of the effective date of the Fundamental Change and of the repurchase
right at the option of the Holders arising as a result thereof. In the case of Physical Notes, such notice shall be by first class mail or, in the case of Global
Notes, such notice shall be delivered in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depositary. Simultaneously with providing such notice, the
Company shall publish a notice containing the information set forth in the Fundamental Change Company Notice in a newspaper of general circulation
in The City of New York or publish such information on the Company’s website or through such other public medium as the Company may use at that
time. Each Fundamental Change Company Notice shall specify:
            (i)     the events causing the Fundamental Change and whether such transaction or event also constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change;
            (ii)    the effective date of the Fundamental Change;
            (iii)    the last date on which a Holder may exercise the repurchase right pursuant to this Article 15;
            (iv)     the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price; (v) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date;
            (vi) the name and address of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Conversion Agent or any other agent appointed for repurchase, if
      applicable;
          (vii) if applicable, the Conversion Rate and any adjustments to the Conversion Rate as a result of such Fundamental Change if it is a
      Make-Whole Fundamental Change;
           (viii) if applicable, that the Notes with respect to which a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice has been delivered by a Holder may be
      converted only if the Holder withdraws the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; and

                                                                               95
            (ix)    the procedures that Holders must follow to require the Company to repurchase their Notes.

      No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices and no defect therein shall limit the Holders’ repurchase rights or affect the validity of the
proceedings for the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to this Section 15.02.

       At the Company’s request, the Trustee shall give such notice in the Company’s name and at the Company’s expense; provided, however, that, in
all cases, the text of such Fundamental Change Company Notice shall be prepared by the Company.

      (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Notes may be repurchased by the Company on any date at the option of the Holders upon a Fundamental
Change if the principal amount of the Notes has been accelerated, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to such date (except in the
case of an acceleration resulting from a default by the Company in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price with respect to such
Notes). The Trustee will promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Physical Notes held by it during the acceleration of the Notes (except in
the case of an acceleration resulting from a default by the Company in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price with respect to such
Notes), or any instructions for book-entry transfer of the Notes in compliance with the procedures of the Depositary shall be deemed to have been
cancelled, and, upon such return or cancellation, as the case may be, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed
to have been withdrawn.

      Section 15.03 Withdrawal of Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice. (a) A Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change
Repurchase Notice may be withdrawn (in whole or in part) by means of a duly completed written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Trustee (or other
agent appointed for such purpose) in accordance with this Section 15.03 at any time prior to the close of business on the second Business Day
immediately preceding the Repurchase Date or prior to the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, specifying:
            (i)    the principal amount of the Notes with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted,
           (ii) if Physical Notes have been issued, the certificate number of the Note in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being
      submitted, and
           (iii) the principal amount, if any, of such Note that remains subject to the original Repurchase Notice or Fundamental Change Repurchase
      Notice, as the case may be, which portion must be in principal amounts of US$1,000 or an integral multiple of US$1,000;

provided, however, that if the Notes are Global Notes, the notice must comply with appropriate procedures of the Depositary.

                                                                            96
       Section 15.04 Deposit of Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price. (a) The Company will deposit with the Paying Agent
(or any other agent appointed for this purpose by the Company), or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, set aside, segregate and hold in
trust as provided in Section 4.04) on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day prior to the Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date, as the case may be, an amount of money sufficient to repurchase all of the Notes to be repurchased at the appropriate Repurchase
Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price. Subject to receipt of funds and/or Notes by the Paying Agent (or other agent appointed for this purpose
by the Company) and the Trustee, as applicable, payment for Notes surrendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn in accordance with Section 15.03)
will be made on the later of (i) the Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, (provided the Holder has satisfied the
conditions in Section 15.01 or Section 15.02, as the case may be) and (ii) the time of book-entry transfer or the delivery of such Note to the Trustee (or
other agent appointed for this purpose by the Company) by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 15.01 or Section 15.02, as applicable,
by mailing checks for the amount payable to the Holders of such Notes entitled thereto as they shall appear in the Note Register; provided, however, that
payments to the Depositary shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee. The Paying
Agent (or other agent appointed for this purpose by the Company) shall, promptly after such payment and upon written demand by the Company, return
to the Company any funds in excess of the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, as the case may be.

       (b) If by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, the Paying
Agent (or other agent appointed for this purpose by the Company) holds money sufficient to make payment on all the Notes or portions thereof that are
to be repurchased on such Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be, then, with respect to the Notes that have been
properly surrendered for repurchase and not validly withdrawn, on such Repurchase Date or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be,
(i) such Notes will cease to be outstanding, (ii) interest will cease to accrue on such Notes (whether or not book-entry transfer of the Notes has been
made or the Notes have been delivered to the Trustee) and (iii) all other rights of the Holders of such Notes will terminate (other than the right to receive
the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, as the case may be, and previously accrued and unpaid interest upon delivery or
transfer of the Notes to the extent not included in the Repurchase Price or Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, as the case may be).

      (c) Upon surrender of a Note that is to be repurchased in part pursuant to Section 15.01 or Section 15.02, the Company shall execute and the
Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder a new Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal
amount to the unrepurchased portion of the Note surrendered.

       Section 15.05 Covenant to Comply with Applicable Laws Upon Repurchase of Notes. In connection with any repurchase offer, the Company
will, if required: (a) comply with the provisions of Rule 13e-4, Rule 14e-1 and any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act;

      (b)   file a Schedule TO or other required schedule under the Exchange Act; and

                                                                             97
      (c)   otherwise comply with all federal and state securities laws in connection with any offer by the Company to repurchase the Notes;

in each case, so as to permit the rights and obligations under this Article 15 to be exercised in the time and in the manner specified in this Article 15.


                                                                        ARTICLE 16
                                                                       REDEMPTION

      Section 16.01 Redemption for Changes in the Tax Law of the Relevant Jurisdiction. (a) Other than as described in this Article 16, the Notes may
not be redeemed by the Company at its option prior to maturity. If the Company has, or on the next Interest Payment Date would, become obligated to
pay to the Holder of any Note Additional Amounts that are more than a de minimis amount, as a result of:
            (i) any change or amendment that is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after November 19, 2021 (or, in the case of a
      jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Jurisdiction after such date, after such later date) in the laws or any rules or regulations of a Relevant
      Jurisdiction; or
            (ii) any change that is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after November 19, 2021 (or, in the case of a jurisdiction that
      becomes a Relevant Jurisdiction after such date, after such later date) in an interpretation, administration or application of such laws, rules or
      regulations by any legislative body, court, governmental agency, taxing authority or regulatory or administrative authority of such Relevant
      Jurisdiction (including the enactment of any legislation and the announcement or publication of any judicial decision or regulatory or
      administrative interpretation or determination);
      (each, a “Change in Tax Law”), the Company may, at its option, at any time before the 44th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the
      Maturity Date, redeem all but not part of the Notes (except in respect of certain Holders that elect otherwise as described below) at a redemption
      price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (the “Redemption Price”), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the
      date fixed by the Company for redemption (the “Redemption Date”), including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Amounts with respect
      to such Redemption Price (such redemption, a “Tax Redemption”); provided that the Company may only redeem the Notes if: (i) the Company
      cannot avoid such obligations by taking commercially reasonable measures available to the Company (provided that changing the jurisdiction of
      incorporation of the Company shall be deemed not to be a commercially reasonable measure); and (ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee an
      opinion of outside legal counsel of recognized standing in the Relevant Jurisdiction and an Officers’ Certificate attesting to such Change in Tax
      Law and obligation to pay Additional Amounts. The Trustee shall and is entitled to rely upon such opinion and Officers’ Certificate (without
      further investigation and enquiry) and it shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

                                                                              98
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 16, neither the Company nor any successor Person may redeem any of the Notes in the
case that Additional Amounts are payable in respect of PRC withholding tax and any other tax collected at source at the Applicable PRC Rate or less
solely as a result of the Company or its successor Person being considered a PRC tax resident under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax law.

       (b) If the Redemption Date for the Tax Redemption occurs after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment
Date, the Company shall pay or cause the Paying Agent to pay, on or at its election, before such Interest Payment Date, the full amount of accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and any Additional Amounts with respect to such interest, due on such Interest Payment Date to the record holder of the Notes on
the Regular Record Date corresponding to such Interest Payment Date, and the Redemption Price payable to any Holder (other than a Holder that elects
to not have its Notes redeemed pursuant to the provisions described below) shall be equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Amounts with respect to such Redemption Price. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing
of its election and the date on which such interest and any Additional Amounts with respect to such interest shall be paid at the time the Company
provides notice of such redemption.

      (c) Upon receiving the Redemption Notice for a Tax Redemption, each Holder shall have the right to elect to not have its Notes redeemed,
provided that (i) the Company shall not be obligated to pay any Additional Amounts on any payment with respect to such Notes solely as a result of
such Change in Tax Law that resulted in the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts (whether upon conversion, required repurchase in connection
with a Fundamental Change or on the Repurchase Date, at maturity or otherwise, and whether in cash, ADSs (or Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof) or a
combination thereof, Reference Property or otherwise) after the Redemption Date (or, if the Company fails to pay the Redemption Price on the
Redemption Date, such later date on which the Company pays the Redemption Price), and (ii) all future payments with respect to such Notes shall be
subject to the deduction or withholding of such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and taxes required by law to be deducted or withheld as a result of such
Change in Tax Law; provided further that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder electing not to have its Notes redeemed converts its Notes in
connection with the Company’s election to redeem the Notes in respect of such Change in Tax Law pursuant to Section 14.03(g), the Company shall be
obligated to pay Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to such conversion.

       (d) Subject to the applicable procedures of the Depositary in the case of Global Notes, a Holder electing to not have its Notes redeemed
pursuant to this Section 16.01 must deliver to the Paying Agent a written notice of election so as to be received by the Paying Agent no later than the
close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date; provided that, a Holder that complies with the requirements
for conversion in Section 14.02(b) prior to the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date shall be
deemed to have delivered a notice of its election to not have its Notes so redeemed. A Holder may withdraw any notice of election (other than such a
deemed notice of election in connection with a conversion) by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal prior to the close of
business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date (or, if the Company fails to pay the Redemption Price on the
Redemption Date, such later date on which the Company pays the Redemption Price). If no election is made or deemed to have been made, the Holder
shall have its Notes redeemed without any further action.

                                                                           99
      Section 16.02 Optional Redemption on or after December 1, 2024. (a) Except as described in Section 16.01 and Section 16.03, the Notes may
not be redeemed by the Company at its option prior to December 1, 2024. The Company may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes, at its option,
on a Redemption Date on or after December 1, 2024 and before the 44th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, if the Last
Reported Sale Price of the ADSs has been at least 130% of the Conversion Price then in effect for at least 20 Trading Days (whether or not consecutive)
during any 30 consecutive Trading Day period (including the last Trading Day of such period) ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Redemption Notice Date (such redemption, an “Optional Redemption”).

      (b) The Redemption Price for an Optional Redemption shall be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if the Redemption Date occurs after a Regular Record Date
and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, then (i) the Company shall pay on the Interest Payment Date the full amount of accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, due on such Interest Payment Date to the record Holder of the Notes on the Regular Record Date corresponding to such Interest
Payment Date, and (ii) the Redemption Price payable to the Holder who presents a Note for the Optional Redemption shall be equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Note, without the accrued and unpaid interest on such Note to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.

      (c) If less than all Notes then outstanding are called for an Optional Redemption, then the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed (in
principal amounts of US$1,000 or multiples thereof) by lot or, on a pro rata basis (subject to rounding to the nearest US$1,000 principal amount) and, in
the case of a Global Note, in accordance with, and subject to, DTC’s applicable procedures.

     (d) If a portion of a Holder’s Notes are selected for a partial Optional Redemption and the Holder converts a portion of such Notes, the
converted portion shall be deemed to be from the portion selected for such Optional Redemption.

      (e) If the Company elects to redeem less than all of the outstanding Notes pursuant to this Section 16.01(a), and the Holder of any Note, or any
owner of a beneficial interest in any Global Note, is reasonably not able to determine, before the close of business on the 45th Scheduled Trading Day
immediately preceding the Redemption Date, whether such Note or beneficial interest, as applicable, is to be redeemed pursuant to such Optional
Redemption, then such Holder or owner, as applicable, will be entitled to convert such Note or beneficial interest, as applicable, at any time before the
close of business on the second Business Day immediately before such Redemption Date, and each such conversion will be deemed to be of a Note
called for Optional Redemption for purposes of this Section 16.01(a) and Section 14.03(g).

      (f) In the event of any Optional Redemption in part, the Company shall not be required to register the transfer of or exchange any Note so
selected for Optional Redemption, in whole or in part, except the non-redeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

                                                                           100
       Section 16.03 Cleanup Redemption. (a) The Company may redeem for cash all but not part of the Notes at any time, on a Redemption Date
before the 44th Scheduled Trading Day immediately precedent the Maturity Date, if less than US$140,000,000 (as increased by an amount equal to 10%
of the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes purchased by the Initial Purchasers pursuant to the exercise of their option to purchase
additional Notes as set forth in the Purchase Agreement) aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding at such time (such redemption, a
“Cleanup Redemption”).

       (b) The Redemption Price for a Cleanup Redemption shall be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if the Redemption Date occurs after a Regular Record Date and on
or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, then (i) the Company shall pay on the Interest Payment Date the full amount of accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, due on such Interest Payment Date to the record Holder of the Notes on the Regular Record Date corresponding to such Interest Payment
Date, and (ii) the Redemption Price payable to the Holder who presents a Note for the Cleanup Redemption shall be equal to 100% of the principal
amount of such Note, without the accrued and unpaid interest on such Note to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.

      Section 16.04 Redemption Notice. (a) To call any Notes for a redemption pursuant to Article 16, the Company shall (x) provide a Redemption
Notice not less than 46 Scheduled Trading Days but no more than 60 Scheduled Trading Days before the Redemption Date to the Trustee, the
Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee), the Paying Agent (if other than the Trustee) and each Holder of Notes selected for redemption, and
(y) simultaneously therewith, publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the The City of New York or on the Company’s website or
through such other public medium as the Company may use at that time containing the information set forth in the Redemption Notice. The Redemption
Date must be a Business Day. The Company may not specify a Redemption Date that falls on or after the 44th Scheduled Trading Day immediately
preceding the Maturity Date.

      (b)   Such Redemption Notice must state:
            (i)    that the Notes have been called for redemption, briefly describing the Company’s redemption right under this Supplemental Indenture;
            (ii)   the Redemption Date for such redemption;
            (iii) the Redemption Price per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes (and, if the Redemption Date is after a Regular Record Date and on or
      before the next Interest Payment Date, the amount, manner and timing of the interest payment payable);
            (iv)    the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent;
            (v)    that Notes called for redemption may be converted at any time during the related Redemption Period;

                                                                           101
            (vi) the Conversion Rate in effect on the Redemption Notice Date for such redemption and a description and quantification of any
      adjustments to the Conversion Rate that may result from such redemption (including pursuant to Section 14.03(g));
           (vii) the Settlement Method that will apply to all conversions of Notes with a Conversion Date that occurs on or after such Redemption
      Notice Date and on or before the second Business Day before such Redemption Date; and

      (c)   the CUSIP and ISIN numbers, if any, of the Notes..

       Section 16.05 No Redemption upon Acceleration. No Notes may be redeemed by the Company or its successor if the principal amount of the
Notes has been accelerated, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to the Redemption Date (except in the case of an acceleration
resulting from a Default by the Company in the payment of the Redemption Price with respect to such Notes).


                                                                 ARTICLE 17

      So long as and to the extent that the Notes are represented by Global Notes and such Global Notes are held by DTC, notices to owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to DTC for communication by it to entitled account holders.

                                                                           102
       The Company hereby acknowledges that it is fully aware of the risks associated with transmitting instructions via electronic methods (including
facsimile), and being aware of these risks, authorizes the Trustee to accept and act upon any instruction sent to it or any Paying Agent, Transfer Agent,
Conversion Agent or Note Registrar in the Company’s name or in the name of one or more appropriate authorized signers of the Company via electronic
methods (including facsimile). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on Section 7.06 of this Indenture when accepting or acting upon any instructions,
communications or documents transmitted by facsimile, and shall not be liable in the event any facsimile transmission is not received, or is mutilated,
illegible, interrupted, duplicated, incomplete, unauthorized or delayed for any reason, including (but not limited to) electronic or telecommunications
failure.

       Furthermore, notwithstanding the above, if any Trustee receives information or instructions delivered by electronic mail, other electronic method
or other unsecured method of communication believed by it to be genuine and to have been sent by the proper person or persons, the Trustee or any
Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, Conversion Agent or Note Registrar shall have (i) no duty or obligation to verify or confirm that the person who sent
such instructions is in fact a person authorized to give instructions or directions on behalf of the Company and (ii) absent its or their gross negligence or

    Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders

     Section 17.04 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. THIS INDENTURE AND EACH NOTE, AND ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE
ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS INDENTURE AND EACH NOTE, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

       The Company irrevocably consents and agrees, for the benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Notes and the Trustee, that any legal action,
suit or proceeding against it with respect to obligations, liabilities or any other matter arising out of or in connection with this Indenture or the Notes
may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or the courts of the United States located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York
and, until amounts due and to become due in respect of the Notes have been paid, hereby irrevocably consents and submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in personam, generally and unconditionally with respect to any action, suit or proceeding for itself in respect of its
properties, assets and revenues.

                                                                             103
       The Company irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Indenture brought in the courts of the
State of New York or the courts of the United States located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

       Section 17.05 Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process. The Company irrevocably appoints Law Debenture Corporate Service Inc. as its
authorized agent in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York upon which process may be served in any such suit or proceeding, and agrees
that service of process upon such agent, and written notice of said service to the Company by the person serving the same to Building 20, No. 56 AnTuo

service of process upon the Company in any such suit or proceeding. The Company further agrees to take any and all action as may be necessary to
maintain such designation and appointment of such agent in full force and effect for a period of seven years from the date of this Indenture. If for any
reason such agent shall cease to be such agent for service of process, the Company shall forthwith appoint a new agent of recognized standing for
service of process in the State of New York and deliver to the Trustee a copy of the new agent’s acceptance of that appointment within ten Business
Days of such acceptance. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Trustee, any agent or any Holder to serve process in any other manner permitted by
law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Company in any other court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent that the
Company has or hereafter may acquire any sovereign or other immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process with respect to itself or
its property, the Company irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations hereunder or under any Note.

       Each Officers’ Certificate provided for, by or on behalf of the Company in this Indenture and delivered to the Trustee with respect to compliance
with this Indenture (other than the Officers’ Certificates provided for in Section 4.09) shall include (a) a statement that the person making such
certificate is familiar with the requested action and this Indenture; (b) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation
upon which the statement contained in such certificate is based; (c) a statement that, in the judgment of such person, he or she has made such

Indenture; and (d) a statement as to whether or not, in the judgment of such person, such action is permitted by this Indenture.

                                                                            104
       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 17.06, if any provision in this Indenture specifically provides that the Trustee shall or
may receive an Opinion of Counsel in connection with any action to be taken by the Trustee or the Company hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to,
or entitled to request, such Opinion of Counsel.

       Section 17.07 Legal Holidays. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Fundamental Change Repurchase Date,
Conversion Date, Repurchase Date or Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then any action to be taken on such date need not be taken on such date, but
may be taken on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if taken on such date, and no interest shall accrue in respect of the
delay.

practicable under the circumstances.

                                                         0.50% Convertibile Senior Note due 2026

      This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Company, designated as its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”),
limited to the aggregate principal amount of US$1,400,000,000 (as increased by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any additional
Notes purchased by the Initial Purchasers pursuant to the exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes as set forth in the Purchase Agreement),
subject to Section 2.10 of the Indenture, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 23, 2021 (the “Indenture”),
between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties, privileges, disclaimers from liability and
immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Notes. Additional Notes may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal
amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture.

       In the case certain Events of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of, and interest on, all Notes
may be declared, by either the Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, and upon said declaration
shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions and certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture. In the case
certain Events of Default relating to a bankruptcy (or similar proceeding) with respect to the Company or a Significant Subsidiary of the Company shall
have occurred, the principal of, and interest on, all Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable, as set forth in the Indenture.

       Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make or cause the Paying Agent to make all payments in respect of the
principal amount on the Maturity Date, the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, as the case may be,
to the Holder who surrenders a Note to collect such payments in respect of the Note. The Company will pay or cause the Paying Agent to pay cash
amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

       Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, Additional Amounts will be paid in connection with any payments made and deliveries
caused to be made by the Company or any successor to the Company under or with respect to the Indenture and the Notes, including, but not limited to,
payments of principal (including, if applicable, the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price), payments
of interest and payment of cash and/or deliveries of ADSs or Ordinary Shares deliverable upon conversion of Notes in lieu of such ADSs at a Holder’s
election or any other consideration due on conversion of a Note (together with payments of cash for any fractional ADS) upon conversion of the Notes
to ensure that the net amount received by the beneficial owner of the Notes after any applicable withholding or deduction or reduction (and after
deducting any taxes on the Additional Amounts) will equal the amounts that would have been received by such beneficial owner had no such
withholding, deduction or reduction been required.

                                                                             A-7
      The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the
Notes, and in certain other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the
time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures modifying the terms of the Indenture and the Notes as
described therein. It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its
consequences.

      No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay or cause to be delivered, as the case may be, the principal (including the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price and
the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, accrued and unpaid interest on, and the consideration due upon conversion of, this Note at
the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money or ADSs (including Ordinary Shares in lieu thereof), as the case may be, herein
prescribed.

      The Notes are issuable in registered form without interest coupons in minimum denominations of US$1,000 principal amount and integral
multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof. At the office or agency of the Company referred to on the face hereof, and in the manner and subject to the
limitations provided in the Indenture, Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations,
without payment of any service charge but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer or similar tax
that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such exchange of Notes being different
from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such exchange.

     The Notes may not be redeemed by the Company at its option prior to maturity other than in the event of an Optional Redemption, a Tax
Redemption or a Cleanup Redemption as described in Article 16 of the Indenture. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.

       The Holder has the right, at such Holder’s option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such Holder’s Notes or any portion thereof

                                          DESCRIPTION OF RIGHTS OF EACH CLASS OF SECURITIES
                               registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)

      As of December 31, 2021, Bilibili Inc., (or “Bilibili”, “we” , “us” , “our company” and “our”) had the following series of securities registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act:

                                                                              Trading                              Name of each exchange
                           Title of each class                               Symbol(s)                              on which registered
    American depositary shares, each representing one Class Z                  BILI                            Nasdaq Global Select Market
                         ordinary share

      Class Z ordinary shares, par value US$0.0001 per share                   9626                    The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited

     This exhibit contains a description of the rights of (i) the holders of shares and (ii) ADS holders. Shares underlying the ADSs are held by Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas, as depositary, and holders of ADSs will not be treated as holders of the shares.


Shares
Type and Class of Securities (Item 9.A.5 of Form 20-F)
       The ordinary shares of Bilibili are divided into Class Z ordinary shares and Class Y ordinary shares, each par value $0.0001 per share. The
respective number of Class Z ordinary shares and Class Y ordinary shares outstanding as of the last day of the Company’s respective fiscal year is
provided on the cover of the annual report on Form 20-F (the “Form 20-F”) of the Company. Certificates representing the ordinary shares are issued in
registered form. Bilibili will issue only non-negotiable shares, and will not issue bearer or negotiable shares.


Preemptive Rights (Item 9.A.3 of Form 20-F)
      The shareholders of Bilibili do not have preemptive rights.


Limitations or Qualifications (Item 9.A.6 of Form 20-F)
      We keep and intend to maintain a dual-class voting structure. Holders of Class Z ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holders
of Class Y ordinary shares are entitled to ten votes per share.

      As a result of the dual-class share structure and the concentration of ownership, holders of Class Y ordinary shares will have considerable
influence over matters such as decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and
other significant corporate actions. Such holders may take actions that are not in the best interest of the other shareholders of Bilibili. This concentration
of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Bilibili, which could have the effect of depriving other shareholders of the
opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of Bilibili and may reduce the price of the ADSs. This concentrated control will limit
the ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control
transactions that holders of Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial.

      A description of the differences between Class Z ordinary shares and Class Y ordinary shares is provided in “Part I—Item 10. Additional
Information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association—Ordinary Shares” of the Form 20-F.


Other Rights (Item 9.A.7 of Form 20-F)
      Not applicable.
Rights of the Shares (Item 10.B.3 of Form 20-F)
      See “Item 10.B. Additional Information—Memorandum and Articles of Association—Ordinary Shares” of the Form 20-F.


Requirements for Amendments (Item 10.B.4 of Form 20-F)
      See “Item 10.B. Additional Information—Memorandum and Articles of Association” of the Form 20-F.


Limitations on the Rights to Own Shares (Item 10.B.6 of Form 20-F)
      There are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or
exercise voting rights on our shares.


Provisions Affecting Any Change of Control (Item 10.B.7 of Form 20-F)
      See “Item 10.B. Additional Information—Memorandum and Articles of Association” of the Form 20-F.


Ownership Threshold (Item 10.B.8 of Form 20-F)
      There are no provisions in Bilibili’s seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold
above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed. However, shareholders of Bilibili will be required to disclose shareholder ownership in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations.


Differences Between the Law of Different Jurisdictions (Item 10.B.9 of Form 20-F)
      The Companies Act is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent English statutory
enactments and accordingly there are significant differences between the Companies Act and the current Companies Act of England. In addition, the
Companies Act differs from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of certain significant differences
between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their
shareholders.

       Mergers and Similar Arrangements. The Companies Act permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between
Cayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies. For these purposes, (i) “merger” means the merging of two or more constituent
companies and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company, and (ii) a “consolidation”
means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of
such companies to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve
a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and
(b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association. The plan must be filed with the Registrar
of Companies of the Cayman Islands together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and
liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and
creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette. Court
approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.

      A merger between a Cayman parent company and its Cayman subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of
shareholders of that Cayman subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that Cayman subsidiary to be merged unless that
member agrees otherwise. For this purpose a company is a “parent” of a subsidiary if it holds issued shares that together represent at least ninety percent
(90%) of the votes at a general meeting of the subsidiary.

       The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a
court in the Cayman Islands.

                                                                             2
       Save in certain limited circumstances, a shareholder of a Cayman Islands constituent company who dissents from the merger or consolidation is
entitled to payment of the fair value of his or her shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) upon
dissenting to the merger or consolidation, provide the dissenting shareholder complies strictly with the procedures set out in the Companies Act. The
exercise of such dissenter rights will preclude the exercise by the dissenting shareholder of any other rights to which he or she might otherwise be
entitled by virtue of holding shares, save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful.

      Separate from the statutory provisions relating to mergers and consolidations, the Companies Act also contains statutory provisions that facilitate
the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies by way of schemes of arrangement, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in
number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value
of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings,
convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman
Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be
expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:
       •     the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;
       •     the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of
             the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class;
       •     the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and
       •     the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act.

      The Companies Act also contains a statutory power of compulsory acquisition which may facilitate the “squeeze out” of dissentient minority
shareholder upon a tender offer. When a tender offer is made and accepted by holders of 90.0% of the shares affected within four months, the offeror
may, within a two-month period commencing on the expiration of such four-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such
shares to the offeror on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the
case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.

      If an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, or if a tender offer is made and accepted, a dissenting shareholder would have no rights
comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to
receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.

      Shareholders’ Suits. In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff to sue for a wrong done to us as a company, and as a general rule a
derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive
authority in the Cayman Islands, the Cayman Islands court can be expected to follow and apply the common law principles (namely the rule in Foss v.
Harbottle and the exceptions thereto) so that a non-controlling shareholder may be permitted to commence a class action against or derivative actions in
the name of the company to challenge actions where:
       •     a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires;
       •     the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not
             been obtained; and
       •     those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”

                                                                            3
       Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability. The Companies Act does not limit the extent to which a
company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision
may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of
committing a crime. Our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our directors and officers shall be
indemnified against all actions, proceedings, costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities incurred or sustained by such director or officer,
other than by reason of such person’s own dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in or about the conduct of our company’s business or affairs (including as
a result of any mistake of judgment) or in the execution or discharge of his duties, powers, authorities or discretions, including without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by such director or officer in defending (whether successfully or otherwise)
any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere. This standard of conduct is
generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.

     In addition, we enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional
indemnification beyond that provided in our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.

      Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under
the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

       Directors’ Fiduciary Duties. Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its
shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the
care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to
shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a
manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This
duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest
possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to
have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However,
this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by
a director, the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.

      As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and
therefore it is considered that he owes the following duties to the company—a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to
make a profit based on his position as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of
the company conflict with his personal interest or his duty to a third party, and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were
intended. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director
need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and
experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these
authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.

      Shareholder Action by Written Consent. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to
act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Cayman Islands law and our seventh amended and restated articles of association
provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who
would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held.

      Shareholder Proposals. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting
of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors
or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.

                                                                              4
       The Companies Act provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any
right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our seventh amended
and restated articles of association allow our shareholders holding in aggregate not less than 10% of all votes attaching to the outstanding shares of our
company entitled to vote at general meetings to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our board is obliged to
convene an extraordinary general meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting. Other than this right to requisition a
shareholders’ meeting, our seventh amended and restated articles of association do not provide our shareholders with any other right to put proposals
before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by Cayman Islands law
to call shareholders’ annual general meetings, but are required by the Hong Kong Listing Rules to hold in each year a general meeting as our annual
general meeting.

       Cumulative Voting. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the
corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders
on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which
increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. There are no prohibitions in relation to cumulative voting under the laws
of the Cayman Islands but our seventh amended and restated articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders
are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.

      Removal of Directors. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for
cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our
seventh amended and restated articles of association, directors may be removed with or without cause, by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.

       Transactions with Interested Shareholders. The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to
Delaware corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that
such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of
the target’s outstanding voting share within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid
for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such
shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition
transaction with the target’s board of directors.

       Cayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware
business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders,
it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on
the minority shareholders.

       Dissolution; Winding up. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve,
dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board
of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in
its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board.

      Under the Companies Act, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its
members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding
up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so. Under the Companies Act and
our seventh amended and restated articles of association, our company may be dissolved, liquidated or wound up by a special resolution of our
shareholders.

                                                                               5
      Variation of Rights of Shares. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the
approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman
Islands law, under our seventh amended and restated articles of association, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may
vary the rights attached to any class with the written consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or with the
sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.

      Amendment of Governing Documents. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with
the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman
Islands law, our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with a special resolution of our
shareholders.

      Rights of Non-resident or Foreign Shareholders. There are no limitations imposed by our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in
our seventh amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must
be disclosed.


Changes in Capital (Item 10.B.10 of Form 20-F)
      See “Item 10.B. Additional Information—Memorandum and Articles of Association” of the Form 20-F.


Debt Securities (Item 12.A of Form 20-F)
      Not applicable.


Warrants and Rights (Item 12.B of Form 20-F)
      Not applicable.


Other Securities (Item 12.C of Form 20-F)
      Not applicable.


American Depositary Shares (Items 12.D.1 and 12.D.2 of Form 20-F)
     The name of the depositary is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. The depositary’s corporate trust office at which the ADSs will be
administered is located at 1 Columbus Circle, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10019, USA. The principal executive office of the depositary is located at 1
Columbus Circle, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10019, USA.

      Each ADS will represent an ownership interest of one Class Z ordinary share, deposited with Deutsche Bank AG, Hong Kong Branch, as
custodian for the depositary. Each ADS will also represent ownership of any other securities, cash or other property which may be held by the
depositary.

      The Direct Registration System, or DRS, is a system administered by The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, pursuant to which the depositary
may register the ownership of uncertificated ADSs, which ownership shall be evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the ADS
holders entitled thereto.

       We will not treat ADS holders as our shareholders and accordingly, you, as an ADS holder, will not have shareholder rights. Cayman Islands law
governs shareholder rights. The depositary will be the holder of the Class Z ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. As a holder of ADSs, you will have
ADS holder rights. A deposit agreement among us, the depositary and you, as an ADS holder, and the beneficial owners of ADSs sets out ADS holder
rights as well as the rights and obligations of the depositary. The laws of the State of New York govern the deposit agreement and the ADSs.

                                                                               6
       The following is a summary of the material provisions of the deposit agreement. For more complete information, you should read the entire
deposit agreement and the form of American Depositary Receipt. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its
entirety by our Form F-6 filed on March 16, 2018 (Commission file No. 333- 223711), which is incorporated herein by reference, including the exhibits
thereto. For directions on how to obtain copies of those documents, see “Item 10.H. Additional Information—Documents on Display” of the Form 20-F.


Dividends and Other Distributions
How will you receive dividends and other distributions on the shares?
      The depositary has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on Class Z ordinary shares or other
deposited securities, after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of Class Z ordinary shares
your ADSs represent as of the record date (which will be as close as practicable to the record date for our Class Z ordinary shares) set by the depositary
with respect to the ADSs.
       •     Cash. The depositary will convert or cause to be converted any cash dividend or other cash distribution we pay on the Class Z ordinary
             shares or any net proceeds from the sale of any Class Z ordinary shares, rights, securities or other entitlements under the terms of the
             deposit agreement into U.S. dollars if it can do so on a practicable basis, and can transfer the U.S. dollars to the United States and will
             distribute promptly the amount thus received. If the depositary shall determine in its judgment that such conversions or transfers are not
             practical or lawful or if any government approval or license is needed and cannot be obtained at a reasonable cost within a reasonable
             period or otherwise sought, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute the foreign currency only to those ADS holders to
             whom it is possible to do so. It will hold or cause the custodian to hold the foreign currency it cannot convert for the account of the ADS
             holders who have not been paid and such funds will be held for the respective accounts of the ADS holders. It will not invest the foreign
             currency and it will not be liable for any interest for the respective accounts of the ADS holders.
              Before making a distribution, any taxes or other governmental charges, together with fees and expenses of the depositary, that must be
              paid, will be deducted. See “Taxation.” It will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round down fractional cents to the
              nearest whole cent. If the exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary cannot convert the foreign currency, you may lose
              some or all of the value of the distribution.
       •     Shares. For any Class Z ordinary shares we distribute as a dividend or free distribution, either (1) the depositary will distribute additional
             ADSs representing such Class Z ordinary shares or (2) existing ADSs as of the applicable record date will represent rights and interests in
             the additional Class Z ordinary shares distributed, to the extent reasonably practicable and permissible under law, in either case, net of
             applicable fees, charges and expenses incurred by the depositary and taxes and/or other governmental charges. The depositary will only
             distribute whole ADSs. It will try to sell Class Z ordinary shares which would require it to deliver a fractional ADS and distribute the net
             proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. The depositary may sell a portion of the distributed Class Z ordinary shares sufficient to pay
             its fees and expenses, and any taxes and governmental charges, in connection with that distribution.
       •     Elective Distributions in Cash or Shares. If we offer holders of our Class Z ordinary shares the option to receive dividends in either cash
             or shares, the depositary, after consultation with us and having received timely notice as described in the deposit agreement of such
             elective distribution by us, has discretion to determine to what extent such elective distribution will be made available to you as a holder of
             the ADSs. We must timely first instruct the depositary to make such elective distribution available to you and furnish it with satisfactory
             evidence that it is legal to do so. The depositary could decide it is not legal or reasonably practicable to make such elective distribution
             available to you. In such case, the depositary shall, on the basis of the same determination as is made in respect of the Class Z ordinary
             shares for which no election is made, distribute either cash in the same way as it does in a cash distribution, or additional ADSs
             representing Class Z ordinary shares in the same way as it does in a share distribution. The depositary is not obligated to make available to
             you a method to receive the elective dividend in shares rather than in ADSs. There can be no assurance that you will be given the
             opportunity to receive elective distributions on the same terms and conditions as the holders of Class Z ordinary shares.

                                                                             7
       •     Rights to Purchase Additional Shares. If we offer holders of our Class Z ordinary shares any rights to subscribe for additional shares, the
             depositary shall having received timely notice as described in the deposit agreement of such distribution by us, consult with us, and we
             must determine whether it is lawful and reasonably practicable to make these rights available to you. We must first instruct the depositary
             to make such rights available to you and furnish the depositary with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. If the depositary decides
             it is not legal or reasonably practicable to make the rights available but that it is lawful and reasonably practicable to sell the rights, the
             depositary will endeavor to sell the rights and in a riskless principal capacity or otherwise, at such place and upon such terms (including
             public or private sale) as it may deem proper distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash.
              The depositary will allow rights that are not distributed or sold to lapse. In that case, you will receive no value for them.
              If the depositary makes rights available to you, it will establish procedures to distribute such rights and enable you to exercise the rights
              upon your payment of applicable fees, charges and expenses incurred by the depositary and taxes and/or other governmental charges. The
              Depositary shall not be obliged to make available to you a method to exercise such rights to subscribe for Class Z ordinary shares (rather
              than ADSs).
              U.S. securities laws may restrict transfers and cancellation of the ADSs represented by shares purchased upon exercise of rights. For
              example, you may not be able to trade these ADSs freely in the United States. In this case, the depositary may deliver restricted depositary
              shares that have the same terms as the ADSs described in this section except for changes needed to put the necessary restrictions in place.
              There can be no assurance that you will be given the opportunity to exercise rights on the same terms and conditions as the holders of
              Class Z ordinary shares or be able to exercise such rights.
       •     Other Distributions. Subject to receipt of timely notice, as described in the deposit agreement, from us with the request to make any such
             distribution available to you, and provided the depositary has determined such distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable and
             feasible and in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will distribute to you anything else we distribute on
             deposited securities by any means it may deem practicable, upon your payment of applicable fees, charges and expenses incurred by the
             depositary and taxes and/or other governmental charges. If any of the conditions above are not met, the depositary will endeavor to sell, or
             cause to be sold, what we distributed and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash; or, if it is unable to sell such
             property, the depositary may dispose of such property in any way it deems reasonably practicable under the circumstances for nominal or
             no consideration, such that you may have no rights to or arising from such property.

       The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADS holders. We have no
obligation to register ADSs, shares, rights or other securities under the Securities Act. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the
distribution of ADSs, shares, rights or anything else to ADS holders. This means that you may not receive the distributions we make on our shares or
any value for them if we and/or the depositary determines that it is illegal or not practicable for us or the depositary to make them available to you.


Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation
How are ADSs issued?
       The depositary will deliver ADSs if you or your broker deposit Class Z ordinary shares or evidence of rights to receive Class Z ordinary shares
with the custodian. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary
will register the appropriate number of ADSs in the names you request and will deliver the ADSs to or upon the order of the person or persons entitled
thereto.

                                                                              8
      Except for Class Z ordinary shares deposited by us in connection with this offering, no shares will be accepted for deposit during a period of 180
days after the date of this prospectus. The 180 day lock up period is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances as described in the section entitled
“Shares Eligible for Future Sales—Lock-up Agreements.”


How do ADS holders cancel an American Depositary Share?
      You may turn in your ADSs at the depositary’s corporate trust office or by providing appropriate instructions to your broker. Upon payment of its
fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will deliver the Class Z ordinary shares
and any other deposited securities underlying the ADSs to you or a person you designate at the office of the custodian. Or, at your request, risk and
expense, the depositary will deliver the deposited securities at its corporate trust office, to the extent permitted by law.


How do ADS holders interchange between Certificated ADSs and Uncertificated ADSs?
      You may surrender your ADR to the depositary for the purpose of exchanging your ADR for uncertificated ADSs. The depositary will cancel that
ADR and will send you a statement confirming that you are the owner of uncertificated ADSs. Alternatively, upon receipt by the depositary of a proper
instruction from a holder of uncertificated ADSs requesting the exchange of uncertificated ADSs for certificated ADSs, the depositary will execute and
deliver to you an ADR evidencing those ADSs.


Voting Rights
How do you vote?
      You may instruct the depositary to vote the Class Z ordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying your ADSs at any meeting at which
you are entitled to vote pursuant to any applicable law, the provisions of our memorandum and articles of association, and the provisions of or governing
the deposited securities. Otherwise, you could exercise your right to vote directly if you withdraw the Class Z ordinary shares. However, you may not
know about the meeting sufficiently enough in advance to withdraw the Class Z ordinary shares.

       If we ask for your instructions and upon timely notice from us by regular, ordinary mail delivery, or by electronic transmission, as described in the
deposit agreement, the depositary will notify you of the upcoming meeting at which you are entitled to vote pursuant to any applicable law, the
provisions of our memorandum and articles of association, and the provisions of or governing the deposited securities, and arrange to deliver our voting
materials to you. The materials will include or reproduce (a) such notice of meeting or solicitation of consents or proxies; (b) a statement that the ADS
holders at the close of business on the ADS record date will be entitled, subject to any applicable law, the provisions of our memorandum and articles of
association, and the provisions of or governing the deposited securities, to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any, pertaining
to the Class Z ordinary shares or other deposited securities represented by such holder’s ADSs; and (c) a brief statement as to the manner in which such
instructions may be given or deemed given in accordance with the second to last sentence of this paragraph if no instruction is received, to the
depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us. Voting instructions may be given only in respect of a number of ADSs
representing an integral number of Class Z ordinary shares or other deposited securities. For instructions to be valid, the depositary must receive them in
writing on or before the date specified. The depositary will try, as far as practical, subject to applicable law and the provisions of our memorandum and
articles of association, to vote or to have its agents vote the Class Z ordinary shares or other deposited securities (in person or by proxy) as you instruct.
The depositary will only vote or attempt to vote as you instruct. If we timely requested the depositary to solicit your instructions but no instructions are
received by the depositary from an owner with respect to any of the deposited securities represented by the ADSs of that owner on or before the date
established by the depositary for such purpose, the depositary shall deem that owner to have instructed the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a
person designated by us with respect to such deposited securities, and the depositary shall give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us to vote
such deposited securities. However, no such instruction shall be deemed given and no such discretionary proxy shall be given with respect to any matter
if we inform the depositary we do not wish such proxy given, substantial opposition exists or the matter materially and adversely affects the rights of
holders of the Class Z ordinary shares.

                                                                               9
      We cannot assure you that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote the Class Z ordinary
shares underlying your ADSs. In addition, there can be no assurance that ADS holders and beneficial owners generally, or any holder or beneficial
owner in particular, will be given the opportunity to vote or cause the custodian to vote on the same terms and conditions as the holders of our Class Z
ordinary shares.

      The depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions.
This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you may have no recourse if the Class Z ordinary shares underlying your ADSs
are not voted as you requested.

      In order to give you a reasonable opportunity to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of voting rights relating to deposited securities, if we
request the depositary to act, we will give the depositary notice of any such meeting and details concerning the matters to be voted at least 30 business
days in advance of the meeting date.


Compliance with Regulations
Information Requests
       Each ADS holder and beneficial owner shall (a) provide such information as we or the depositary may request pursuant to law, including, without
limitation, relevant Cayman Islands law, any applicable law of the United States of America, our memorandum and articles of association, any
resolutions of our Board of Directors adopted pursuant to such memorandum and articles of association, the requirements of any markets or exchanges
upon which the Class Z ordinary shares, ADSs or ADRs are listed or traded, or to any requirements of any electronic book-entry system by which the
ADSs or ADRs may be transferred, regarding the capacity in which they own or owned ADRs, the identity of any other persons then or previously
interested in such ADRs and the nature of such interest, and any other applicable matters, and (b) be bound by and subject to applicable provisions of the
laws of the Cayman Islands, our memorandum and articles of association, and the requirements of any markets or exchanges upon which the ADSs,
ADRs or Class Z ordinary shares are listed or traded, or pursuant to any requirements of any electronic book-entry system by which the ADSs, ADRs or
Class Z ordinary shares may be transferred, to the same extent as if such ADS holder or beneficial owner held Class Z ordinary shares directly, in each
case irrespective of whether or not they are ADS holders or beneficial owners at the time such request is made.


Disclosure of Interests
      Each ADS holder and beneficial owner shall comply with our requests pursuant to Cayman Islands law, the rules and requirements of the New
York Stock Exchange and any other stock exchange on which the Class Z ordinary shares are, or will be, registered, traded or listed or our memorandum
and articles of association, which requests are made to provide information, inter alia, as to the capacity in which such ADS holder or beneficial owner
owns ADS and regarding the identity of any other person interested in such ADS and the nature of such interest and various other matters, whether or
not they are ADS holders or beneficial owners at the time of such requests.


Payment of Taxes
       You will be responsible for any taxes or other governmental charges payable, or which become payable, on your ADSs or on the deposited
securities represented by any of your ADSs. The depositary may refuse to register or transfer your ADSs or allow you to withdraw the deposited
securities represented by your ADSs until such taxes or other charges are paid. It may apply payments owed to you or sell deposited securities
represented by your ADSs to pay any taxes owed and you will remain liable for any deficiency. If the depositary sells deposited securities, it will, if
appropriate, reduce the number of ADSs to reflect the sale and pay to you any net proceeds, or send to you any property, remaining after it has paid the
taxes. You agree to indemnify us, the depositary, the custodian and each of our and their respective agents, directors, employees and affiliates for, and
hold each of them harmless from, any claims with respect to taxes (including applicable interest and penalties thereon) arising from any refund of taxes,
reduced rate of withholding at source or other tax benefit obtained for you. Your obligations under this paragraph shall survive any transfer of ADRs,
any surrender of ADRs and withdrawal of deposited securities or the termination of the deposit agreement.

                                                                             10
Reclassifications, Recapitalizations and Mergers

If we:                                                                              Then:
Change the nominal or par value of our Class Z ordinary shares                      The cash, shares or other securities received by the depositary will
                                                                                    become deposited securities.
Reclassify, split up or consolidate any of the deposited securities                 Each ADS will automatically represent its equal share of the new
                                                                                    deposited securities.
Distribute securities on the Class Z ordinary shares that are not distributed to    The depositary may distribute some or all of the cash, shares or other
you, or Recapitalize, reorganize, merge, liquidate, sell all or substantially all   securities it received. It may also deliver new ADSs or ask you to
of our assets, or take any similar action                                           surrender your outstanding ADRs in exchange for new ADRs identifying
                                                                                    the new deposited securities.

Amendment and Termination
How may the deposit agreement be amended?
      We may agree with the depositary to amend the deposit agreement and the form of ADR without your consent for any reason. If an amendment
adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes and other governmental charges or expenses of the depositary for registration fees, facsimile costs,
delivery charges or similar items, including expenses incurred in connection with foreign exchange control regulations and other charges specifically
payable by ADS holders under the deposit agreement, or materially prejudices a substantial existing right of ADS holders, it will not become effective
for outstanding ADSs until 30 days after the depositary notifies ADS holders of the amendment. At the time an amendment becomes effective, you are
considered, by continuing to hold your ADSs, to agree to the amendment and to be bound by the ADRs and the deposit agreement as amended. If any
new laws are adopted which would require the deposit agreement to be amended in order to comply therewith, we and the depositary may amend the
deposit agreement in accordance with such laws and such amendment may become effective before notice thereof is given to ADS holders.


How may the deposit agreement be terminated?
      The depositary will terminate the deposit agreement if we ask it to do so, in which case the depositary will give notice to you at least 90 days prior
to termination. The depositary may also terminate the deposit agreement if the depositary has told us that it would like to resign, or if we have removed
the depositary, and in either case we have not appointed a new depositary within 90 days. In either such case, the depositary must notify you at least 30
days before termination.

       After termination, the depositary and its agents will do the following under the deposit agreement but nothing else: collect distributions on the
deposited securities, sell rights and other property and deliver Class Z ordinary shares and other deposited securities upon cancellation of ADSs after
payment of any fees, charges, taxes or other governmental charges. Six months or more after the date of termination, the depositary may sell any
remaining deposited securities by public or private sale. After that, the depositary will hold the money it received on the sale, as well as any other cash it
is holding under the deposit agreement, for the pro rata benefit of the ADS holders that have not surrendered their ADSs. It will not invest the money
and has no liability for interest. After such sale, the depositary’s only obligations will be to account for the money and other cash. After termination, we
shall be discharged from all obligations under the deposit agreement except for our obligations to the depositary thereunder.


Books of Depositary
      The depositary will maintain ADS holder records at its depositary office. You may inspect such records at such office during regular business
hours but solely for the purpose of communicating with other holders in the interest of business matters relating to the Company, the ADRs and the
deposit agreement.

     The depositary will maintain facilities in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York to record and process the issuance, cancellation,
combination, split-up and transfer of ADRs.

                                                                               11
      These facilities may be closed at any time or from time to time when such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the depositary in connection
with the performance of its duties under the deposit agreement or at our reasonable written request.


Limitations on Obligations and Liability
Limits on our Obligations and the Obligations of the Depositary and the Custodian; Limits on Liability to Holders of ADSs
       The deposit agreement expressly limits our obligations and the obligations of the depositary and the custodian. It also limits our liability and the
liability of the depositary. The depositary and the custodian:
       •      are only obligated to take the actions specifically set forth in the deposit agreement without gross negligence or willful misconduct;
       •      are not liable if any of us or our respective controlling persons or agents are prevented or forbidden from, or subjected to any civil or
              criminal penalty or restraint on account of, or delayed in, doing or performing any act or thing required by the terms of the deposit
              agreement and any ADR, by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation of the United States or any state thereof, the
              Cayman Islands or any other country, or of any other governmental authority or regulatory authority or stock exchange, or on account of
              the possible criminal or civil penalties or restraint, or by reason of any provision, present or future, of our memorandum and articles of
              association or any provision of or governing any deposited securities, or by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstances beyond
              its control (including, without limitation, nationalization, expropriation, currency restrictions, work stoppage, strikes, civil unrest,
              revolutions, rebellions, explosions and computer failure);
       •      are not liable by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in the deposit agreement or in our
              memorandum and articles of association or provisions of or governing deposited securities;
       •      are not liable for any action or inaction of the depositary, the custodian or us or their or our respective controlling persons or agents in
              reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, any person presenting Class Z ordinary shares for deposit or any other
              person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information;
       •      are not liable for the inability of any holder of ADSs to benefit from any distribution on deposited securities that is not made available to
              holders of ADSs under the terms of the deposit agreement;
       •      are not liable for any special, consequential, indirect or punitive damages for any breach of the terms of the deposit agreement, or
              otherwise;
       •      may rely upon any documents we believe in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party;
       •      disclaim any liability for any action or inaction or inaction of any of us or our respective controlling persons or agents in reliance upon the
              advice of or information from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting Class Z ordinary shares for deposit, holders and beneficial
              owners (or authorized representatives) of ADSs, or any person believed in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information;
              and
       •      disclaim any liability for inability of any holder to benefit from any distribution, offering, right or other benefit made available to holders
              of deposited securities but not made available to holders of ADS.

       The depositary and any of its agents also disclaim any liability (i) for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, the manner in which any
vote is cast or the effect of any vote or failure to determine that any distribution or action may be lawful or reasonably practicable or for allowing any
rights to lapse in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement, (ii) the failure or timeliness of any notice from us, the content of any
information submitted to it by us for distribution to you or for any inaccuracy of any translation thereof, (iii) any investment risk associated with the
acquisition of an interest in the deposited securities, the validity or worth of the deposited securities, the credit¬worthiness of any third party, (iv) for any
tax consequences that may result from ownership of ADSs, Class Z ordinary shares or deposited securities, or (v) for any acts or omissions made by a
successor depositary whether in connection with a previous act or omission of the depositary or in connection with any matter arising wholly after the
removal or resignation of the depositary, provided that in connection with the issue out of which such potential liability arises the depositary performed
its obligations without gross negligence or willful misconduct while it acted as depositary.

                                                                               12
      In addition, the deposit agreement provides that each party to the deposit agreement (including each holder, beneficial owner and holder of
interests in the ADRs) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in any lawsuit or
proceeding against the depositary or Bilibili related to its shares, the ADSs or the deposit agreement.

      In the deposit agreement, we and the depositary agree to indemnify each other under certain circumstances.


Requirements for Depositary Actions
     Before the depositary will issue, deliver or register a transfer of an ADS, split-up, subdivide or combine ADSs, make a distribution on an ADS, or
permit withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares, the depositary may require:
       •     payment of stock transfer or other taxes or other governmental charges and transfer or registration fees charged by third parties for the
             transfer of any Class Z ordinary shares or other deposited securities and payment of the applicable fees, expenses and charges of the
             depositary;
       •     satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or any other matters contemplated in the deposit agreement; and
       •     compliance with (A) any laws or governmental regulations relating to the execution and delivery of ADRs or ADSs or to the withdrawal or
             delivery of deposited securities and (B) such reasonable regulations and procedures as the depositary may establish, from time to time,
             consistent with the deposit agreement and applicable laws, including presentation of transfer documents.

     The depositary may refuse to issue and deliver ADSs or register transfers of ADSs generally when the register of the depositary or our transfer
books are closed or at any time if the depositary or we determine that it is necessary or advisable to do so.


Your Right to Receive the Shares Underlying Your ADSs
      You have the right to cancel your ADSs and withdraw the underlying Class Z ordinary shares at any time except:
       •     when temporary delays arise because: (1) the depositary has closed its transfer books or we have closed our transfer books; (2) the transfer
             of Class Z ordinary shares is blocked to permit voting at a shareholders’ meeting; or (3) we are paying a dividend on our Class Z ordinary
             shares;
       •     when you owe money to pay fees, taxes and similar charges;
       •     when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs or to the
             withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares or other deposited securities, or
       •     other circumstances specifically contemplated by Section I.A.(l) of the General Instructions to Form F-6 (as such General Instructions may
             be amended from time to time); or
       •     for any other reason if the depositary or we determine, in good faith, that it is necessary or advisable to prohibit withdrawals.

                                                                             13
      The depositary shall not knowingly accept for deposit under the deposit agreement any Class Z ordinary shares or other deposited securities
required to be registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, unless a registration statement is in effect as to such Class Z ordinary shares.

      This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the deposit agreement.


Direct Registration System
       In the deposit agreement, all parties to the deposit agreement acknowledge that the DRS and Profile Modification System, or Profile, will apply to
uncertificated ADSs upon acceptance thereof to DRS by DTC. DRS is the system administered by DTC pursuant to which the depositary may register
the ownership of uncertificated ADSs, which ownership shall be evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the ADS holders entitled
thereto. Profile is a required feature of DRS which allows a DTC participant, claiming to act on behalf of an ADS holder, to direct the depositary to
register a transfer of those ADSs to DTC or its nominee and to deliver those ADSs to the DTC account of that DTC participant without receipt by the
depositary of prior authorization from the ADS holder to register such transfer.


Conversion between Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong and ADSs (Item 12.D.1 and 12.D.2 of Form 20-F)
Dealings and Settlement of Class Z Ordinary Shares in Hong Kong
      Our Class Z ordinary shares now trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in board lots of 20 ordinary shares. Dealings in our Class Z ordinary

             and

             another, each share certificate canceled or issued by it and any applicable fee as stated in the share transfer forms used in Hong Kong.

       Investors must settle their trades executed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through their brokers directly or through custodians. For an investor
who has deposited his or her Class Z ordinary shares in his or her stock account or in his or her designated CCASS participant’s stock account
maintained with CCASS, settlement will be effected in CCASS in accordance with the General Rules of CCASS and CCASS Operational Procedures in
effect from time to time. For an investor who holds the physical certificates, settlement certificates and the duly executed transfer forms must be
delivered to his or her broker or custodian before the settlement date.

                                                                             14
Conversion between Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong and ADSs
      In connection with the listing of our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we have established a branch register of
members in Hong Kong, or the Hong Kong share register, which is maintained by our Hong Kong Share Registrar, Computershare Hong Kong Investor
Services Limited. Our principal register of members, or the Cayman share register, continues to be maintained by our Principal Share Registrar, Walkers
Corporate Limited.

       All Class Z ordinary shares offered in the Global Offering are registered on the Hong Kong share register in order to be listed and traded on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As described in further detail below, holders of Class Z ordinary shares registered on the Hong Kong share register are
able to convert these shares into ADSs, and vice versa.

     In connection with our listing in Hong Kong, and to facilitate fungibility and conversion between ADSs and Class Z ordinary shares and trading
between Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we have moved a portion of our issued Class Z ordinary shares from our register of members
maintained in the Cayman Islands to our Hong Kong share register.


      Our ADSs
      Our ADSs are traded on the Nasdaq. Dealings in our ADSs on the Nasdaq are conducted in U.S. Dollars.

      ADSs may be held either:
       •     directly (a) by having an American Depositary Receipt (ADR), which is a certificate evidencing a specific number of ADSs, registered in
             the holder’s name, or (b) by holding uncertificated ADSs in the direct registration system; or
       •     indirectly, through the holder’s broker or other financial institution.

     The depositary for our ADSs is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, whose office is located at 1 Columbus Circle, 17th Floor, New York,
NY 10019, USA.


Converting Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong into ADSs
     An investor who holds Class Z ordinary shares registered in Hong Kong and who intends to convert them to ADSs to trade on the Nasdaq must
deposit or have his or her broker deposit the Class Z ordinary shares with the depositary’s Hong Kong custodian, Deutsche Bank AG, Hong Kong
Branch, or the custodian, in exchange for ADSs.

      A deposit of Class Z ordinary shares trading in Hong Kong in exchange for ADSs involves the following procedures:
       •     If Class Z ordinary shares have been deposited with CCASS, the investor must transfer ordinary shares to the depositary’s account with the
             custodian within CCASS by following the CCASS procedures for transfer and submit and deliver a duly completed and signed letter of
             transmittal to the custodian via his or her broker.
       •     If Class Z ordinary shares are held outside CCASS, the investor must arrange to deposit his or her Class Z ordinary shares into CCASS for
             delivery to the depositary’s account with the custodian within CCASS, submit and deliver a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal
             to the custodian.
       •     Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, if applicable, and
             subject in all cases to the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will issue the corresponding number of ADSs in the name(s)
             requested by an investor and will deliver the ADSs to the designated DTC account of the person(s) designated by an investor or his or her
             broker.

                                                                              15
      For Class Z ordinary shares deposited in CCASS, under normal circumstances, the above steps generally require two business days, provided that
the investor has provided timely and complete instructions. For Class Z ordinary shares held outside CCASS in physical form, the above steps may take
14 business days, or more, to complete. Temporary delays may arise. For example, the transfer books of the depositary may from time to time be closed
to ADS issuances. The investor will be unable to trade the ADSs until the procedures are completed.


Converting ADSs to Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong
       An investor who holds ADSs and who intends to convert his/her ADSs into Class Z ordinary shares to trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
must cancel the ADSs the investor holds and withdraw Class Z ordinary shares from our ADS program and cause his or her broker or other financial
institution to trade such Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

      An investor that holds ADSs indirectly through a broker should follow the broker’s procedure and instruct the broker to arrange for cancelation of
the ADSs, and transfer of the underlying Class Z ordinary shares from the depositary’s account with the custodian within the CCASS system to the
investor’s Hong Kong stock account.

      For investors holding ADSs directly, the following steps must be taken:
       •     To withdraw Class Z ordinary shares from our ADS program, an investor who holds ADSs may turn in such ADSs at the office of the
             depositary (and the applicable ADR(s) if the ADSs are held in certificated form), and send an instruction to cancel such ADSs to the
             depositary. Such instructions must have a Medallion signature guarantee.
       •     Upon payment or net of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, if applicable,
             and subject in all cases to the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will instruct the custodian to deliver Class Z ordinary shares
             underlying the canceled ADSs to the CCASS account designated by an investor.
       •     If an investor prefers to receive Class Z ordinary shares outside CCASS, he or she must receive ordinary shares in CCASS first and then
             arrange for withdrawal from CCASS. Investors can then obtain a transfer form signed by HKSCC Nominees Limited (as the transferor)
             and register Class Z ordinary shares in their own names with the Hong Kong Share Registrar.

       For Class Z ordinary shares to be received in CCASS, under normal circumstances, the above steps generally require two business days, provided
that the investor has provided timely and complete instructions. For Class Z ordinary shares to be received outside CCASS in physical form, the above
steps may take 14 business days, or more, to complete. The investor will be unable to trade the Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange until the procedures are completed.

       Temporary delays may arise. For example, the transfer books of the depositary may from time to time be closed to ADS cancellations. In addition,
completion of the above steps and procedures is subject to there being a sufficient number of Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong share registar to
facilitate a withdrawal from the ADS program directly into the CCASS system. We are not under any obligation to maintain or increase the number of
Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong share register to facilitate such withdrawals.


Depositary Requirements
      Before the depositary issues ADSs or permits withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares, the depositary may require:
       •     production of satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or other information it deems necessary; and

                                                                           16
       •     compliance with procedures it may establish, from time to time, consistent with the deposit agreement, including, but not limited to,
             completion and presentation of transfer documents.

      The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer, or register issuances, transfers and cancelations of ADSs generally when the transfer books of the
depositary or our Hong Kong or Cayman Share Registrar are closed or at any time if the depositary or we determine it advisable to do so, subject to such
refusal complying with U.S. federal securities laws.

       All costs attributable to the transfer of Class Z ordinary shares to effect a withdrawal from or deposit of Class Z ordinary shares into our ADS
program will be borne by the investor requesting the transfer. In particular, holders of Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs should note that the Hong Kong
Share Registrar will charge between HK$2.50 to HK$20, depending on the speed of service (or such higher fee as may from time to time be permitted
under the Hong Kong Listing Rules), for each transfer of Class Z ordinary shares from one registered owner to another, each share certificate canceled
or issued by it and any applicable fee as stated in the share transfer forms used in Hong Kong. In addition, holders of Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs
must pay up to US$5.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs for each issuance of ADSs and each cancelation of ADSs, as the case may be, in connection with the
deposit of Class Z ordinary shares into, or withdrawal of ordinary shares from, our ADS program.

                                                                           17
                                                                                                                                                  Exhibit 4.5

                                                                     Power of Attorney

      Attorney in lieu of the Original Power of Attorney.

I hereby irrevocably authorize the Attorney to exercise the rights hereunder within the term hereof.

     2)    exercising the rights of shareholders to vote, to appoint directors and amend the articles of association I am entitled to according to the

           administrative or judicial authority of Mainland China prior to or after the signing of this Power of Attorney, hereinafter referred to as the

     5)    signing the minutes of the meeting, written resolutions and/or other relevant documents of the shareholders’ meeting and filing the
           documents with the competent administration for market regulation and any other governmental authority.


2.   Representations and Warranties Related to the Entrusted Rights
     2.1   I undertake not to engage in any action in violation of the purpose or intention of this Power of Attorney nor use the information obtained
           from the Attorney to cause the conflict between the interest of the Attorney and its shareholders.
     2.2   I undertake that the authorization hereunder will not lead to a real or potential conflict of interest between me and the Attorney. If there is a
           potential conflict of interest between me and the Attorney or the direct or indirect overseas parent company of the Attorney or any other
           subsidiary of such overseas parent company, without conflict with the PRC Laws, I will give a priority to the protection and will not harm
           the interests of the Attorney or the direct or indirect overseas parent company of the Attorney. In the event that I am a director or senior
           management officer of the Attorney or direct or indirect overseas parent company of the Attorney, I will authorize the Attorney or, at the
           direction of the Attorney, any other director or senior management officer other than me to exercise the rights hereunder.
     2.3   I undertake that, without the prior written consent of the Attorney, I will not, in any way, directly or indirectly participate in, engage in any
           business that has or may compete with the business of the Attorney, the Company and any company under the control of the Attorney or
           the Company, or hold the rights, interests and assets of any relevant entity that has or may have a competitive business with the Attorney,
           the Company and any company under the control of the Attorney or the Company, and that the Attorney will have the right to ultimately
           determine whether or not I have or may have any of the above circumstances.

                                                                            2
     2.4   I hereby undertake that, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company, all the assets, including the
           equity of the Company, acquired by me after the bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company, will be transferred to
           the Attorney or the party designated by the Attorney free of charge or at the lowest price permitted by Chinese law at that time or will be
           disposed of by the liquidator at that time on the basis of the protection of the interests of the direct or indirect shareholders and/or creditors
           of the Attorney.
     2.5   I agree that the Attorney will have the right to entrust the Trustees with matters under Article 1 hereof. The Trustees and/or the Attorney
           exercise the Entrusted Rights as I personally exercise the rights of shareholders. The authorization and entrustment of such Entrusted
           Rights shall be based on the precondition that the person designated by the Attorney is the director of its direct or indirect overseas parent
           company and the liquidator or other successor acting as such director, and I agree to the above authorization and entrustment. When the
           Attorney gives me a written notice to replace the Trustees, I will immediately appoint other entities or Chinese citizens designated by the
           Attorney and to the satisfaction of the Trustees at that time to exercise the above Entrusted Rights. The new authorization in line with this
           Power of Attorney may replace the original authorization once it is made. In addition, I will not revoke the entrustment and authorization
           made to the Trustees and/or the Attorney.
     2.6   I will acknowledge and approve any legal consequence arising from the exercise of the above Entrusted Rights by the Trustees and/or the
           Attorney in accordance with this Power of Attorney and will bear the corresponding legal liability.
     2.7   All the actions of the Trustees and/or the Attorney relating to the equity of the Company and/or the other Entrusted Rights shall be the
           actions of mine. All the meeting minutes and resolutions of the shareholders’ meeting or shareholder’s decisions, as appropriate, signed by
           the Trustees and/or the Attorney shall be deemed to be signed by me. The Trustees and/or the Attorney may act according to their own will
           without prior consent of mine, but after the resolution of the shareholders’ meeting or the decision of the shareholder (as the case may be),
           the Trustees and/or the Attorney shall inform me in time. I hereby acknowledge and approve such acts and/or documents of the Trustees
           and/or the Attorney.
     2.8   During the term of this Power of Attorney, I agree and acknowledge that I will not exercise all the rights relating to the equity of the
           Company authorized to the Trustees and/or the Attorney herein without the prior written consent of the Attorney.
     2.9   In the event of divorce, incapacity, declared disappearance/death, death, bankruptcy or any other occurrence that may affect the exercise of
           the Company’s equity rights held by me, the shareholder or transferee holding the original Target Equity of mine shall be deemed to be a
           party hereto, inheriting/assuming all my rights and obligations hereunder.


3.   Entrustment Term
     3.1   This Power of Attorney shall take effect from the execution date and shall be irrevocable and shall remain in force unless the Attorney
           gives the contrary written instruction, or this Power of Attorney terminates in accordance with Article 3.2 hereof.

                                                                            3
     3.2   This Power of Attorney will be automatically terminated on the date on which the Attorney or the relevant party designated by the
           Attorney is registered as the sole shareholder of the Company, once the PRC Laws allow the Attorney or the Attorney’s direct or indirect
           overseas parent company or a subsidiary directly or indirectly controlled by the Attorney’s foreign parent company to directly hold shares
           in the Company and legally engage in the Company’s business.


4.   Applicable Law and Dispute Settlement
     4.1   The execution, effectiveness, interpretation, performance, modification and termination of this Power of Attorney and the settlement of
           disputes hereunder shall be governed by the PRC Laws.
     4.2   Any dispute arising from the interpretation and performance hereof shall be first settled through friendly negotiation among the Attorney
           and I. If the Attorney and I fail to reach an agreement on the settlement of such dispute within thirty (30) days after any Party requests the
           other Parties to settle such dispute through negotiation, any Party may submit such dispute to China International Economic and Trade
           Arbitration Commission for arbitration in accordance with the arbitration rules in force at that time. The arbitration shall be conducted in
           Beijing and the language of arbitration shall be Chinese. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the Attorney and I. After the
           arbitral award comes into effect, any Party shall have the right to apply to the competent court for enforcement of the arbitral award. The
           arbitral tribunal may rule on the Company’s equity interests, assets or property interests as the compensation or satisfaction to the Attorney
           for the losses caused by the breach of contract hereunder, rule on injunctive relief in respect of the relevant business or asset transfer, or
           order the Company to carry out bankruptcy liquidation. After the arbitral award comes into effect, any Party shall have the right to apply to

                                            AMENDED CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS

                             (Adopted by the Board of Directors of Bilibili Inc. on February 27, 2018, effective upon the
                             effectiveness of its registration statement on Form F-1 relating to its initial public offering,
                                                            and as amended on July 24, 2021)


I.    PURPOSE
      This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) contains general guidelines for conducting the business of Bilibili Inc. and its subsidiaries
and affiliates (collectively, the “Company”) consistent with the highest standards of business ethics, and is intended to qualify as a “code of ethics”
within the meaning of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. To the extent this Code requires a higher
standard than required by commercial practice or applicable laws, rules or regulations, the Company adheres to these higher standards.

      This Code is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
       •      honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
              relationships;
       •      full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the U.S.
              Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and in other public communications
              made by the Company;
       •      compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;
       •      prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code; and
       •      accountability for adherence to the Code.


II.   APPLICABILITY
      This Code applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company, whether they work for the Company on a full-time, part-time,
consultative or temporary basis (each, an “employee” and collectively, the “employees”). Certain provisions of the Code apply specifically to our chief
executive officer, chief financial officer, other chief officers, senior financial officer, controller, senior vice presidents, vice presidents and any other
persons who perform similar functions for the Company (each, a “senior officer,” and collectively, the “senior officers”).

      The Board of Directors of Bilibili Inc. (the “Board”) has appointed the head of the Legal Department of Bilibili Inc. as the Compliance Officer for
the Company (the “Compliance Officer”). If you have any questions regarding the Code or would like to report any violation of the Code, please
contact the Compliance Officer by email at complianceofficer@bilibili.com.
III. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Identifying Conflicts of Interest
      A conflict of interest occurs when an employee’s private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, in any way with the interests of the Company
as a whole. An employee should actively avoid any private interest that may impact such employee’s ability to act in the interests of the Company or
that may make it difficult to perform the employee’s work objectively and effectively. In general, the following are considered conflicts of interest:
       •     Competing Business. No employee may be employed by a business that competes with the Company or deprives it of any business.
       •     Corporate Opportunity. No employee may use corporate property, information or his/her position with the Company to secure a business
             opportunity that would otherwise be available to the Company. If an employee discovers a business opportunity that is in the Company’s
             line of business through the use of the Company’s property, information or position, the employee must first present the business
             opportunity to the Company before pursuing the opportunity in his/her individual capacity.
       •     Financial Interests.
                    (i)     No employee may have any financial interest (ownership or otherwise), either directly or indirectly through a spouse or other
                            family member, in any other business or entity if such interest adversely affects the employee’s performance of duties or
                            responsibilities to the Company, or requires the employee to devote time to it during such employee’s working hours at the
                            Company;
                    (ii)    No employee may hold any ownership interest in a privately held company that is in competition with the Company;
                    (iii)   An employee may hold less than 5% ownership interest in a publicly traded company that is in competition with the
                            Company; provided that if the employee’s ownership interest in such publicly traded company increases to 5% or more, the
                            employee must immediately report such ownership to the Compliance Officer;
                    (iv)    Unless pre-approved by the Compliance Officer, no employee may hold any ownership interest in a company that has a
                            business relationship with the Company if such employee’s duties at the Company include managing or supervising the
                            Company’s business relations with that company; and
                    (v)     Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Code,
                            (a) a director or any family member of such director (collectively, “Director Affiliates”) or a senior officer or any family
                            member of such senior officer (collectively, “Officer Affiliates”) may continue to hold his/her investment or other financial
                            interest in a business or entity (an “Interested Business”) that:
                 (1)   was made or obtained either (x) before the Company invested in or otherwise became interested in such business or
                       entity; or (y) before the director or senior officer joined the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of
                       whether the Company had or had not already invested in or otherwise become interested in such business or entity at
                       the time the director or senior officer joined the Company); or
                 (2)   may in the future be made or obtained by the director or senior officer, provided that at the time such investment or
                       other financial interest is made or obtained, the Company has not yet invested in or otherwise become interested in
                       such business or entity;
                 provided that such director or senior officer shall disclose such investment or other financial interest to the Board;
                 (b) an interested director or senior officer shall refrain from participating in any discussion among senior officers of the
                 Company relating to an Interested Business and may not be involved in any proposed transaction between the Company and
                 an Interested Business; and
                 (c) before any Director Affiliate or Officer Affiliate (i) invests, or otherwise acquires any equity or other financial interest, in
                 a business or entity that is in competition with the Company; or (ii) enters into any transaction with the Company, the related
                 director or senior officer shall obtain prior approval from the Audit Committee of the Board.
    For purposes of this Code, a company or other entity is deemed to be “in competition with the Company” if it competes with the
    Company’s online entertainment-related services, including but not limited to, video streaming services, mobile game services, live
    broadcasting services and advertising services, and any other business in which the Company engages in.
•   Loans or Other Financial Transactions. No employee may obtain loans or guarantees of personal obligations from, or enter into any other
    personal financial transaction with, any company that is a material customer, supplier or competitor of the Company. This guideline does
    not prohibit arms-length transactions with recognized banks or other financial institutions.
•   Service on Boards and Committees. No employee may serve on a board of directors or trustees or on a committee of any entity (whether
    profit or not-for-profit) whose interests could reasonably be expected to conflict with those of the Company. Employees must obtain prior
    approval from the Board before accepting any such board or committee position. The Company may revisit its approval of any such
    position at any time to determine whether an employee’s service in such position is still appropriate.
      The above is in no way a complete list of situations where conflicts of interest may arise. The following questions might serve as a useful guide in
assessing a potential conflict of interest situation not specifically addressed above:
       •     Is the action to be taken legal?
       •     Is it honest and fair?
       •     Is it in the best interests of the Company?


Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest
      The Company requires that employees fully disclose any situations that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. If an
employee suspects that he/she has a conflict of interest, or a situation that others could reasonably perceive as a conflict of interest, the employee must
report it immediately to the Compliance Officer. Conflicts of interest may only be waived by the Board, or the appropriate committee of the Board, and
will be promptly disclosed to the public to the extent required by law and applicable rules of the applicable stock exchange.


Family Members and Work
       The actions of family members outside the workplace may also give rise to conflicts of interest because they may influence an employee’s
objectivity in making decisions on behalf of the Company. If a member of an employee’s family is interested in doing business with the Company, the
criteria as to whether to enter into or continue the business relationship and the terms and conditions of the relationship must be no less favorable to the
Company compared with those that would apply to an unrelated party seeking to do business with the Company under similar circumstances.

       Employees are required to report any situation involving family members that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest to
their supervisor or the Compliance Officer. For purposes of this Code, “family members” or “members of employee’s family” include an employee’s
spouse, parents, children and siblings, whether by blood, marriage or adoption or anyone residing in such employee’s home.


IV.   GIFTS, MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT
      All employees are required to comply with the anti-corruption compliance policy of the Company regarding gifts, meals and entertainment.


V.    PROTECTION AND USE OF COMPANY ASSETS
      Employees should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use for legitimate business purposes only. Theft, carelessness and waste
have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability. Any use of the funds or assets of the Company, whether for personal gain or not, for any unlawful
or improper purpose is strictly prohibited.
      To ensure the protection and proper use of the Company’s assets, each employee is required to:
       •     Exercise reasonable care to prevent theft, damage or misuse of Company property;
       •     Promptly report any actual or suspected theft, damage or misuse of Company property;
       •     Safeguard all electronic programs, data, communications and written materials from unauthorized access; and
       •     Use Company property only for legitimate business purposes.

      Except as approved in advance by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company, the Company prohibits political
contributions (directly or through trade associations) by any employee on behalf of the Company. Prohibited political contributions include:
       •     any contributions of the Company’s funds or other assets for political purposes;
       •     encouraging individual employees to make any such contribution; and
       •     reimbursing an employee for any political contribution.


VI.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
      Employees shall abide by the Company’s rules and policies in protecting the intellectual property and confidential information, including the
following:
       •     All inventions, creative works, computer software, and technical or trade secrets developed by an employee in the course of performing the
             employee’s duties or primarily through the use of the Company’s assets or resources while working at the Company are the property of the
             Company.
       •     Employees shall maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company or entities with which the Company has
             business relations, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information
             that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the company or its business associates, if disclosed.
       •     The Company maintains a strict confidentiality policy. During an employee’s term of employment with the Company, the employee shall
             comply with any and all written or unwritten rules and policies concerning confidentiality and shall fulfill the duties and responsibilities
             concerning confidentiality applicable to the employee.
       •     In addition to fulfilling the responsibilities associated with his/her position in the Company, an employee may not, without obtaining prior
             approval from the Company, disclose, announce or publish trade secrets or other confidential business information of the Company, nor
             may an employee use such confidential information outside the course of his/her duties to the Company.
       •     Even outside the work environment, an employee must maintain vigilance and refrain from disclosing important information regarding the
             Company or its business, business associates or employees.
       •     An employee’s duty of confidentiality with respect to the confidential information of the Company survives the termination of such
             employee’s employment with the Company for any reason until such time as the Company discloses such information publicly or the
             information otherwise becomes available in the public sphere through no fault of the employee.
       •     Upon termination of employment, or at such time as the Company requests, an employee must return to the Company all of its property
             without exception, including all forms of medium containing confidential information, and may not retain duplicate materials.


VII. ACCURACY OF FINANCIAL REPORTS AND OTHER PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS
       The Company is required to report its financial results and other material information about its business to the public and the SEC. It is the
Company’s policy to promptly disclose accurate and complete information regarding its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employees must strictly comply with all applicable standards, laws, regulations and policies for accounting and financial reporting of transactions,
estimates and forecasts. Inaccurate, incomplete or untimely reporting will not be tolerated and can severely damage the Company and result in legal
liability.

       Employees should be on guard for, and are required to promptly report, any possibility of inaccurate or incomplete financial reporting. Particular
attention should be paid to:
       •     Financial results that seem inconsistent with the performance of the underlying business;
       •     Transactions that do not seem to have an obvious business purpose; and
       •     Requests to circumvent ordinary review and approval procedures.

      The Company’s senior financial officers and other employees working in the finance department have a special responsibility to ensure that all of
the Company’s financial disclosures are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable. These individuals are required to report any practice or situation
that might undermine this objective to the Compliance Officer.

      Employees are prohibited from directly or indirectly taking any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence the Company’s
independent auditors for the purpose of rendering the financial statements of the Company materially misleading. Prohibited actions include but are not
limited to:
       •     issuing or reissuing a report on the Company’s financial statements that is not warranted in the circumstances (due to material violations of
             U.S. GAAP, generally accepted auditing standards or other professional or regulatory standards);
       •     not performing audit, review or other procedures required by generally accepted auditing standards or other professional standards;
       •     not withdrawing an issued report when withdrawal is warranted under the circumstances; or
       •     not communicating matters as required to the Company’s Audit Committee.


VIII. COMPANY RECORDS
      Accurate and reliable records are crucial to the Company’s business and form the basis of its earnings statements, financial reports and other
disclosures to the public. The Company’s records are a source of essential data that guides business decision-making and strategic planning. Company
records include, but are not limited to, booking information, payroll, timecards, travel and expense reports, e-mails, accounting and financial data,
measurement and performance records, electronic data files and all other records maintained in the ordinary course of business.

      All Company records must be complete, accurate and reliable in all material respects. There is never an acceptable reason to make false or
misleading entries. Undisclosed or unrecorded funds, payments or receipts are strictly prohibited. An employee is responsible for understanding and
complying with the Company’s recordkeeping policy. An employee should contact the Compliance Officer if he/she has any questions regarding the
recordkeeping policy.


IX.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS
      Each employee has an obligation to comply with the laws of the cities, provinces, regions and countries in which the Company operates. This
includes, without limitation, laws covering commercial bribery and kickbacks, patent, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, information privacy,
insider trading, offering or receiving gratuities, employment harassment, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, false or misleading
financial information, misuse of corporate assets and foreign currency exchange activities. Employees are expected to understand and comply with all
laws, rules and regulations that apply to their positions at the Company. If any doubt exists about whether a course of action is lawful, the employee
should seek advice immediately from the Compliance Officer.


X.    DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT
      The Company is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or
harassment based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, national origin or any other protected class. For further information, employees should consult
the Compliance Officer.
XI.   FAIR DEALING
      Each employee should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No employee may take
unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair-
dealing practice.


XII. HEALTH AND SAFETY
      The Company strives to provide employees with a safe and healthy work environment. Each employee has responsibility for maintaining a safe
and healthy workplace for other employees by following environmental, safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries and
unsafe equipment, practices or conditions. Violence or threats of violence are not permitted.

      Each employee is expected to perform his/her duty to the Company in a safe manner, free of any influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or other
controlled substances. The use of illegal drugs or other controlled substances in the workplace is prohibited.


XIII. VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE
       All employees have a duty to report any known or suspected violation of this Code, including any violation of laws, rules, regulations or policies
that apply to the Company. Reporting a known or suspected violation of this Code by others will not be considered an act of disloyalty, but an action to
safeguard the reputation and integrity of the Company and its employees.

      If an employee knows of or suspects a violation of this Code, it is such employee’s responsibility to immediately report the violation to the
Compliance Officer, who will work with the employee to investigate his/her concern. All questions and reports of known or suspected violations of this
Code will be treated with sensitivity and discretion. The Compliance Officer and the Company will protect the employee’s confidentiality to the extent
possible, consistent with the law and the Company’s need to investigate the employee’s concern.

     It is the Company’s policy that any employee who violates this Code will be subject to appropriate discipline, including termination of
employment, based upon the facts and circumstances of each particular situation. An employee’s conduct, if it does not comply with the law or with this
Code, can result in serious consequences for both the employee and the Company.

      The Company strictly prohibits retaliation against an employee who, in good faith, seeks help or reports known or suspected violations. An
employee inflicting reprisal or retaliation against another employee for reporting a known or suspected violation will be subject to disciplinary action,
including termination of employment.


XIV. WAIVERS OF THE CODE
       Waivers of this Code will be granted on a case-by-case basis and only in extraordinary circumstances. Waivers of this Code may be made only by
the Board, or the appropriate committee of the Board, and may be promptly disclosed to the public if so required by applicable laws and regulations and
rules of the applicable stock exchange.
XV. CONCLUSION
        This Code contains general guidelines for conducting the business of the Company consistent with the highest standards of business ethics. If
employees have any questions about these guidelines, they should contact the Compliance Officer. The Company expects all employees to adhere to
these standards. Each employee is separately responsible for his/her actions. Conduct that violates the law or this Code cannot be justified by claiming
that it was ordered by a supervisor or someone in higher management positions. If an employee engages in conduct prohibited by the law or this Code,
such employee will be deemed to have acted outside the scope of his/her employment. The prohibited conduct will subject the employee to disciplinary
action, including termination of employment.
