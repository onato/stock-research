been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate, or at all. The PRC government imposes control
over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into foreign exchange and through restrictions on
foreign trade.

                                                        FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

      This annual report on Form 20-F contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations and views of future events. These
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the “safe harbor” provisions of
the U.S. Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995.

       You can identify some of these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “is/are likely to,” “potential,” “continue” or other similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements
largely on our current expectations and projections about future events that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business
strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to:
       •     our goals and strategies;
       •     our future business development, financial conditions and results of operations;
       •     the expected growth of the online entertainment industries in mainland China;
       •     our expectations regarding demand for and market acceptance of our products and services;
       •     our expectations regarding our relationships with users, content providers, game developers and publishers, advertisers and other partners;
       •     competition in our industry;
       •     relevant government policies and regulations relating to our industry;
       •     the outcome of any current and future litigation or legal or administrative proceedings; and
       •     other factors described under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors.”

       You should read this annual report and the documents that we refer to in this annual report and have filed as exhibits to this annual report
completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Other sections of this annual
report discuss factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New
risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on
our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

       You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements made in this annual report
relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this annual report. Except as required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date
on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ITEM 3.        KEY INFORMATION
Our Holding Company Structure and Contractual Arrangements with the VIEs
       Bilibili Inc. is not a Chinese operating company but a Cayman Islands holding company with no equity ownership in its VIEs. We conduct our
operations primarily through our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries in mainland China. PRC laws and regulations prohibit foreign
investment in internet cultural business (except for music), the internet audio-visual program business, the radio and television program production and
operation business, and the production of audio-visual products and/or electronic publications. Accordingly, we operate these businesses in mainland
China through the VIEs, and rely on contractual arrangements among our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their shareholders, as applicable, to control the
business operations of the VIEs. Revenues contributed by the VIEs accounted for 74.5%, 73.4% and 69.4% of our total revenues for the years of 2021,
2022 and 2023, respectively. As used in this annual report, “Bilibili” refers to Bilibili Inc., our Cayman Islands holding company; “we,” “us,” “our
company” and “our” refers to Bilibili and its subsidiaries, and, in the context of describing our operations and consolidated financial information, the
VIEs and their subsidiaries in mainland China (which are collectively referred to as the Consolidated Affiliated Entities), including, but not limited to,
Hode Information Technology, which was established in May 2013 to expand our operations; Shanghai Kuanyu, whose control we obtained in July 2014
to further expand our operations; and Chaodian Culture, whose control we obtained in July 2019 to enrich our offerings, and their subsidiaries.

       The following chart illustrates our company’s organizational structure, including our principal subsidiaries and the Consolidated Affiliated Entities
as of the date of this annual report:

                                                                             5
Table of Contents




Notes:
(1) Mr. Rui Chen holds 100% equity interests in Shanghai Kuanyu. He is also the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer.
(2) Shanghai Kuanyu has three subsidiaries.
(3) Mr. Rui Chen, Ms. Ni Li and Mr. Yi Xu hold 52.3%, 3.4% and 44.3% equity interests in Hode Information Technology, respectively, as of the date
     of this annual report. Mr. Chen is our controlling shareholder, the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer. Ms. Li is the
     vice chairwoman of our board of directors and chief operating officer. Mr. Xu is our founder, director and president.
(4) Hode Information Technology has 26 subsidiaries.
(5) Mr. Rui Chen, Ms. Ni Li, Mr. Yi Xu, Mr. Xujun Chai, Shanghai Kuanyu and Hode Information Technology hold 31.2%, 6.8%, 9.5%, 5.1%, 44.6%
     and 2.8% equity interests in Chaodian Culture, respectively, as of the date of this annual report.

       Holders of our Class Z ordinary shares or the ADSs hold equity interest in Bilibili Inc., our Cayman Islands holding company, and do not have
direct or indirect equity interests in the VIEs and their subsidiaries. A series of contractual agreements, including powers of attorney, equity pledge
agreements, letter of undertakings, exclusive business cooperation agreements, and exclusive option agreements, have been entered into by and among
our subsidiaries, the VIEs and their respective shareholders, as applicable. Terms contained in each set of contractual arrangements with the VIEs and
their respective shareholders are substantially similar. As a result of the contractual arrangements, we have effective control over and are considered the
primary beneficiary of these companies, and we have consolidated the financial results of these companies in our consolidated financial statements. For
more details of these contractual arrangements, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure—Agreements that provide us
effective control over the relevant VIEs.”

                                                                             6
Table of Contents

      However, the contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over the VIEs and we may incur
substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements. In addition, these agreements have not been tested in PRC courts. See “Item 3. Key
Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—We rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders
for our operations in mainland China, which may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership” and “Item 3. Key Information
—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—The shareholders of the VIEs may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which
may materially and adversely affect our business.”

       There are also substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules regarding
the status of the rights of Bilibili, a Cayman Islands holding company, with respect to its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their individual
shareholders. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to VIE structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide.
If we or any of the existing or past VIEs is found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of
the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or
failures. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—If the PRC government finds that the agreements
that establish the structure for operating our businesses in mainland China do not comply with PRC regulations on foreign investment in internet and
other related businesses, or if these regulations or their interpretation change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to
relinquish our interests in those operations” and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—Substantial
uncertainties exist with respect to how the Foreign Investment Law may impact the viability of our current corporate structure and operations.”

       Our corporate structure is subject to risks associated with our contractual arrangements with the VIEs. If the PRC government deems that our
contractual arrangements with the VIEs do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these
regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be
forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs, and investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential
future actions by the PRC government that could affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly
affect the financial performance of the VIEs and our company as a whole. For a detailed description of the risks associated with our corporate structure,
please refer to risks disclosed under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure.”

      PRC government’s significant authority in regulating our operations and its oversight and control over offerings conducted overseas by, and
foreign investment in, China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors.
Implementation of industry-wide regulations, including data security or anti-monopoly related regulations, in this nature may cause the value of such
securities to significantly decline or be of little or no value. For more details, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing
Business in China—The PRC government’s significant oversight over our business operation could result in a material adverse change in our operations
and the value of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs.”

      Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in mainland China, including risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and
quickly evolving rules and regulations in mainland China, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities. For
more details, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Uncertainties in the interpretation and
enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us.”


Permissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations
       We conduct our business primarily through our subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries in mainland China. Our operations in mainland China
are governed by PRC laws and regulations. As of the date of this annual report, our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries have obtained the
requisite licenses and permits from the PRC government authorities that are material for the business operations of Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries, the
VIEs and their subsidiaries in mainland China, including, among others, Value-added Telecommunication Business Licenses, a License for Online
Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, Online Culture Operating Permits and Licenses for Production and Operation of Radio and Television
Program. Given the uncertainties of interpretation and implementation of relevant laws and regulations and the enforcement practice by relevant
government authorities, we may be required to obtain additional licenses, permits, filings or approvals for the functions and services of our platform in
the future. For more detailed information, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We face
uncertainties with respect to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and Notice 3” and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—If we fail to obtain and maintain the licenses and approvals required within the complex
regulatory environment applicable to our businesses in mainland China, or if we are required to take compliance actions that are time-consuming or
costly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.”

                                                                               7

        Furthermore, the PRC government has indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or
foreign investment in China-based issuers. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering
and Listing by Domestic Companies and five supporting guidelines, effective March 31, 2023. On May 26, 2023, the CSRC promulgated another
supporting guideline, which came into effect on the same date. According to these measures, mainland China companies that directly or indirectly offer
or list their securities in an overseas market are required to file with the CSRC. An overseas listed company must also submit the filing with respect to
its follow-on offerings, issuance of convertible corporate bonds and exchangeable bonds, and other equivalent offering activities, within a specific time
frame requested under these measures. Therefore, we will be required to file with the CSRC for our overseas offering of equity and equity linked
securities in the future within the applicable scope of these measures. For more detailed information, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—
Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The approval of, or report and filings with the CSRC or other PRC government authorities may be required
in connection with our offshore offerings under PRC law, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain such
approval or complete such filing and report process.”


The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
       Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a
registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, the SEC will prohibit our shares or
ADSs from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On December 16, 2021, the
PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public
accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, and our auditor was subject to that determination.

       In May 2022, the SEC conclusively listed us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of our annual report on
Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that vacated its December 16, 2021
determination and removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely
registered public accounting firms. As of the date of this annual report, the PCAOB has not issued any new determination that it is unable to inspect or
investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in any jurisdiction. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a
Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA after we file this annual report on Form 20-F.

       Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among
other jurisdictions. If the PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in
mainland China and Hong Kong and we continue to use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our
financial statements filed with the SEC, we would be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 20-F
for the relevant fiscal year. In accordance with the HFCAA, our securities would be prohibited from being traded on a national securities exchange or in
the over-the-counter trading market in the United States if we are identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive years in the future.
Although our Class Z ordinary shares have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the ADSs and the Class Z ordinary shares are fully
fungible, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be sustained or that
the ADSs can be converted and traded with sufficient market recognition and liquidity, if our shares and ADSs are prohibited from trading in the United
States. A prohibition of being able to trade in the United States would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our ADSs when you wish to
do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our ADSs. Also, such a prohibition would
significantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, and prospects. See also “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The PCAOB had
historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of the auditor in the
past had deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections” and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing
Business in China—Our ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the
HFCAA, in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of
their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.”

                                                                             8

Cash and Asset Flows Through Our Organization
      Bilibili Inc. transfers cash to its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiaries, by making capital contributions or providing loans, and the Hong Kong
subsidiaries transfer cash to the subsidiaries in mainland China by making capital contributions or providing loans to them. Because Bilibili Inc. and its
subsidiaries control the VIEs through contractual arrangements, they are not able to make direct capital contribution to the VIEs and their subsidiaries.
However, they may transfer cash to the VIEs by loans or by making payments to the VIEs for inter-group transactions.

      For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, Bilibili Inc., through its intermediate holding companies, had provided capital
contribution and loans of RMB7.6 billion, RMB10.8 billion and nil, respectively, to its subsidiaries in mainland China.

       For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the VIEs received debt financings of RMB3.3 billion, RMB1.9 billion, and nil,
respectively, from our offshore subsidiaries and our WFOEs. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the VIEs repaid debt financings
of nil, nil, and RMB0.7 billion (US$98.0 million), respectively, to our offshore subsidiaries and our WFOEs.

      The VIEs may transfer cash to our WFOEs by paying consulting and services charges according to the exclusive business cooperation agreement,
and the VIEs may receive cash from our WFOEs under business agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the VIEs received
cash of RMB1.0 billion, RMB3.3 billion and RMB1.1 billion (US$149.5 million) from WFOEs, respectively, pursuant to these agreements.

       For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, no dividends or distributions were made to Bilibili Inc. by our subsidiaries. Under PRC
laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs are subject to certain restrictions with respect to paying dividends or otherwise transferring any
of their net assets to us. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned enterprise out of mainland China is also subject to examination by the
banks designated by SAFE. The amounts restricted include the paid-up capital and the statutory reserve funds of our PRC subsidiaries and the net assets
of the VIEs in which we have no legal ownership, totaling RMB3.8 billion, RMB7.8 billion and RMB6.5 billion (US$0.9 billion) as of December 31,
2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Furthermore, cash transfers from our PRC subsidiaries to entities outside of mainland China are subject to PRC
government control of currency conversion. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may temporarily delay the ability of our PRC subsidiaries
and the VIEs to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated
obligations. For risks related to the fund flows of our operations in mainland China, see “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Doing Business in China—We may rely on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the
ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and to pay dividends to
our shareholders and ADS holders.”

      In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, no assets other than cash were transferred through our organization.

      Bilibili Inc. has not declared or paid any cash dividends, nor does it have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on its ordinary shares in the
foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. See
“Item 8. Financial Information—A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—Dividend Policy.” For the Cayman Islands, PRC and
U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to an investment in our Class Z ordinary shares or the ADSs, see “Item 10. Additional Information—
E. Taxation.” For purposes of illustration, the following discussion reflects the hypothetical taxes that might be required to be paid within mainland
China and Hong Kong, assuming that: (i) we have taxable earnings, and (ii) we determine to pay a dividend in the future:

Notes:
(1) For purposes of this example, the tax calculation has been simplified. The hypothetical book pre-tax earnings amount, not considering timing
     differences, is assumed to equal Chinese taxable income.
(2) Under the terms of VIE agreements, our PRC subsidiaries may charge the VIEs for services provided to VIEs. These fees shall be recognized as
     expenses of the VIEs, with a corresponding amount as service income by our PRC subsidiaries and eliminate in consolidation. For income tax
     purposes, our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs file income tax returns on a separate company basis. The fees paid are recognized as a tax deduction
     by the VIEs and as income by our PRC subsidiaries and are tax neutral.
(3) Certain of our subsidiaries and the VIEs qualifies for a 15% preferential income tax rate in mainland China. However, such rate is subject to
     qualification, temporary in nature, and may not be available in a future period when distributions are paid. For purposes of this hypothetical
     example, the table above reflects a maximum tax scenario under which the full statutory rate would be effective.
(4) The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a company in mainland China to its
     immediate holding company outside of mainland China. A lower withholding income tax rate of 5% is applied if the immediate holding company
     is registered in Hong Kong or other jurisdictions that have a tax treaty arrangement with mainland China, subject to specific qualification
     requirements at the time of the distribution. For purposes of this hypothetical example, the table above assumes a maximum tax scenario under
     which the full withholding tax would be applied even though we have Hong Kong subsidiaries and would likely make any dividends through
     them.

      The table above has been prepared under the assumption that all profits of the VIEs will be distributed as fees to our PRC subsidiaries under tax
neutral contractual arrangements. If in the future, the accumulated earnings of the VIEs exceed the fees paid to our PRC subsidiaries (or if the current
and contemplated fee structure between the intercompany entities is determined to be non-substantive and disallowed by Chinese tax authorities), the
VIEs could, as a matter of last resort, make a non-deductible transfer to our PRC subsidiaries for the amounts of the stranded cash in the VIEs. This
would result in such transfer being non-deductible expenses for the VIEs but still taxable income for the PRC subsidiaries. Such a transfer and the
related tax burdens would reduce our after-tax income to approximately 50.6% of the pre-tax income. Our management believes that there is only a
remote possibility that this scenario would happen.

Summary Risk Factors
      Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. With respect to the legal risks associated with being based in and
having operations in mainland China as discussed in relevant risk factors under “—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure” and “—Risks Related to
Doing Business in China,” the laws, regulations and the discretion of mainland China governmental authorities discussed in this annual report are
expected to apply to mainland China entities and businesses, rather than entities or businesses in Hong Kong which operate under a different set of laws
from mainland China. These risks are discussed more fully under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors.”


Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
       •     We operate in a fast-evolving industry. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully implement our commercialization strategies or
             develop new ones, or generate sustainable revenues and profit.
       •     We have incurred significant losses and we may continue to experience losses in the future.
       •     If we fail to anticipate user preferences and provide products and services to attract and retain users, or if we fail to keep up with rapid
             changes in technologies and their impact on user behavior, we may not be able to attract sufficient user traffic to remain competitive, and
             our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
       •     Our business depends on our ability to provide users with interesting and useful content, which in turn depends on the content contributed
             by the content creators on our platform.
       •     Our business generates and processes a large amount of data, and we are required to comply with PRC and other applicable laws relating to
             privacy and cybersecurity. The improper use or disclosure of data could have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.
       •     Any compromise of the cybersecurity of our platform could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and reputation.
       •     Increases in the content costs on our platform may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
       •     If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is deemed to violate any
             PRC laws or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
       •     If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is considered
             inappropriate or offensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
       •     We face uncertainties with respect to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and Notice 3.

                                                                            16

Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
       •    Bilibili Inc. is a Cayman Islands holding company conducting our operations primarily through its PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their
            subsidiaries in mainland China; we have no equity ownership in the VIEs and their subsidiaries. Holders of our Class Z ordinary shares or
            the ADSs hold equity interest in Bilibili Inc., our Cayman Islands holding company, and do not have direct or indirect equity interests in
            the VIEs and their subsidiaries. If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our business in
            mainland China do not comply with PRC laws and regulations, or if these regulations or their interpretations change in the future, we could
            be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs, and
            investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC government that could affect the enforceability of the
            contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance of the VIEs and our company as a
            whole.


Risks Related to Doing Business in China
       •    The PRC government’s significant authority in regulating our operations and its oversight and control over offerings conducted overseas
            by, and foreign investment in, China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer
            securities to investors. Implementation of industry-wide regulations in this nature may cause the value of such securities to significantly
            decline. Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you
            and us. See “—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—The PRC government’s significant oversight over our business operation could
            result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs.”
       •    We face uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform
            Economy Sector and other anti-monopoly and competition laws and how it may impact our business operations. See “—Risks Related to
            Doing Business in China—We face uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines
            for the Internet Platform Economy Sector and other anti-monopoly and competition laws and how it may impact our business operations.”
       •    The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct
            inspections of the auditor in the past had deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections. See “—Risks Related to Doing
            Business in China—The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work and the inability of the
            PCAOB to conduct inspections of the auditor in the past had deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections.”

Risks Related to Our Listed Securities
       •     The trading price of our listed securities have been and are likely to continue to be volatile, regardless of our operating performance, which
             could result in substantial losses to our investors.


Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We operate in a fast-evolving industry. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully implement our commercialization strategies or develop new
ones, or generate sustainable revenues and profit.
       We operate in a fast-evolving industry, and our commercialization model is evolving. We generate revenues primarily by providing our users with
valuable content, such as videos, mobile games and live broadcasting. We also generate revenues from advertising, IP derivatives and other services. We
cannot assure you that we can successfully implement the existing commercialization strategies to sustainably generate growing revenues, or that we
will be able to develop new commercialization strategies to grow our revenues. If our strategic initiatives do not enhance our ability to commercialize or
enable us to develop new commercialization approaches, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues or recover any associated costs. In
addition, we may introduce new products and services to expand our revenue streams, including products and services with which we have little or no
prior development or operating experience. If these new or enhanced products or services fail to engage users, content creators or business partners, we
may fail to diversify our revenue streams or generate sufficient revenues to justify our investments and costs, and our business and operating results may
suffer as a result.


We have incurred significant losses and we may continue to experience losses in the future.
      We have incurred significant losses in the past. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, we had loss from operations of RMB6,429.1 million,
RMB8,357.9 million and RMB5,064.2 million (US$713.3 million), respectively. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate profits in the
future. Our ability to achieve profitability depends in large part on our ability to manage our costs and expenses, many of which are beyond our control.
We are disciplined about our costs and operating expenses and we will continue to undertake cost control measures, but there can be no assurance that
we will realize cost savings of these actions. We may experience losses in the future due to our continued investments in technology, talent, content,
brand recognition, expanding user base, improving user experience and other initiatives. In addition, our ability to achieve and sustain profitability is
affected by various factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in macroeconomic and regulatory environment or competitive
dynamics in the industry. Accordingly, you should not rely on our financial results of any prior period as an indication of our future performance.


If we fail to anticipate user preferences and provide products and services to attract and retain users, or if we fail to keep up with rapid changes in
technologies and their impact on user behavior, we may not be able to attract sufficient user traffic to remain competitive, and our business and
prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
      Our ability to retain, grow and engage our user base depends heavily on our ability to provide a superior user experience. We must offer quality
content covering a wide range of interests and formats, introduce successful new products and services, develop user-friendly platform features, and
push effective content feeds recommendations. In particular, we must encourage content creators to upload more appealing professional user generated
content and we must source more popular licensed content. We must also keep providing our users with features and functions that could enable superior
content viewing and social interaction experience. If we are unable to provide a superior user experience, our user base and user engagement may
decline, which may materially and adversely affect our business and growth prospects.

                                                                            18
Table of Contents

      We maintain a large content library primarily consisting of professional user generated video, or PUGV, and occupationally generated video, or
OGV. We are constantly developing new features to attract and retain our users. In order to expand our content library, we must continue to work with
our content creators and incentivize them to produce content that reflects cultural trends and maintain good business relationships with licensors of
premium copyrighted content to renew our licenses and source new professionally produced content. Our content creators and licensors may choose to
work with other large online video platforms to distribute their content if such platforms can offer better products, services or terms than we do. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to attract our content creators to upload their content to our platform or renew or enter into license agreements on
commercially reasonable terms with our licensors or at all.

      In addition, the industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and changing user expectations. To remain
competitive, we must adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and improve the performance and reliability of our products and
services to be able to adapt to these changes and innovate in response to evolving user expectations. Developing and integrating new content, products,
services and technologies into our existing platform could be expensive and time-consuming, and these efforts may not yield the benefits we expect. If
we fail to develop new products, services or innovative technologies on a timely basis, or our new products, services or technologies are not accepted by
our users, our business, financial performance and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we can anticipate
user preferences and industry changes and respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner.

       In addition, changes in user behavior resulting from technological developments may also adversely affect us. For example, the widespread
adoption of artificial intelligence could significantly change the way people look for content or the type of content they consume. Responding to this
change could require substantial expenditures to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into our products, services or infrastructure. In particular,
tools for artificial intelligence generated content may enhance both content creation efficiency and user experience, and search functions powered by
artificial intelligence may enhance user experience by offering more personalized and captivating content. However, we cannot assure you that we will
be able to capture these potential benefits of artificial intelligence in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our competitors may develop artificial
intelligence products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also
integrate artificial intelligence into their offerings more efficiently. If we fail to keep up with rapid technological changes to remain competitive, our
future success may be adversely affected.


Our business depends on our ability to provide users with interesting and useful content, which in turn depends on the content contributed by the
content creators on our platform.
       The quality of the content offered on our platform and our users’ level of engagement are critical to our success. In order to attract and retain users
and compete effectively, we must offer interesting and useful content and enhance our users’ viewing experience. It is vital to our operations that we
remain sensitive to and responsive to evolving user preferences and offer content that appeals to our users. In 2023, 95.2% of the total video views are of
PUGV, as compared to 94.6% in 2022. Thus far, we have been generally able to encourage our content creators to create and upload PUGV that are
appealing to our users. We have also been providing our content creators with support and guidance in various forms, including tools and products to
help realize their commercial values and technical support for content distribution, editing and uploading. However, we cannot assure you that our
content creators can contribute to create popular PUGV for our platform. If our content creators cease to contribute content, or their uploaded content
fails to attract or retain our users, we may experience a decline in user traffic and user engagement. If the number of users or the level of user
engagement declines, we may suffer a reduction in revenue.


Our business generates and processes a large amount of data, and we are required to comply with PRC and other applicable laws relating to privacy
and cybersecurity. The improper use or disclosure of data could have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.
      Our business generates and processes a large quantity of data. We face risks inherent in handling and protecting large volume of data. In particular,
we face a number of challenges relating to data from transactions and other activities on our platforms, including:
       •      protecting the data in and hosted on our system, including against attacks on our system by outside parties or fraudulent behavior or
              improper use by our employees;
       •      addressing concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security and other factors; and
       •      complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure and security of personal
              information, including any requests from regulatory and government authorities relating to these data.

                                                                              19
Table of Contents

       In general, we expect that data security and data protection compliance will receive greater attention and focus from regulators, both domestically
and globally, as well as attract continued or greater public scrutiny and attention going forward, which could increase our compliance costs and subject
us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If we are unable to manage these risks, we could become subject to
penalties, including fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, and our reputation and results of operations could be materially
and adversely affected.

      The PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to data security and data protection is evolving and may be subject to different
interpretations or significant changes. Moreover, different PRC regulatory bodies, including the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress,
the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State
Administration for Market Regulation, or the SAMR, have enforced data privacy and protections laws and regulations with varying standards and
applications. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Internet Information Security
and Privacy Protection.” The following are examples of certain recent PRC regulatory activities in this area:


Data Security
       •     In December 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, together with other authorities, jointly promulgated the Cybersecurity Review
             Measures, which became effective on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, critical information
             infrastructure operators that procure internet products and services and the network platform operators that conduct data processing
             activities must be subject to the cybersecurity review if their activities affect or may affect national security. Under these measures,
             network platform operators that hold personal information of over one million users shall apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a
             cybersecurity review before any public listing in a foreign country. As of the date of this annual report, no detailed rules or implementation
             rules have been issued by any authority and we have not been informed that we are a critical information infrastructure operator by any
             government authorities. Furthermore, the exact scope of “critical information infrastructure operators” under the current regulatory regime
             remains unclear, and the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of the applicable
             laws. Therefore, it is uncertain whether we would be deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator under PRC law. If we are
             deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we may be subject to
             obligations in addition to what we have fulfilled under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations.
       •     In November 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations of Internet Data Security Management (Draft for
             Comments). These draft regulations provide that data processors refer to individuals or organizations that, during their data processing
             activities such as data collection, storage, utilization, processing, transmission, provision, publication and deletion, have autonomy over the
             purpose and the manner of data processing. Under these draft regulations, data processors shall apply for a cybersecurity review for certain
             activities, including, among other things, (i) the listing in a foreign country of data processors that process the personal information of
             more than one million users and (ii) any data processing activity that affects or may affect national security. However, there have been no
             clarifications from the relevant authorities as of the date of this annual report as to the standards for determining whether an activity is one
             that “affects or may affect national security.” In addition, these draft regulations require that data processors that process “important data”
             or are listed overseas must conduct an annual data security assessment by itself or commission a data security service provider to do so,
             and submit the assessment report of the preceding year to the municipal cybersecurity department by the end of January each year. As of
             the date of this annual report, the Regulations of Internet Data Security Management (Draft for Comments) has not been adopted, and the
             provisions thereunder, the adoption and the effective date may be subject to change with substantial uncertainty.
       •     In March 2024, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Provisions on Promoting and Regulating Cross-border Data Flows,
             which required security assessment for the following types of cross-border data transfers, (i) for critical information infrastructure
             operators, the outbound transfer of personal information or important data, and (ii) for data processors that are not critical information
             infrastructure operators, the outbound transfer of important data or the cumulative outbound transfer within one calendar year of the
             personal information of over one million people or the sensitive personal information of over 10,000 people. These provisions also
             stipulated that, when data processors that are not critical information infrastructure operators engage in the cumulative outbound transfer
             within one calendar year of the personal information of over 10,000 people but less than one million people or the sensitive personal
             information of less than 10,000 people, the data processors must enter into a standard contract for cross-border transfer of personal
             information with the data recipient or obtain a certification for the protection of personal information. Furthermore, these provisions
             clarified that data processors do not need to treat any data as “important data” the outbound transfer of which requires security
             assessments, if government authorities have not declared or notified them that the data are “important data.


Personal Information and Privacy
       •     In August 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law, which
             integrates the scattered rules with respect to personal information rights and privacy protection and took effect on November 1, 2021. We
             update our privacy policies from time to time to meet the latest regulatory requirements of PRC government authorities and adopt technical
             measures to protect data and ensure cybersecurity in a systematic way. Nonetheless, the Personal Information Protection Law elevates the
             protection requirements for personal information processing, and many specific requirements of this law remain to be clarified by the
             regulatory authorities, and courts in practice. We may be required to make further adjustments to our business practices to comply with the
             personal information protection laws and regulations.

                                                                            20
Table of Contents

       •     In June 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Provisions on the Administration of Internet Users’ Account Information,
             which became effective on August 1, 2022 and stipulated that internet information service providers must, among other things, equip
             themselves with professional and technical capabilities appropriate to the scale of their services, and establish, improve and strictly
             implement systems for identity authentication, account verification, information safekeeping, ecological governance, emergency response,
             personal information protection, among others. The provisions also require that the internet information service providers should handle
             and protect internet users’ account information in accordance with law, and take measures to prevent unauthorized access, as well as
             leakage, tampering, or loss of personal information. The internet information service providers must set up convenient portals for
             complaints and whistleblowing at an easily seen location, provide channels for complaints and whistleblowing, improve the acceptance,
             screening, disposal and feedback mechanisms, specify the handling process and feedback time limit and timely handle the complaints and
             whistleblowing of users and the public.

       Many of the data-related legislations are relatively new and certain concepts thereunder remain subject to interpretation by the regulators. If any
data that we possess belongs to data categories that are subject to heightened scrutiny, we may be required to adopt stricter measures for protection and
management of such data. The Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Regulations of Internet Data Security Management (Draft for Comments)
remain unclear on whether the relevant requirements will be applicable to companies that are already listed in the United States, such as us. We cannot
predict the impact of the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Regulations of Internet Data Security Management (Draft for Comments), if any, at
this stage, and we will closely monitor and assess any development in the rule-making process. If the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the enacted
version of the Regulations of Internet Data Security Management (Draft for Comments) mandate clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific
actions to be taken by issuers like us, we face uncertainties as to whether we can complete these additional procedures timely, or at all, which may
subject us to government enforcement actions and investigations, fines, penalties, suspension of our non-compliant operations, or removal of our app
from the relevant application stores, and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. As of the date of this annual report, we
have not been involved in any formal investigations on cybersecurity review made by the Cyberspace Administration of China on such basis.

      In general, compliance with the existing PRC laws and regulations, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may
enact in the future, related to data security and personal information protection, may be costly and result in additional expenses to us, and subject us to
negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and business operations. There are also uncertainties with respect to how such laws and regulations
will be implemented and interpreted in practice.

       In addition, regulatory authorities around the world have adopted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning
data protection. These legislative and regulatory proposals, if adopted, and the uncertain interpretations and application thereof could, in addition to the
possibility of fines, result in an order requiring that we change our data practices and policies, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, includes operational
requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Economic Area. These regulations establish new
requirements applicable to the processing of personal data, affords new data protection rights to individuals and imposes penalties for serious data
breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under these regulations for financial or non-financial losses. Although we do not conduct any
business in the European economic area, in the event that residents of the European economic area access our website or our mobile platform and input
protected information, we may become subject to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation.

                                                                             21
Table of Contents

Any compromise of the cybersecurity of our platform could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and reputation.
       Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and other customers’ information, and security breaches expose us to a
risk of loss of this information, litigation and potential liability. We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees from time to time, and we have been
able to rectify attacks without significant impact to our operations in the past. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error,
malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users or other customers to disclose sensitive
information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or other customers’ data or accounts, or may otherwise obtain access to such data or
accounts. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not
recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual
or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose users and
other customers, and may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims and regulatory fines and penalties. Any of these
actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.


Increases in the content costs on our platform may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
      We need to acquire or produce popular content to provide our users with an engaging and satisfying viewing experience. The acquisition of such
content depends on our ability to retain our content creators, OGV partners and hosts of our live broadcasting programs. We recorded content costs in
our cost of revenue of RMB2,694.8 million, RMB3,496.9 million and RMB3,195.6 million (US$450.1 million) in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.
We have undertaken measures to prudently manage our content costs by focusing on the acquisition of high-quality content. However, acquisition of
high-quality content can be costly. The market prices for licensing fees and royalties for licensed content have increased significantly in mainland China
during the past few years. Online video broadcasting programs are competing aggressively to license popular content titles and events, driving licensing
fees up in general. As the market further grows, copyright owners, distributors and industry participants may demand higher licensing fees for such
content. Although we have undertaken measures to prudently manage our content costs by focusing on the acquisition of high-quality content, as our
content library expands and the prices of licensing premium content increase due to various reasons beyond our control, we still expect the costs of
licensed content to continue to increase. Therefore, we may not be able to effectively manage our content costs. If we are unable to generate sufficient
revenues to outpace the increase in costs content, or effectively control our content costs, we may incur more losses and our business, financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected.


If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is deemed to violate any PRC
laws or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
      The PRC government and regulatory authorities have adopted regulations governing content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games,
audios and other information over the internet. Under these regulations, internet content providers are prohibited from posting or displaying content that,
among other things, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China or the public interest, or is obscene, superstitious,
fraudulent, violent or defamatory on the internet. Internet content providers are also prohibited from displaying content that may be deemed by relevant
government authorities as “socially destabilizing” or leaking “state secrets” of China. The PRC government and regulatory authorities strengthen the
regulations on internet content from time to time, such as the Opinion on Strictly Regulating Online Game Market Management jointly adopted by a few
authorities in December 2017, the Regulations on Administration of Network Short Video Platforms, promulgated in January 2019 by China Netcasting
Services Association, the Censoring Criteria for Network Short Video Content promulgated in January 2019 and last amended in December 2021, the
Administrative Provisions on Online Audio-Visual Information Services, effective from January 1, 2020 and the Notice on Strengthening the
Administration of Live Broadcasting of Game-Playing on the Online Audio-Visual Program Platform, issued in April 2022 by the Online Audio-Visual
Program Administration Division of the National Radio and Television Administration of the PRC (the successor of the State Administration of Press,
Publication, Radio, Film and Television) and the Publishing Bureau of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China. The enactment of these regulations may significantly increase our compliance costs in recruiting additional content reviewers and training them
to identify the prohibited content timely and accurately. Any failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to liability. In November 2020, the
National Radio and Television Administration further promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Management of Online Show Live Broadcasting and
E-commerce Live Broadcasting, or Notice 78, which requests the live broadcasting platforms for online shows to strengthen positive value guidance and
to prevent the spread of the trends of wealth flaunting, money worshiping and vulgarity. In February 2021, the Notice on Promulgation of the Guiding
Opinions on Strengthening the Standardized Administration of Online Live Broadcasting, or Notice 3, was issued by the Cyberspace Administration of
China and other governmental authorities, which further requires live broadcasting platforms to ensure correct orientation and content safety. On
September 15, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China promulgated the Opinions on Further Compacting the Main Responsibility of the Website
Platform on Information Content Management, which regulates the content and quality of the information and further requires the website platform to
improve the content review mechanism. On October 26, 2021, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission issued the Notice on Further
Strengthening the Regulation on Online Information of Entertainment Celebrities. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B.
Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—
B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”

                                                                            22
Table of Contents

      In addition to licensed content provided by copyright owners, we allow our users to upload content to our platform. Our users can upload all types
of content including professionally produced content and certain graphical files for the purpose of updating user biographies and content covers.
Currently, only registered users are allowed to upload content to our platform. We maintain two levels of content management and review procedures to
monitor the content uploaded to our platform to ensure that no content that may be deemed to be prohibited by government rules and regulations is
posted and to promptly remove any infringing content. Our content screening team screens and monitors the content uploaded on our platform on a
24-hour, seven-day basis. For more details relating to our content monitoring procedures, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business
Overview—Content Management and Review.” However, there can be no assurance that we can identify all the videos or other content that may violate
relevant laws and regulations due to the large amount of content uploaded by our users every day.


If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our platform is considered inappropriate or
offensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
      Failure to identify and prevent illegal or inappropriate content from being uploaded and/or streamed on our platform may subject us to liability. To
the extent that PRC regulatory authorities find any content on our platform objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of
such content on our platform in the form of take-down orders, cause our app to be temporarily removed from app stores, or temporarily disable certain
functions on our platform, or otherwise. If we fail to immediately stop the transmission of inappropriate content, take measures such as removing the
content to prevent dissemination, keep relevant records, and report to the competent authority, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties, including
warning and suspension or termination of services or products. Our app was temporarily removed from app stores in the past. Although we implemented
the required measures promptly and reinstated the mobile app downloads from those app stores, conducted a self-inspection by taking a comprehensive
review of the content on our platform thereafter and hired more content monitoring personnel, there can be no assurance that our app will not be
removed from app stores again in the future, and such removal could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Local government
authorities made inquiries with us in response to allegedly inappropriate content on our platform in the past and we completed the required rectification.

      PRC laws and regulations are subject to interpretation by the relevant authorities, and it may not be possible to determine in all cases the types of
content that could result in our liability as a platform operator. We may also face liability for copyright or trademark infringement, fraud and other
claims based on the nature and content of the materials that are delivered, shared or otherwise accessed through or displayed on our platform.

      Reports or publicity of violence and crimes related to the content on our platform, including, but not limited to, our PUGV, OGV, online games
and live broadcasting programs, or any claims that content on our platform is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent, defamatory, inappropriate, offensive or
impairing the public interest, may result in negative publicity and harm to our brand. Any claim that we have failed to identify any content a viewer may
find objectionable may result in negative publicity, harm to our brand or regulatory actions, which in turn might have a material and adverse impact on
our business and results of operations. These reports, claims or allegations, even if unproven or meritless, may lead to inquiries, investigations, other
forms of regulatory response, or even legal actions against us by regulatory or government authorities as well as private parties.

                                                                             23

      Any regulatory actions against us, perceptions of inappropriate business conduct by us or perceived wrongdoing by any member of our
management team, among other things, could substantially damage our reputation, and cause us to incur significant costs to defend ourselves.
Government authorities may require us to discontinue or restrict the relevant services, functions or products. As a result, our business could suffer and
our user base and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, our advertising revenues might be materially and
adversely affected by any decision by advertisers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports, user complaints or other negative
publicity involving us or, content on our platform. Reductions of advertising by advertisers due to allegedly objectionable content made available on our
platform by content creators, licensors, or other third parties, concerns about our content management practices, concerns about brand reputation or
potential liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations, may also materially and adversely affect our advertising
revenues.


We face uncertainties with respect to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and Notice 3.
       According to Notice 78, platforms providing online show live broadcasting or e-commerce live broadcasting services shall, among other things,
register their information and business operations by November 30, 2020, ensure real-name registration for all live broadcasting hosts and virtual gifting
users, prohibit users that are minors or without real-name registration from virtual gifting, and set a limit on the maximum amount of virtual gifting per
time, per day, and per month.

      As advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, there is currently no explicit provisions as to what limits on virtual gifting will be
imposed by the National Radio and Television Administration pursuant to Notice 78 and it is unclear how and to what degree any such limits would be
imposed on different platforms. Currently, users who can be identified as minors are not allowed to make virtual gifts. However, given there is no
explicit provisions on how to set the limit on virtual gifting, we have not been able to set such limit on our platform. We recorded revenues generated
from our live broadcasting business under VAS. We derived 35.8%, 39.8% and 44.0% of our revenues from VAS in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Any such limits ultimately imposed may negatively impact our revenues derived from virtual gifting and our results of operations.

      Notice 78 also requests the live broadcasting platforms for online shows to register in the National Internet Audio-Visual Platforms Information
Management System, however, in our communication with Shanghai Municipal Administration of Radio and Television, we were informed that
currently we are not required to register in this system. We cannot guarantee that we will not be required to register in the National Internet Audio-
Visual Platform Information Management System in the future, and if so required, whether we will be able to complete the registration in a timely
manner, or at all. Notice 78 also sets forth requirements for certain live broadcasting businesses with respect to real-name registration, limits on user
spending on virtual gifting, restrictions on minors on virtual gifting, live broadcasting review personnel requirements, content tagging requirements, and
other requirements. For more information on Notice 78, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations
Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”

      In February 2021, Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other governmental authorities issued Notice 3, according to which, online live
broadcasting platforms providing online live broadcasting information services shall strictly abide by laws, regulations and regulatory requirements of
the PRC, and shall strictly perform their statutory duties and obligations, implement the list of primary responsibilities of online live broadcasting
platforms and ensure correct orientation and content safety. Meanwhile, Notice 3 sets forth requirements for certain live broadcasting businesses with
respect to real-name registration, restrictions on minors on virtual gifting and other requirements, and further strengthens the industry admittance filing
management. For example, a live broadcasting platform that carries out business-oriented network performance activities must hold an internet cultural
business license and complete ICP filing; and a live broadcasting platform that carries out online audio-visual program services must hold a License for
Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs or complete registration with the National Internet Audio-Visual Platforms Information Management
System, and complete ICP filing.

      Since some of the requirements in Notice 78 and Notice 3 are unclear and have no explicit provisions or implementation standards, we are still in
the process of getting further guidance from regulatory authorities and evaluating the applicability and effect of the various requirements under these
notices on our business. Any further rulemaking under these notices or other intensified regulation with respect to live broadcasting may increase our
compliance burden in the live broadcasting business, and may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

                                                                            24

We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business, which could negatively impact our brand and
financial performance.
       Our financial performance has been and will continue to be influenced by our ability to add, retain and engage active users of our products. Our
user acquisition and engagement may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control. Starting from 2022, we have shifted our user growth focus
from MAU growth to DAU growth, as we believe DAU is not only a better measure of the quality and sustainability of our community, but also better
reflects the powerful influence of our platform and is directly linked to our commercial prospects. We anticipate that our user growth rate will slow over
time as the size of our user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration in China’s internet population. To the extent our user growth rate
slows or the number of our users declines, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to retain existing users and enhance user
activities and stickiness on the platform. If people do not perceive content and other products and services on our platform to be interesting and useful,
we may not be able to retain and attract users or increase their engagement.

       As we grow our user base and increase the level of user engagement, we may incur increasing costs, such as licensing fees and royalties for
licensed content and hosts’ compensation to further expand our content library to meet the growing and diversified demands of our users. If such
expansion is not properly managed, it may adversely affect our financial and operating resources without achieving the desired effects. If we are unable
to generate sufficient revenues to outpace the increase in costs, we may incur more losses and our business, financial condition and results of operations
may be adversely affected. See “—Increases in the content costs on our platform may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.”

       We also anticipate further expansion in global markets. Such expansion will increase the complexity of our operations and might place a
significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We are also exposed to the political, social or economic instability in overseas
markets or regions in which we operate, and such tensions may impact our successful expansion into the overseas market. See also “—We face various
challenges and risks in connection with our expansion into overseas markets.”

       As we only have a limited history of operating our business at its current scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects,
including our ability to grow in the future. In addition, despite our implementation of cost control measures, our costs and expenses may still increase as
we expand our business and continue to invest in our infrastructure to enhance the performance and reliability of our platform. For example, we may
increase our investment in servers and bandwidth to maintain our quality user experience while sustaining the growth of user base. Continued growth
could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our users, content creators and business partners, develop and improve our operational,
financial, legal and management controls, and enhance our reporting systems and procedures. Our costs and expenses may grow faster than our revenues
and may be greater than what we anticipate. If we are unable to generate adequate revenues and to manage our costs and expenses, we may continue to
incur losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability. Managing our growth will require significant
expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows,
our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.


We have a unique community culture that is vital to our success. Our operations may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to maintain our
culture and brand image within our addressable user communities.
       Our users have developed a unique community culture that distinguishes us from other online content providers. Our users come to our platform
for creative content covering a wide array of cultures and interests as well as for strong, vibrant and safe communities. We believe that maintaining and
promoting such community culture is critical to retaining and expanding our user base. We have taken multiple initiatives to preserve our community
culture and values, such as requiring users to pass a membership exam before they are allowed to send bullet chats and utilize other interactive functions
on our platform, and temporarily blocking or permanently deleting accounts of users who posted inappropriate content or comments.

                                                                              25
Table of Contents

       Despite our efforts, we may be unable to maintain and foster our unique community culture and cease to be the preferred platform for our target
users and content creators. As our user base is expanding, we may have difficulties in guiding our new users to honor and abide by our community
values despite the initiatives we have adopted and may adopt in the future. In such event, our user engagement and loyalty may suffer, which would in
turn negatively affect user traffic and our attractiveness to other customers and partners. In addition, frictions among our users and inflammatory
comments posted by internet trolls may damage our community culture and brand image, which would be detrimental to our operations. Historically,
some incidents of intense frictions among our users who belonged to different micro-interests and fans groups disrupted our operations. Users who have
met through our services may become involved in emotionally charged situations and could suffer adverse moral, emotional or physical consequences.
Such events could be highly publicized and have a significant negative impact on our reputation. Government authorities may require us to discontinue
or restrict the relevant services. As a result, our business could suffer and our user base and results of operations may be materially and adversely
affected.


If we fail to obtain and maintain the licenses and approvals required within the complex regulatory environment applicable to our businesses in
mainland China, or if we are required to take compliance actions that are time-consuming or costly, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected.
      The internet and mobile industries in mainland China are highly regulated. The Consolidated Affiliated Entities are required to obtain and
maintain applicable licenses and approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to provide their current services. However, we cannot assure
you that we can successfully renew these licenses in a timely manner or that these licenses are sufficient to conduct all of our present or future business.
As we develop and expand our business scope, we may need to obtain additional qualifications, permits, approvals or licenses. We may be required to
obtain additional licenses or approvals if the PRC government adopts more stringent policies or regulations for our business.

       We are subject to various regulatory requirements in relation to our operation of online games. Since May 2019, the Ministry of Culture and
Tourism ceased to assume the responsibility to administer the online game industry and stopped approving or issuing the Online Culture Operating
Permits regarding online games. Since all of the Online Culture Operating Permits held by the Consolidated Affiliated Entities were granted by local
branches of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism after May 2019, these permits do not cover online game operations. Based on the consultation of
Jingtian & Gongcheng, our PRC counsel, with the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism in January 2024, the Ministry of Culture
and Tourism no longer assumes the responsibility to supervise the operation of online games, and it is not necessary for an enterprise to obtain Online
Culture Operating Permits to operate online game operation business. On December 22, 2023, the National Press and Publication Administration
promulgated the Administrative Measures for Internet Games (Draft for Comment), which provide that the national publishing regulatory authority will
oversee online game publishing activities nationwide while local authorities at county level and above will be responsible for supervision within their
respective administrative regions. As of the date of this annual report, the draft has not been formally adopted. Therefore, our PRC counsel, Jingtian &
Gongcheng, has advised us that we are able to continue our online game operation business although the Online Culture Operating Permits currently
held no longer contain content related to online games operation, which will not constitute any material non-compliance.

        The National Press and Publication Administration at the national level had suspended the approval of game registration and issuance of
publication numbers for online games starting from March 2018, and later resumed game registration and issued game publication numbers for the first
batch of games with an effective date of December 19, 2018. From August 2021, no new game registration and the publication numbers for online
games were approved or issued from the National Press and Publication Administration at the national level until resumed in April 2022, and the
processing time of games registration and issuance of publication numbers may vary greatly and is within the discretion of the National Press and
Publication Administration. Any delay in game registration with National Press and Publication Administration or obtaining game publication numbers
could lead to the termination of our cooperation agreements with third parties or negatively affect the operation results of our games. For more
information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Games.” We cannot
assure you that the suspension of the approval procedure of game registration and issuance of publication numbers would not occur again in the future
and cannot predict how long such duration of suspension will be, and we cannot assure you that we or relevant third parties can obtain the National
Press and Publication Administration’s approvals or complete any new governmental requirements for all games on our platform in a timely manner or
at all, which could adversely and materially impact our ability to introduce new games, the timetable to launch new games and our business growth.

                                                                             26

      If the content of the online games that we are developing or operating is deemed or claimed to be inappropriate, we may fail to obtain the
governmental approval to introduce, launch or operate these games. Even if we have completed new game registrations and obtained publication
numbers for the online games that we introduced, launched or operated, the governmental entities may revoke these for various reasons, such as the
inclusion of content that is deemed or claimed to be inappropriate, and the operations of the online games may be ordered to be suspended or terminated.
Any of these events could cause delays in the launch of new games, cancellation of the development of pipeline games, suspension or termination of the
operation of our existing online games and removal of our online games from app stores, which may materially and adversely affect our business
operations and financial results. Also see “—If the content contained within videos, live broadcasting, games, audios and other content formats on our
platform is considered inappropriate or offensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.”

       Moreover, the provision of online games is deemed to be an internet publication activity. An online game operator may be required to obtain an
Internet Publishing Service License in order to directly make those games publicly available in mainland China. An online game operator is generally
able to publish its games through authorizing third-party licensed electronic publishing entities and applying to the National Press and Publication
Administration for approval of the games as electronic publications, which is consistent with our practice as of the date of this annual report. However,
the Administrative Measures for Internet Games (Draft for Comment), which has not been formally adopted as of the date of this annual report,
stipulates that any online game operator must obtain an Internet Publishing Service License that covers online game operation. If this draft regulation is
adopted and becomes effective in its current form, we will be required to obtain an Internet Publishing Service License, and we cannot assure you that
we can obtain this license in a timely manner or at all, and our failure to do so may subject us to administrative penalties.

       In addition, the provision of comics online may be deemed to be an internet publication activity, which may require the content provider to obtain
an Internet Publishing Service License. Furthermore, in a consultation with the competent government authorities in January 2024, our PRC counsel,
Jingtian & Gongcheng, was informed that operation of an online comics business currently does not require the Internet Publishing Service License. If
the regulatory policies change in the future and we fail to complete, obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals or make the necessary
filings, we may be subject to various penalties, such as confiscation of the net revenues that were generated through online games and comics, the
imposition of fines, the revocation of our business and operating licenses and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations of online games and
comics.

       Under the Administrative Regulations on the Introduction and Broadcasting of Foreign Television Programs, the introduction or broadcasting of
foreign anime in mainland China is subject to approval of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television or its authorized
entities. Approval or filing procedures were previously not explicitly required in practice by the National Radio and Television Administration for the
broadcasting and distribution of foreign anime on the internet only, until the National Radio and Television Administration and its authorized authorities
clarified and implemented the relevant filing procedure in 2021. Since then, based on our consultation with the relevant government authorities, we have
been following the required filing procedure for our newly introduced foreign anime before broadcasting and distributing them on our platform.
According to the Regulations on the Administration of Algorithm Recommendation for Internet Information Services, which came into effect in March
2022, providers of algorithm recommendation services with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities should fill in information such
as the name of the service provider, service form, application area, type of algorithm, algorithm self-assessment report, intended public content and other
information through the Internet Information Services Algorithm Filing System within ten working days from the date of service provision to fulfill the
filing procedures. As of the date of this annual report, we have completed the filings for some of our algorithms through the Internet Information
Services Algorithm Filing System and submitted the filings for the other algorithms, which are currently under the review of the competent regulatory
authority.

                                                                            27

       In November 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Circular on Effectively Strengthening the Governance of Online Violence,
requiring website platforms to establish the classification standards for online violence information and the sample database of model cases, establish
the identification model for online violence in light of their own characteristics, establish the emergency response mechanism for online violence,
provide the settings for closing the private messages, comments, forwarding and “@” message of strangers with one click and optimize the rules for
private messages. On December 15, 2022, the Administrative Provisions on Online Comment Following Services became effective, according to which,
the providers of online comment following services shall verify the identity information of registered users, and shall not provide online comment
following services to users who have not verified their identity information or falsely use the identity information of any organization or other
individuals. For internet follow-up comment services for news information, the system of “content check before publication” shall be established; and
for internet follow-up comment services by way of bullet chats, the corresponding static version of information content shall be provided on the same
platform and page at the same time.

       Considerable uncertainties exist in relation to the interpretation and implementation of existing and future laws and regulations governing our
business activities. We could be found in violation of any future laws and regulations or of the laws and regulations currently in effect due to changes in
the relevant authorities’ interpretation of these laws and regulations. If we fail to complete, obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals
or make the necessary filings, we may be subject to various penalties, such as confiscation of the net revenues that were generated through the
unlicensed internet or mobile activities, the imposition of fines and the discontinuation or restriction of our operations. Any such penalties or changes in
policies, regulations or enforcement by government authorities, may disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.


The PRC government has taken steps to limit online game playing time for all minors and to otherwise control the content and operation of online
games. Such restrictions on online games may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.
      As part of its anti-addiction online game policy, the PRC regulators have been implementing regulations designed to reduce the amount of time
that youth under the age of 18 spend playing online games. For a detailed description of these regulations, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—
B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Games—Anti-addiction System and Protection of Minors.” On October 25, 2019,
the National Press and Publication Administration issued the Notice on Preventing Minors from Indulging in Online Games, which requires all online
gamers to register accounts with their valid identity information and all game companies to stop providing game services to users who fail to do so. On
August 30, 2021, the National Press and Publication Administration promulgated the Notice on Further Strict Management to Effectively Prevent
Minors from Being Addicted to Online Games, which became effective on September 1, 2021. This notice requires that all online games enterprises
including platforms providing online game services may only provide online game services to minors for one hour from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. each day
on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays, and may not provide online game services to minors in any form at any other time. All online
games must be connected to the real-name verification system of the National Press and Publication Administration for online games to prevent
addiction, all online game users must use real and valid identity information to register their game accounts and log in to online games, and online
games enterprises must not provide online game services in any form (including visitor experience mode) to users who have not registered and logged in
with their real names.

       Furthermore, minors are prohibited from playing games exceeding a certain period of time per day or putting money into their accounts exceeding
a certain amount. Online game operators are required to explore the manner to notify users of different ages about the online games based on various
criteria, such as the games’ content and the amount of money anticipated to be used in the games, on the games’ download, registration and log-in pages
in a prominent way. The Administrative Measures for Internet Games (Draft for Comment) promulgated by the National Press and Publication
Administration in December 2023 provided that there should be strict control over the duration and time minors spend playing online games and minors
should be prohibited from accessing games that may easily lead to addiction or contain inappropriate content for minors. As of the date of this annual
report, the draft has not been formally adopted. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation
—Regulations Related to Online Games—Anti-addiction System and Protection of Minors.”

       Although we have implemented several measures and developed a detailed plan for system upgrade and are in the process of conducting various
system upgrading works according to the requirements under the relevant laws and regulations, we may be nevertheless considered non-compliant if the
regulators take a different view, or if our system is not fully upgraded by the end of the grace period, the length of which also remains uncertain at the
discretion of the relevant government authorities. Should the relevant government authorities find us not satisfying the requirements, they may order us
to rectify. In a severe case, our business license could be revoked, which may materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial
condition.

                                                                             28
Table of Contents

       In addition, there can be no assurance that the PRC regulators would not promulgate new laws and regulations in the future to further limit
minors’ access and exposure to videos, live broadcasting, audios and other content formats that we offer on our platform. The implementation of the
existing and future laws and regulations may lead to a decrease in the number of minors in our user base and the playtime of minor users, thereby
leading to a decrease in the minor users’ revenue contribution to our mobile game and other businesses and may materially and adversely affect our
results of operations and prospects. We currently do not charge users for game playing time. However, if we were to start charging for playing time, we
may lose our game players, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.


We face significant competition, primarily from companies that operate in the video-based industry in mainland China, and we compete with these
companies for users, content providers and advertisers.
       We face significant competition primarily from companies that operate in the video-based industry in mainland China designed to engage users,
especially Generation Z+, individuals in China born between 1985 and 2009, and capture their time spent on mobile devices and the internet. In
particular, our competitors mainly include large online video streaming platforms, other platforms offering video products, live broadcasting platforms,
game developers and other companies offering online content. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater
financial resources than we do, and in turn may be able to attract and retain more users, content partners and advertisers. Our competitors may compete
with us in a variety of ways, including by obtaining exclusive online distribution rights for popular content, conducting brand promotions and other
marketing activities, and making acquisitions. If any of our competitors provides comparable or better user experience, our user traffic could decline
significantly. We have exclusive distribution rights only for certain content on our platform. Our content creators are generally free to post their content
on our competitors’ platforms, which may divert user traffic from our platform, and adversely affect our user traffic and thus our operations. We believe
that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
       •     the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our platform, products and services compared to those of our
             competitors;
       •     the amount, quality and timeliness of content on our platform, especially the amount and quality of the PUGV generated by our content
             creators;
       •     the environment and culture of our user communities;
       •     our ability, and the ability of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services to
             keep up with user preferences and demands;
       •     the inventory size, quality and size of player base of the games we operate;
       •     our ability to establish and maintain relationships with content providers and partners;
       •     our ability to commercialize our services;
       •     changes mandated by legislation, regulations or government policies, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;
       •     acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and
       •     our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.

                                                                              29

We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could result in material damage to our reputation and
brand, payment of substantial damages, penalties and fines, removal of relevant content from our platform or seeking license arrangements which
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
      Content posted on our platform may expose us to allegations by third parties of infringement of intellectual property rights, unfair competition,
invasion of privacy, defamation and other violations of third-party rights. We have been involved in litigation based on allegations of infringement of
third-party copyright due to the content available on our platform. We are currently involved in approximately 200 lawsuits based on allegations of
infringement of third-party copyright due to the content posted on our platform, which are immaterial to our company on an individual basis or a
collective basis. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation that may be brought against us or our current or former directors and
officers, could be time-consuming, result in significant expenses and divert our resources and the attention of our management and other key employees.
An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed the limited coverage provided under our current applicable insurance policies.

       Our failure to identify unauthorized content posted on our platform may subject us to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property
rights or other rights. Although we maintain content management and review procedures to monitor the content uploaded to our platform, due to the
large number of videos, texts, and images uploaded, we may not be able to identify all content that may infringe on third-party rights. Such failure may
subject us to potential claims and lawsuits, defending of which may impose a significant burden on our management and employees, and there can be no
assurance that we will obtain final outcomes that are favorable to us. In addition, we may be subject to administrative actions brought by the National
Copyright Administration of China or its local branches or related law enforcement departments for alleged copyright infringement.

      The validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internet-related industries, particularly in mainland China, are
uncertain and still evolving. As we face increasing competition and as litigation becomes a more common way to resolve disputes in mainland China,
we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. Under relevant PRC laws and regulations, online service
providers which provide storage space for users to upload works or links to other services or content could be held liable for copyright infringement
under various circumstances, including situations where an online service provider knows or should reasonably have known that the relevant content
uploaded or linked to on its platform infringes the copyrights of others and the provider realizes economic benefits from such infringement activities. In
certain cases in mainland China, the courts have found an online service provider to be liable for the copyrighted content posted by users which was
accessible from and stored on such provider’s servers.

       Although we have not been subject to claims or lawsuits outside mainland China, we may become subject to copyright laws in other jurisdictions,
such as the United States, by virtue of our listing in the United States, the ability of users to access our videos from the United States and other
jurisdictions, the ownership of the ADSs by investors, and the extraterritorial application of foreign law by foreign courts or otherwise.

      In addition, as a publicly listed company, we may be exposed to increased risk of litigation. If a claim of infringement brought against us in the
United States or other jurisdictions is successful, we may be required to (i) pay substantial statutory or other damages and fines, (ii) remove relevant
content from our platform, or (iii) enter into royalty or license agreements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

       Although we have required our users to post only legally compliant and inoffensive materials and have set up screening procedures, our screening
procedures may fail to screen out all potentially offensive or non-compliant user-generated content and, even if properly screened, a third-party may still
find user-generated content posted on our platform offensive and take action against us in connection with the posting of such content. We may also face
litigation or administrative actions for defamation, negligence or other purported injuries resulting from the content we provide or the nature of our
services. Such litigation and administrative actions, with or without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming, result in significant diversion of
resources and management attention from our operations, and adversely affect our brand and reputation.

      Furthermore, our apps may be taken down temporarily from Apple app store or other apps markets for copyright reasons, and we may be subject
to copyright infringement claims brought by our competitors, which, malicious or not, may be time-consuming to defend and disrupting to our
operations.

                                                                              30

We may not be able to prevent others from engaging in unauthorized use of our intellectual property, unfair competition, defamation or other
violations of our rights, which could harm our business and competitive position.
      We have invested significant resources to develop our own intellectual property and acquire licenses to use and distribute the intellectual property
of others on our platform. Failure to maintain or protect these rights could harm our business. In addition, any unauthorized use of our intellectual
property by third parties may adversely affect our current and future revenues and our reputation. Further, others may engage in conduct that constitutes
unfair competition, defamation or other violations of our rights, which could harm our business, reputation and competitive position.

      Protection of intellectual property rights in the counties and regions that we operate may not be sufficient. Furthermore, policing unauthorized use
of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on
disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise
obtain and use our intellectual property or seek court declarations that they do not infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Other unlawful conduct
against us is also difficult to prevent and police. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our rights. From
time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.


We face intense competition for users and hosts for our live broadcasting business.
      We face significant competition in the live broadcasting business for both users and hosts. The live broadcasting on our platform primarily focuses
on interest areas including game, entertainment, e-sports and virtual live broadcasting. We cannot assure you that such content will continue to attract
new users and retain existing ones.

      We have entered into exclusive cooperation agreements with certain popular hosts on our platform. We may not be able to maintain or renew these
agreements on acceptable terms or at all. In such event, we may be unable to convert content creators to be live broadcasting hosts or retain these
popular hosts on our platform, and our operating results will be adversely affected. We cooperate with talent agencies to recruit, manage, train and
support our hosts. Furthermore, we may lose hosts if the talent agencies that manage them are unable to reach or maintain satisfactory cooperation
arrangements with such hosts. If talented and popular hosts cease to contribute content to our platform, or their live broadcasting fails to attract users, we
may experience a decline in user traffic and user engagement, which may have material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial
conditions.

       In addition, the costs attributed to hosts’ compensation have increased significantly in mainland China during the past few years for companies
that provide such services. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to outpace the increase in such compensation, we may lose opportunities to
retain the popular hosts on our platform and thus incur more losses. In addition, the compensation we pay to the hosts could significantly increase our
cost of revenues and materially adversely affect our margins, financial condition and results of operations.

       We cooperate with talent agencies to manage, organize and recruit hosts on our platform. As we are an open platform that welcomes all hosts to
register on our websites, cooperation with talent agencies substantially increases our operation efficiency in terms of discovering, supporting and
managing hosts in a more organized and structured manner, and turning amateur hosts to full-time hosts. We have a revenue sharing arrangement with
both our hosts and talent agencies under which we share with them a portion of the revenues from virtual gifting. The absolute amounts and revenue
sharing percentages that we pay hosts and talent agencies may increase. If the interests among us, hosts and the talent agencies are not well balanced, or
if we cannot design a revenue-sharing mechanism that is agreeable to both hosts and talent agencies, we may not be able to retain or attract hosts or
talent agencies, or both. In addition, while we have entered into exclusive streaming agreements with certain hosts, none of the talent agencies we
cooperate with has an exclusive cooperation relationship with us. If our competitor platforms offer higher revenue sharing percentages with an intent to
attract our popular hosts, costs to retain our hosts may further increase. Additionally, talent agencies may choose to devote more of their resources to
hosts who stream on other platforms, or they may encourage their hosts to use or even enter into an exclusive agreement with other platforms, all of
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to continue to retain our hosts
and produce high-quality content on our platform at commercially acceptable costs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
adversely impacted. Furthermore, as our business and user base further expand, we may have to devote more resources in encouraging our hosts and
talent agencies to produce content that meets the varied interests of a diverse user base, which would increase the content costs on our platform. If we
are unable to generate sufficient revenues that outpace our increased content costs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected.

                                                                             31

We face strict regulatory supervision by government authorities for our live broadcasting business.
      We face strict regulatory supervision for our live broadcasting business. In August 2018, the National Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal
Publication, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the National
Radio and Television Administration and the Cyberspace Administration of China jointly issued the Notice on Strengthening the Management of Live
Broadcasting Service, which required a real-name registration system for users to be put in place by live broadcasting service providers. Pursuant to the
Notice 78, users who have not registered with real names or who are minors are prohibited from virtual gifting. On October 17, 2020, the Law of the
PRC on the Protection of Minors (2020 Revision) added a new section entitled “Online Protections” which stipulates a series of provisions to further
protect minors’ interests on the internet. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—
Regulations Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.” On March 25, 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the State Taxation
Administration of the PRC and the SAMR jointly issued the Notice on Further Standardizing the Profit-Making Behavior of Live Broadcasting to
Promote the Healthy Development of the Industry, which required live broadcasting platforms to authenticate the identity of each live broadcasting
publisher and report various information of those publishers that have profit-making behaviors to local provincial-level network department and tax
authorities semi-annually. For a detailed description, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations
Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”

       We have implemented and we will continue to implement measures to comply with real-name registration requirements under PRC laws and
regulations. However, the PRC government may further tighten the real-name registration requirements or require us to implement a more thorough
compulsory real-name registration system for all users on our platform in the future, so that we will need to upgrade our system or purchase relevant
services from third-party service providers and incur additional costs in relation thereto. If we were required to implement a more rigid real-name
registration system for users on our platform, potential users may be deterred from registering with our platform, which may in turn negatively affect the
growth of our user base and prospect.

       In April 2022, the National Radio and Television Administration and Publication Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist
Party of China issued the notice on strengthening the management of live broadcasting of games on network audiovisual program platforms, which
stipulates that live broadcasting of games shall be reported to the administrative department of radio and television in accordance with the relevant
requirements for live programs. In May 2022, Opinions on Regulating Live Webcasts for Rewards and Enhancing the Protection of Minors was issued,
which states that minors are prohibited from participating in live broadcasting rewards. Furthermore, the website platform should strengthen the
management of the registration of anchor accounts and optimize the “teenage mode.” The website platform should establish a dedicated customer
service team for minors and strengthen the management of peak hours. The provision of online anchor services to minors under the age of 16 are
prohibited, and the provision of online anchor services to minors between the age of 16 and 18 shall be subject to the consent of their guardians. After
22:00 every day, the services under the “teenage mode” should be forced offline. In June 2022, the National Radio and Television Administration and
the Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued the Code of Conduct for Online Hosts, which requires live broadcasting platforms to review and record the
practice qualifications of live broadcasting hosts who require a high level of professionalism (e.g., healthcare, finance, law, education). Failure to
comply with these regulations may subject us to fines, other penalties and reputational harm.

       In addition, our live broadcasting services may be abused by hosts and other users. We have an internal control system in place to review and
monitor live broadcasting streams and will shut down those streams that may violate PRC laws and regulations. For detailed descriptions of these PRC
laws and regulations, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Live
Broadcasting Services.” However, we may not identify all such streams and content. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result
in the revocation of our licenses to provide internet content or other licenses, the closure of the concerned platforms and reputational harm. We may also
be held liable for such censored information displayed on our platform.

                                                                            32

If we fail to develop effective advertising products and systems or retain existing advertisers or attract new advertisers to advertise on our platform,
or if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from the advertisers or advertising agencies in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of
operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
      We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Our ability to generate and maintain our advertising revenues depends on a
number of factors, including the maintenance and enhancement of our brand, the scale, engagement and loyalty of our users and market competition on
advertising prices.

      We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing advertisers or advertising agencies or attract new ones. If we fail to retain and enhance
our relationships with third-party advertising agencies or advertisers themselves, our business, results of operations and prospects may be adversely
affected.

      We enter into contracts with both advertisers and third-party advertising agencies, and the financial soundness of these customers may affect our
collection of accounts receivable. We make a credit assessment of the advertiser and advertising agency to evaluate the collectability of the advertising
service fees before entering into an advertising contract. However, we cannot assure you that we are or will be able to accurately assess the
creditworthiness of each advertiser or advertising agency, and any inability of advertisers or advertising agencies to pay us in a timely manner may
adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows.


We face intense competition for advertising spending.
      We face significant competition for advertising spending. We compete against online and mobile businesses and internet companies that offer
advertising and marketing services, as well as traditional media outlets, such as television, radio and other offline advertising networks for advertising
and marketing budgets.

       In order to grow our advertising revenues, we must increase our market share of advertising spending relative to our competitors, many of which
are large companies that have substantially broader product or service offerings and may leverage their relationships based on other products and
services to gain additional share of advertising budgets.

      We believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertising spending depends on many factors within and beyond our control, including:
       •     the size, composition and activeness of our user base relative to those of our competitors;
       •     the comprehensiveness, innovation and effectiveness of our product and service offerings, especially those of our performance-based
             advertisements relative to those of our competitors;
       •     the volume, pricing and return on investment of our products and services relative to those of our competitors;
       •     the reach, engagement and effectiveness of our advertising solutions and services relative to those of our competitors;
       •     the strength of our brand and reputation relative to our competitors;
       •     the availability, accuracy and utility of analytics and measurement solutions and
       •     our sales and marketing efforts, and those of our competitors.

      If we are not able to compete effectively for advertising spending, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In
addition, as is common in the industry, many of our existing advertisers or advertising agencies do not have long-term commitments with us. They may
not continue to do business with us or may only be willing to advertise with us at reduced prices if we do not deliver advertising services in an effective
manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to alternative platforms.

                                                                              33

Advertising content shown on our platform may subject us to penalties and other administrative actions.
      Under PRC advertising laws and regulations, we are obligated to monitor the advertising content shown on our platform to ensure that such
content is true and accurate and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, where a special government review is required for
specific types of advertisements prior to internet posting, such as advertisements relating to pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals and
veterinary pharmaceuticals, we are obligated to confirm that such review has been performed and approval has been obtained. Violation of these laws
and regulations may subject us to penalties, including imposition of fines, confiscation of our advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the
advertisements, orders to publish an announcement correcting the misleading information, orders to terminate advertising operations and revocation of
business licenses.

       We face significant challenges in monitoring advertising content on our platform. We cannot assure you that we can identify all content that
constitute advertisements on our platform. Recent trends in advertising, such as the proliferation of short videos, live broadcasting programs, native
advertising and the inclusion of promotions, sponsorships or other advertisements in videos (pre, mid, and post rolls), with paid promotions that are
frequently not marked as advertising, have made advertising content identification and monitoring more challenging. Technologies and tools attempting
to circumvent, evade or deceive our advertisement content monitoring system are evolving, which makes it more complicated for us to identify, monitor
and review the advertising content on our platform. While we have made significant efforts to ensure that the advertisements shown on our platform are
in full compliance with applicable PRC laws and regulations, we cannot ensure all the content contained in advertisements to be true and accurate as
required by the advertising laws and regulations, especially given the uncertainty in the interpretation of these PRC laws and regulations. If we are found
to be in violation of applicable PRC advertising laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties and our reputation may be harmed, which may
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.


If we fail to launch new games or release upgrades to existing games to grow our games’ player base, our business and operating results will be
materially and adversely affected.
      We derived 26.3%, 22.9% and 17.8% of our revenues from mobile games in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. No mobile game individually
contributed more than 10% of our total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Our revenues from mobile
games decreased by 19.9% from RMB5,021.3 million in 2022 to RMB4,021.1 million (US$566.4 million) in 2023, which was mainly attributable to
fewer new game launches as well as lower revenue contributions from certain games, while revenues from our top-performing legacy games, like Azur
Lane and Fate/Grand Order, remained relatively stable in 2023. If we further fail to launch new games or release upgrades to existing games in a timely
manner, or if our games do not achieve expected popularity, we may lose players of our games, which could materially and adversely impact revenues
from mobile games and our business operations. Even in the event that we succeed in launching new games, the new games may divert players away
from the existing games on our platform, which may increase player churn and reduce revenues from our existing games.

      We offer mobile games mostly from third-party game developers and publishers on our platform either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.
Therefore, we must maintain good relationships with our third-party game developers and copyright owners to obtain access to new popular games on
reasonable commercial terms. We may not be able to maintain or renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all. In such event, we may be unable
to continue offering these popular mobile games, and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, if our users decide to access these
games through our competitors, or if they prefer other mobile games operated by our competitors, our operating results could be materially and
adversely affected.

      We also offer mobile games developed by our in-house game development teams. The development cycle for new titles can range from 12 months
to multiple years. Therefore, our development costs can be substantial. If we experience unanticipated development delays, financial difficulties, or
additional costs, we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs. External factors, such as changing interests and
appetite of game players and market trends, may also have an impact on the successful launch and popularity of any new games. Despite the substantial
costs and time needed for development of new games, there can be no assurance that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these games.

                                                                            34

      In addition, the revenue model we adopt for online games may not remain effective, which may cause us to lose players and materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2023, we incurred expenses of RMB354.8 million (US$50.0 million) in
association with the termination of certain game projects. We derive substantially all of the mobile games revenues from the sale of in-game virtual
items. However, we may not be able to continue to successfully implement this model.

      We are not able to predict if or when we will commercially launch new games and the pace at which our new games will penetrate the online
game market in China, if at all. A number of factors, including technical difficulties, lack of sufficient game development capabilities, personnel and
other resources and failure to obtain, delays in obtaining or revocation of obtained governmental authorities’ approvals could result in delayed launch of
new games, the cancellation of the development of our pipeline games, or the termination of the operation of existing games. Any delays in game
releases or problems arising following the commercial release of one or more new online games such as programming errors, or bugs, could negatively
impact our business and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations. If any of these issues occurs,
players may stop playing online games on our platform and may be less likely to return to such games as often in the future, which may negatively
impact our business.


Our ability to generate revenues from our mobile games could suffer if mobile games market in mainland China does not develop as anticipated.
       The mobile games market in mainland China has evolved rapidly in recent years, with developments such as the introduction of new business
models, the development of player preferences, the increasing popularity of smartphones, market entry by new competitors and the adoption of new
strategies by existing competitors. We expect each of these trends to continue, and we must continue to adapt our strategy to successfully compete in this
market. There are numerous other technologies and business models in varying stages of development, such as portable tablet computers, cloud games
and VR games involving new mobile technologies, which could render certain current technologies or applications obsolete. Accordingly, it is extremely
difficult to accurately predict player acceptance and demand for our various existing and potential new mobile game offerings, and the future size,
composition and growth of this market. Furthermore, given the limited history and rapidly evolving nature of the mobile games market, we cannot
predict the price that players will be willing to pay for the virtual items in our mobile games or whether players will have concerns over security,
reliability, cost and quality of service associated with mobile games. If market acceptance of our mobile games is different than anticipated, our ability
to maintain or increase our revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected.


Illegal game servers and acts of cheating by users of mobile games could harm our business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our
results of operations.
      Several of our competitors have reported that certain third parties have misappropriated the source codes of their games and set up illegal game
servers and let their customers play such games on illegal servers without paying for the game playing time. While we already have in place numerous
internal control measures to protect the source codes of our games from being stolen and to address illegal server usage and, to date, our games have not,
to our knowledge, experienced such usage, our preventive measures may not be effective. The misappropriation of our game server installation software
and installation of illegal game servers could harm our business and reputation and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

       In addition, acts of cheating by users of mobile games could lessen the popularity of our mobile games and adversely affect our reputation and our
results of operations. There have been a number of incidents in previous years where users, through a variety of methods, were able to modify the rules
of our mobile games. Although these users did not gain authorized access to our systems, they were able to modify the rules of our mobile games during
gameplay in a manner that allowed them to cheat and disadvantage our other mobile game users, which often has the effect of causing players to stop
playing the game and shortening the game’s lifecycle. Although we have taken a number of steps to deter our users from engaging in cheating when
playing our mobile games, we cannot assure you that we or the third parties from whom we license some of our mobile games will be successful or
timely in taking steps necessary to prevent users from modifying the rules of our mobile games.

                                                                            35
Table of Contents

      If we suspect a player of installing cheating programs on our mobile games, or of engaging in other types of unauthorized activities, we may
freeze that player’s game account or even ban the player from logging on to our games and other products. Such activities to regulate the behavior of our
users are essential to maintain a fair playing environment for our users. However, if any of our regulatory activities are found to be wrongly
implemented, our users may institute legal proceedings against us for damages or claims. Our operation, business and financial performance may be
materially and adversely affected as a result.


We rely on third-party logistics services for the fulfillment and delivery relating to the sales of IP derivative products on our platform, and if such
third-party logistics service providers fail to provide reliable logistics services, our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.
      We offer IP derivative merchandise related to the ACG (anime, comics, and games) subculture as well as other areas of popular culture on our
platform and generate revenues from sales of these products. We use third-party logistics service providers to fulfill orders generated on our platform.
Any interruption to or failure in logistics services could prevent the timely or proper delivery of these products. These interruptions may be due to
events that are beyond our control or the control of these third-party logistics service providers, such as pandemic, inclement weather, natural disasters,
transportation interruptions or labor unrest or shortage. We may not be able to find alternative logistics service providers to provide logistics services in
a timely and reliable manner, or at all, to replace such third-party logistics service providers to the extent necessary. If products sold on our platform are
not delivered in proper condition or on a timely basis or at all, our business and reputation would suffer.


We rely upon our partner to deliver our services through smart TV.
       In smart TV video streaming market, only a small number of qualified license holders can provide internet audio and visual program service to the
TV terminal users via smart TVs, set-top boxes and other electronic products. Most of those license holders are radio or TV stations. Private companies
that wish to operate such business need to cooperate with those license holders to legally provide relevant services. We cooperate with a PRC licensed
entity for the development of relevant programs and provision of audio-visual program services through private network and targeted communication
channels, such as smart TVs. If we are not successful in maintaining existing or creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content
licensing, regulatory or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to grow our business may
be adversely impacted.


Many of our products and services contain open-source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products and services
in a manner that negatively affects our business.
      We use open-source software in our products and services and will use open-source software in the future. There is a risk that open-source
software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products
or services. Additionally, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open-source software or derivative
works that we developed using such software. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely
available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement.
This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully.

      Furthermore, because any software source code we contribute to open-source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual
property rights with respect to such software source code may be limited or lost entirely. As a result, we may be unable to prevent our competitors or
others from using such software source code contributed by us.


We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing services that operate effectively
with these operating systems, networks, devices and standards.
       We make our products and services available across a variety of operating systems, mainly on mobile devices and personal computers. As mobile
usage accelerates, we expect to generate a large portion of our business and revenues from mobile. If we are unable to successfully capture and retain the
growing number of users that access internet services through mobile devices, or if we are slower than our competitors in developing attractive products
and services adaptable for mobile devices, we may fail to capture a significant share or an increasingly important portion of the market or may lose
existing users. In addition, even if we are able to retain the increasing number of mobile users, we may not be able to continue to successfully
commercialize mobile user traffic in the future.

                                                                              36
Table of Contents

      We depend on the interoperability of our products and services with popular devices, desktop and mobile operating systems and web browsers that
we do not control, such as Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, and others. Any changes in devices or their systems that degrade the functionality of our
products and services or give preferential treatment to competitive products or services could adversely affect usage of our products and services. We
may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing services that operate effectively with
these operating systems, networks, devices and standards. Further, if the number of systems, networks and devices for which we develop our products
and services increases, it will result in an increase in our costs and expenses, and adversely affect our gross margin and results of operation.


We face risks associated with our investments.
       We have made short-term and long-term investments. Our short-term investments primarily include financial products with variable interest rates
referenced to the performance of underlying assets issued by commercial banks, other financial institutions or publicly traded companies, which we
intend to sell within twelve months. Our long-term investments primarily consist of (i) investment in companies whose businesses are complementary to
ours, including game, anime production and high-technology companies and (ii) investments in publicly traded companies with an intention of holding
for more than one year.

       These investments may earn yields substantially lower than anticipated and the fair value of our investments may fluctuate significantly, which
contribute to the uncertainties in valuation. Any failure to realize the benefits we expected from these investments may materially and adversely affect
our business and financial results. From time to time, we may also make alternative investments and enter into strategic partnerships or alliances as we
see fit to expand our product offerings or business in other countries or regions, which may expose us to additional risks. Also see “—We face various
challenges and risks in connection with our expansion into overseas markets.”

      Any change in securities prices and market conditions could lead to volatility in the fair value of our investments accounted for at fair value,
which could further impact our financial condition and results of operations and may also impact our ability to dispose of these investments at favorable
prices.


Difficulties in identifying, consummating and integrating acquisitions and strategic alliances and potential impair in connection with our
investments or acquisitions may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
      We have acquired, and may in the future acquire, companies that are complementary to our business. From time to time, we may also make
alternative investments and enter into strategic partnerships or alliances as we see. For example, in November 2021, we acquired all of the equity
interests in Beijing Siyuexingkong Network Technology Co., Ltd., a comics distribution company, to enrich our content offerings. In February 2022, we
acquired all of the equity interests in a game company to expand our in-house capacity in game development.

      Past and future acquisitions, partnerships or alliances may expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with:
       •     the integration of new operations and the retention of customers and personnel;
       •     significant volatility in our operating profit (loss) due to changes in the fair value of our contingent purchase consideration payable;
             unforeseen or hidden liabilities, including those associated with different business practices;
       •     the diversion of management’s attention and resources from our existing business and technology by acquisition, transition and integration
             activities;
       •     failure to achieve synergies with our existing business and generate revenues as anticipated;
       •     failure of the newly acquired businesses, technologies, services and products to perform as anticipated;
       •     inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset additional costs and expenses;

                                                                             37
Table of Contents

       •     breach or termination of key agreements by the counterparties;
       •     the costs of acquisitions;
       •     international operations conducted by some of our subsidiaries;
       •     any different interpretations on contingent purchase consideration; or
       •     the potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with both our employees and customers resulting from our integration of new businesses.

      Any of the potential risks listed above could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to manage our business and our results of operation.
In addition, we cannot be assured the acquired businesses, technologies, services and products from our past acquisitions and any potential transaction
will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other potential unforeseen adverse effects on our business.


We may incur impairment charges for our intangible assets and goodwill.
       Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from the acquired entity as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. We recorded goodwill
of RMB2,338.3 million, RMB2,725.1 million and RMB2,725.1 million (US$383.8 million) as of December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

      We are required to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be
impaired. We may record impairment of goodwill acquired in connection with our acquisitions if the carrying value of our goodwill acquired in
connection with our past or future acquisitions are determined to be impaired.

       Our intangible assets consist primarily of licensed copyrights of content, license rights of mobile games, and intellectual property and others.
Purchased intangible assets are initially recognized and measured at fair value. Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions are recognized
as assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-legal” or “separability” criterion. Intangible assets are subsequently measured at
cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets should be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. We cannot guarantee that we will not record greater impairment losses of
intangible assets in the future. Material impairment of intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.


We are exposed to risks associated with the development or construction of properties on a parcel of land in Shanghai.
      In 2020, we established an entity together with two entities each controlled by Mr. Rui Chen and Ms. Ni Li, and an independent third party to
acquire the land use rights for a parcel of land in Shanghai. We hold 30.01% of the shares of this entity. Construction of certain buildings on this parcel
of land has commenced and is expected to complete by approximately 2026. We may use space in one of the buildings as our office space following the
completion of this construction project. See also “Item 4. Information on the Company—Property, Plants and Equipment” and “Item 7. Major
Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Other Related Party Transactions.”

      This construction project includes risks such as:
       •     this entity may not be able to obtain construction financing for the development of the construction project on reasonable terms in a timely
             manner, or at all, and we may consider to provide additional financing to this entity to fund the development or construction;
       •     construction may not be completed on schedule due to various reasons, such as supply chain issues and increased difficulty for workforce
             recruitment, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability;

                                                                             38

       •     construction costs may exceed this entity’s original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased material, labor or other costs,
             possibly making the property less profitable than projected or unprofitable because this entity may not be able to increase rents to
             compensate for the increase in construction costs;
       •     occupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties and the time it takes to lease such facilities fully or substantially may not meet
             this entity’s expectations, which may result in lower than projected occupancy and rental rates resulting in an investment that is less
             profitable than projected or unprofitable;
       •     claims for construction defects after a property has been developed;
       •     poor performance or nonperformance by any of our business partners or other third parties on whom we rely;
       •     health and safety incidents and site accidents; and
       •     compliance with building codes and other local regulations.

      If any of the aforementioned risks were to occur, it could have a substantial negative impact on the construction project’s success and result in a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.


Any malfunction, capacity constraint or operation interruption for any extended period may have an adverse impact on our business.
       Our ability to provide superior user experience on our platform depends on the continuous and reliable operation of our IT systems. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to procure sufficient bandwidth in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to do so may significantly
impair user experience on our platform and decrease the overall effectiveness of our platform to users, content providers and advertisers. Our IT systems
and proprietary content distribution network are vulnerable to damage or interruption as a result of fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses,
telecommunications failures, undetected errors in software, computer viruses, hacking and other attempts to harm our IT systems. Disruptions, failures,
unscheduled service interruptions or a decrease in connection speeds could damage our reputation and cause our users, content providers and advertisers
to migrate to our competitors’ platforms. If we experience frequent or persistent service disruptions, whether caused by failures of our own IT systems
or those of third-party service providers, our user experience may be negatively affected, which in turn may have a material and adverse effect on our
reputation and business. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in minimizing the frequency or duration of service interruptions. As the
number of our users increases and our users generate more content on our platform, we may be required to expand and adapt our technology and
infrastructure to reliably store and process content. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the performance of our platform,
especially during peak usage times, as our services become more complex and our user traffic increases.


Undetected programming errors or flaws or failure to maintain effective customer service could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance
of our products and services, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
       The video programs on our platform may contain programming errors that may only become apparent after their release. We generally have been
able to resolve such flaws and errors. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to detect and resolve all these programming errors effectively.
Undetected programming errors could adversely affect our user experience and market acceptance.

      Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, errors, bugs or vulnerabilities. Any errors, bugs or vulnerabilities discovered in
our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of content providers, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of
which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

                                                                             39

We utilize payment collection channels to collect proceeds from our paying users’ purchases. Any failure by those payment collection channels to
process payments effectively and securely may materially and adversely affect our revenue realization and brand recognition.
      We depend on the billing and payment systems of third parties such as online third-party payment processors to maintain accurate records of
payments of sales proceeds by paying users and collect such payments. We receive periodic statements from these third parties which indicate the
aggregate amount of fees that were charged to paying users of our products and services. Our business and results of operations could be adversely
affected if these third parties fail to accurately account for or calculate the revenues generated from the sales of our products and services. If there are
security breaches or failure or errors in the payment process of these third parties, user experience may be affected and our business results may be
negatively impacted.

       Failure to timely collect our receivables from third parties whose billing and payment systems we use and third-party payment processors may
adversely affect our cash flows. Our third-party payment processors may from time to time experience cash flow difficulties. Consequently, they may
delay their payments to us or fail to pay us at all. Any delay in payment or inability of current or potential third-party payment processors to pay us may
significantly harm our cash flow and results of operations.

      We also do not have control over the security measures of our third-party payment service providers, and security breaches of the online payment
systems that we use could expose us to litigation and possible liability for failing to secure confidential customer information and could, among other
things, damage our reputation and the perceived security of all of the online payment systems that we use. If a well-publicized internet security breach
were to occur, users concerned about the security of their online payments may become reluctant to purchase our products through payment service
providers even if the publicized breach did not involve payment systems or methods we used. In addition, billing software errors could damage user
confidence in these payment systems. If any of the above were to occur and damage our reputation or the perceived security of the payment systems we
use, we may lose paying users as they may be discouraged from purchasing products or services on our platform, which may have an adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.


Our success depends on the efforts of our key employees, including our senior management members and other technology personnel. If we fail to
hire, retain and motivate our key employees, our business may suffer.
       We depend on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key employees, many of whom are difficult to replace. The loss of
the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. Competition for qualified talent in mainland China is
intense, particularly in the internet and technology industries. Our future success depends on our ability to attract a large number of qualified employees
and retain existing key employees. If we are unable to do so, our business and growth may be materially and adversely affected and the trading prices of
our listed securities could suffer. Our need to obtain qualified employees and retain key employees may cause us to increase compensation-related costs,
including stock-based compensation.


If we are deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it could adversely affect the price of the ADSs, could
constrain our future activities, and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
      We do not believe that we are an “investment company” and we do not intend to become registered as an “investment company” under the U.S.
Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act. Certain of our assets and other future holdings may be deemed to be “investment securities” within
the meaning of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, a company is deemed to be an “investment company” if it is engaged primarily, or proposes to engage
primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. On a consolidated basis, a significant portion of our present
assets as of December 31, 2023 consists of time deposits and short-term investments held for cash management purposes, which may be deemed to be
“investment securities” within the meaning of 1940 Act. However, we do not hold ourselves out as being primarily engaged, or proposing to engage
primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we are primarily engaged in the business of building a leading video
community for young generations in China.

                                                                              40
Table of Contents

       We seek to conduct our operations so that we do not meet the definition of “investment company” under the 1940 Act. Doing so may require us to
forego potential future acquisitions of interests in companies that may be deemed to be “investment securities” within the meaning of the 1940 Act. If
we are unable to structure or operate our business in a manner that avoids investment company status under the 1940 Act, we may be deemed to be an
investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As a foreign private issuer, we would not be eligible to register under the 1940 Act unless the
SEC issued an order permitting us to do so. As a result, if we are deemed to be an investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, we would
either have to obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or dispose of investment securities in order to fall outside the definition of an investment company.
Failure to avoid being deemed an investment company under the 1940 Act, coupled with our inability as a foreign private issuer to register under the
1940 Act, could make us unable to comply with our reporting obligations as a public company in the United States and lead to our being delisted from
the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which would materially and adversely affect the liquidity and value of the ADSs. We would also be unable to raise
capital through the sale of securities in the United States or to conduct business in the United States. In addition, we may be subject to SEC enforcement
action or purported class action lawsuits for alleged violations of U.S. securities laws. Defending ourselves against any such enforcement action or
lawsuits would require significant attention from our management and divert resources from our existing businesses and could materially and adversely
affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.


If we cannot obtain sufficient cash when we need it, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our convertible senior notes.
      In April 2019, we issued US$500 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026, which we refer to as April 2026
Notes in this annual report. The April 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.375% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of
each year, beginning on October 1, 2019, and will mature on April 1, 2026 (unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted). In June 2020, we issued
US$800 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2027, which we refer to as 2027 Notes in this annual report. The 2027
Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15,
2020, and will mature on June 15, 2027 (unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted). In November 2021, we issued US$1,600 million in
aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026, which we refer to as December 2026 notes in this annual report. The December 2026
Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.5% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2022, and
will mature on December 1, 2026 (unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted). The April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes are
collectively referred to as the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes in this annual report on Form 20-F.

    As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes was
US$861.8 million (RMB6.1 billion).

       As of the date of this annual report, holders of the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on
April 1, 2024 in the case of the April 2026 Notes, June 15, 2025 in the case of the 2027 Notes, and December 1, 2024 in the case of the December 2026
Notes. In addition, each of the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes contains similar provisions concerning the holders’ right to require us to repurchase
their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the terms of such notes), as well as similar provisions regarding our ability to
redeem the existing notes in case of certain changes in tax law. Each of the indentures for the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes defines a “fundamental
change” to include, among other things, Bilibili’s ADSs ceasing to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the
Nasdaq Global Market. For example, our ADSs may be prohibited from being traded in the United States under the HFCAA in the future due to
regulatory reasons and our ADSs may cease to be listed as a result, which in turn may trigger a fundamental change. See “—Risks Related to Doing
Business in China—Our ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the
HFCAA, in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of
their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.” Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the
Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes or any
portion of the principal amount at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any. In the event of a fundamental change, we may also be required to issue additional ADSs or, in the case of the December 2026 Notes,
Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of ADSs if a holder of the December 2026 Notes so elects, upon conversion of the relevant Bilibili Convertible Senior
Notes. In addition, upon conversion of the December 2026 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely ADSs (or Class Z ordinary shares if such holder
elects to receive Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion) to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of
delivering any fractional ADS), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted.

                                                                            41

       However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the notes
surrendered therefor or redeem the notes or the notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes, redeem the notes or pay cash upon
conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our and/or our subsidiaries’ current or future
indebtedness. We derive most of our revenues from, and hold most of our assets through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we may rely in part upon
distributions and advances from our subsidiaries in order to help us meet our payment obligations under the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes and our
other obligations. Our subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and do not have any obligation (legal or otherwise) to provide us with distributions or
advances. We may face tax or other adverse consequences, or legal limitations, on our ability to obtain funds from these entities. In addition, our ability
to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:
       •     our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;
       •     general market conditions for financing activities by internet companies; and
       •     economic, political and other conditions in the PRC and elsewhere.

      Our failure to repurchase the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes or pay the redemption price or repay the principal at a time when the repurchase or
such payment is required by the respective indenture governing the notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes would constitute
a default under the respective indenture governing the notes. A default under any of these indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to
a default under any of the other indentures or agreements governing our indebtedness or any future indebtedness. If the repayment of the existing notes
or any other indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the existing
notes or other indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.


We hold a portion of our cash and cash equivalents that we use to meet our working capital and operating expense needs in deposit accounts, and
our liquidity and operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution holding such funds fails.
       We hold a portion of our cash and cash equivalents that we use to meet our working capital and operating expense needs in deposit accounts at
multiple financial institutions. The balance held in the accounts of U.S. financial institutions typically exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation standard deposit insurance limit of $250,000 per depositor and per institution. If a U.S. financial institution in which we hold such funds
fails or is subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of such
uninsured funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of our funds. Any such loss or lack of access to these funds could adversely impact
our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our operating expense obligations, including payroll obligations.

       For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was closed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was appointed receiver for the
bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation created a successor bridge bank, and all deposits were transferred to the bridge bank under a systemic
risk exception approved by the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Access to
and availability of deposits was delayed, though ultimately, in that case, restored. As of the date of this annual report, we have no balance left in Silicon
Valley Bank. However, if financial institutions in which we hold funds for working capital and operating expenses were to fail, we cannot provide any
assurances that the applicable governmental agencies would take action to protect our uninsured deposits or make deposits available in a similar manner.

       We also maintain investment accounts with one or more financial institutions in which we hold our investments and, if access to the funds we use
for working capital and operating expenses is impaired, we may not be able to open new operating accounts or to sell investments or transfer funds from
our investment accounts to new operating accounts on a timely basis sufficient to meet our operating expense obligations. In addition, to the extent that
the financial institutions with which we hold securities fail or are associated with banks that fail, there may be delays or other access restrictions with
respect to such securities, similar to those described above for deposit accounts.

                                                                              42

We have granted, and may continue to grant, options and other types of awards under our share incentive plan, which may result in increased
share-based compensation expenses.
       We adopted a global share incentive plan in 2014 (terminated in 2022, whereas awards outstanding at the time of termination survived the
termination) and a share incentive plan in 2018 (as amended in 2020 and 2022), which we refer to as the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan,
respectively, in this annual report, for the purpose of granting share-based compensation awards to employees, directors and consultants to incentivize
their performance and align their interests with ours. We recognize expenses in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Under the 2018 Plan, we are authorized to grant options and other types of awards. As of February 29, 2024, awards to purchase 26,971,191 ordinary
shares under the Global Share Plan and the 2018 Plan have been granted and remained outstanding, excluding awards that were forfeited or cancelled
after the relevant grant dates. We recognize share-based compensation expenses in our consolidated financial statements in connection with these grants
and may continue to incur such expenses in the future. As of December 31, 2023, our unrecognized share-based compensation expenses relating to
unvested awards amounted to RMB3,187.9 million (US$449.0 million), adjusted for estimated forfeitures.


If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may lose investor confidence in the reliability of our
financial statements which in turn could negatively impact the trading price of our shares and/or ADSs or otherwise harm our reputation.
       The SEC, as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of
management on the effectiveness of such companies’ internal control over financial reporting in their respective annual reports. In addition, an
independent registered public accounting firm for a public company may be required to issue an attestation report on the effectiveness of such
company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.
Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting
firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which
our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, as we have
become a public company, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems
for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation.

      If we fail to implement and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading prices of our listed
securities. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and
subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanction.


We rely on certain key operating metrics to evaluate the performance of our business, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm
our reputation and negatively affect our business.
      We rely on certain key operating metrics to evaluate the performance of our business. Our operating metrics may differ from estimates published
by third parties or from similarly titled metrics used by other companies due to differences in methodology and assumptions. We calculate these
operating metrics using internal company data that have not been independently verified. If we discover material inaccuracies in the operating metrics
we use, or if they are perceived to be inaccurate, our reputation may be harmed and our evaluation methods and results may be impaired, which could
negatively affect our business. If investors make investment decisions based on operating metrics we disclose that are inaccurate, we may also face
potential lawsuits or disputes.

                                                                               43

We do not have any business insurance coverage.
       The insurance industry in mainland China is still in an early stage of development, and insurance companies in mainland China currently offer
limited business-related insurance products. We do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we
maintain property insurance, product liability insurance or key-man insurance. We consider this practice to be reasonable in light of the nature of our
business and the insurance products that are available in mainland China and in line with the practices of other companies in the same industry of similar
size in mainland China. Any uninsured risks may result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.


We face various challenges and risks in connection with our expansion into overseas markets.
      As we expand our global and cross-border businesses into more overseas markets, we will face risks associated with expanding into markets in
which we have limited or no experience and in which we may be less well-known. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of users, customers
or business partners, fail to anticipate competitive conditions or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets. The expansion of our
overseas and cross-border businesses will also expose us to risks inherent in operating businesses globally, including, but not limited to:
       •     inability to recruit international and local talent and deal with challenges in replicating or adapting our company policies and procedures to
             operating environments different than those of China;
       •     lack of acceptance of the product and service offerings on our platform;
       •     disruptions in the supply chain;
       •     investigations regarding anti-dumping;
       •     trade wars;
       •     geopolitical tensions, political instability and general economic or political conditions in particular countries or regions;
       •     challenges and increased expenses associated with staffing and managing global and cross-border operations and managing an organization
             spread over multiple jurisdictions;
       •     trade barriers, such as import and export restrictions, tariffs, customs duties and other taxes, competition law regimes and other trade
             restrictions, as well as other protectionist policies;
       •     differing and potentially adverse tax consequences;
       •     increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements;
       •     adaption to different industry practices;
       •     challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;
       •     impact of natural disasters or health epidemics;
       •     increased costs to protect the security and stability of our information technology systems, intellectual property and personal data,
             including compliance costs related to data localization laws;
       •     availability and reliability of global and cross-border payment systems and logistics infrastructure; and
       •     exchange rate fluctuations.

                                                                             44

      As we expand further into new regions and markets, these risks could intensify, and efforts we make to expand our global and cross-border
businesses and operations may not be successful. Failure to expand our global and cross-border businesses and operations could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

     Transactions conducted through our global and cross-border platforms may be subject to different customs, taxes and rules and regulations, and
we may be adversely affected by the complexity of and developments in customs, foreign exchange and import/export laws, rules and regulations in
mainland China and other jurisdictions.

      In addition, changes to trade policies, treaties and tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or the perception that these changes could occur,
could adversely affect our global and cross-border operations, our financial condition and results of operations.


We are subject to changing laws and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both
our costs and the risk of non-compliance.
      We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is
charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, the Securities and Futures Commission of
Hong Kong, which is in charge of regulating Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets, and the various regulatory authorities in mainland China,
Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable laws. Our efforts to comply with new and changing
laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of
management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

      Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time
as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated
by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes,
we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.

      The new PRC Company Law, with effect from July 1, 2024, will affect many critical aspects of corporate establishment, operations and
governance. Shareholders of a company must fully pay in their subscribed registered capital within five years from the date of establishment of this
company, and companies established before July 1, 2024 shall gradually adjust their capital contribution to meet this new requirement. This law also
imposes greater personal liability for directors, supervisors and management. Violation of the PRC Company Law could subject us to sanctions and
penalties, including fines, orders to correct and public announcements of violations. Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and
implementation of the PRC Company Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business
operations.


A severe or prolonged downturn in the Chinese or global economy, any financial or economic crisis, or perceived threat of such a crisis, could
materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
       COVID-19 had a severe and negative impact on the Chinese and the global economy from 2020 through 2022, and the global macroeconomic
environment still faces numerous challenges. The growth rate of the Chinese economy has been slowing since 2010 and the Chinese population began to
decline in 2022. The Federal Reserve and other central banks outside of China have raised interest rates. Heightened geopolitical tensions in various
regions of the world may have negative effects to the global economy. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between
the United States and China with respect to a wide range of issues including trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Economic
conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or
perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may materially and adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

                                                                              45

We face risks related to natural disasters and health epidemics.
       Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, health epidemics, or other public safety concerns affecting the PRC, and particularly
Shanghai. Natural disasters, such as severe weather conditions, a snowstorm, flood or hazardous air pollution, or other outbreaks, to server interruptions,
breakdowns, system failures, website or app failures or internet failures, which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or
hardware, as well as adversely affecting our ability to operate our website or apps and provide services and solutions. Our business could also be
adversely affected if our employees are affected by health epidemics, such as new variants of COVID-19 or outbreaks of other diseases. In addition, our
results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that any health epidemic harms the Chinese economy in general. Our headquarters are
located in mainland China, where most of our directors and management and many of our employees currently reside. Most of our system hardware and
back-up systems are hosted in facilities located in mainland China. Consequently, if any natural disasters, health epidemics or other public safety
concerns were to affect mainland China, our operation may experience material disruptions, which may materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.


Our ability to conduct business in international markets may be adversely affected by legal, regulatory and other risks.
       International expansion of our platform and offerings is a part of our growth strategy and may subject us to additional risks and challenges,
including, but not limited to, challenges in formulating effective local sales and marketing strategies targeting users from various jurisdictions and
cultures, who have a diverse range of preferences and demands; challenges in achieving sufficient brand recognition as compared with our home market
in China; challenges in identifying appropriate local business partners and establishing and maintaining good working relationships with them; exposure
to different tax jurisdictions that may subject us to greater fluctuations in our effective tax rate and potentially adverse tax consequence; and risks of
increased costs associated with doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including burdens of complying with a wide variety of local laws and regulations.
If we fail to address any of these risks and challenges associated with our international expansion, our reputation, business and results of operations may
be adversely affected.


Any failure to comply with PRC property laws and relevant regulations regarding certain of our leased premises may materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
      We have not registered our lease agreements with the relevant government authorities. Under the relevant PRC laws and regulations, we may be
required to register and file with the relevant government authority executed leases. The failure to register the lease agreements for our leased properties
will not affect the validity of these lease agreements, but the competent housing authorities may order us to register the lease agreements in a prescribed
period of time and impose a fine ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 for each non-registered lease if we fail to complete the registration within the
prescribed timeframe.


Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our businesses in mainland China do not comply with
PRC regulations on foreign investment in internet and other related businesses, or if these regulations or their interpretation change in the future,
we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.
       PRC laws and regulations impose certain restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in internet and other related
businesses, including the provision of internet content and online game operations. For example, the internet cultural business (except for music), the
internet audio-visual program business, the radio and television program production and operation business, and the production of audio-visual products
and/or electronic publications remain as prohibited areas for foreign investment. Specifically, foreign ownership of a commercial internet information
services provider may not exceed 50%. We are a company registered in the Cayman Islands and our WFOE is considered a foreign-invested enterprise.
To comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our business in mainland China mainly through the VIEs and their respective subsidiaries, based
on a series of contractual arrangements by and among our wholly owned subsidiaries in mainland China (our WFOEs), the VIEs, and their shareholders,
as applicable. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we exert control over the Consolidated Affiliated Entities and consolidate their financial
results in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The Consolidated Affiliated Entities hold the licenses, approvals and key assets that are essential
for our operations.

                                                                             46
Table of Contents

       In the opinion of our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, based on its understanding of the relevant PRC laws and regulations, except as
disclosed in this annual report, each of the contracts among our WFOEs, the VIEs and their shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with its terms.

       However, Bilibili is a Cayman Islands holding company with no equity ownership in the VIEs and conducts its operations primarily through its
PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their subsidiaries in mainland China. Investors in Bilibili’s ADSs or the Class Z ordinary shares thus are not purchasing
equity interest in the VIEs in mainland China but instead are purchasing equity interest in a Cayman Islands holding company. If the PRC government
deems that our contractual arrangements with the VIEs do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries,
or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we could be subject to severe
penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. We may not be able to repay the notes and other indebtedness, and our shares may
decline in value or become worthless, if we are unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the VIEs, which contribute to 69.4% of
our revenues in 2023. Bilibili, its PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs, and investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC
government that could affect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial
performance of the VIEs and our company as a group.

       We have been further advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and
application of current or future PRC laws and regulations. Thus, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would agree that our contractual
arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may
be adopted in the future. The PRC government may ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC counsel. If we are found in violation of
any PRC laws or regulations or if the contractual arrangements among our WFOEs, the VIEs and their shareholders are determined as illegal or invalid
by the PRC court, arbitral tribunal or regulatory authorities, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such
violation, including, without limitation:
       •      revoking the business licenses and/or operating licenses of such entities;
       •      imposing fines on us;
       •      confiscating any of our income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations;
       •      discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations;
       •      placing restrictions on our right to collect revenues;
       •      shutting down our servers or blocking our app/websites;
       •      requiring us to restructure the operations in such a way as to compel us to establish a new enterprise, re-apply for the necessary licenses or
              relocate our businesses, staff and assets;
       •      imposing additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply; or
       •      taking other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business.

       The imposition of any of these penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business operations. In addition,
if the imposition of any of these penalties causes us to lose the rights to direct the activities of the Consolidated Affiliated Entities or the right to receive
their economic benefits, we would no longer be able to consolidate their financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which would have a material
adverse effect on our operations and result in the value of the securities diminishing substantially. Our shares may decline in value if we are unable to
assert our contractual control rights over the assets of our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs that conduct all or substantially all of our operations. Bilibili,
its PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs and investors of Bilibili face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC government that could affect the
enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance of the VIEs and our
company as a group.

                                                                               47

       Although we believe we, our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs comply with current PRC laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC
government would agree that our contractual arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing
policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. The PRC government has broad discretion in determining rectifiable or
punitive measures for non-compliance with or violations of PRC laws and regulations. If the PRC government determines that we or the VIEs do not
comply with applicable law, it could revoke the VIEs’ business and operating licenses, require the VIEs to discontinue or restrict the VIEs’ operations,
restrict the VIEs’ right to collect revenues, block the VIEs’ websites, require the VIEs to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or
requirements with which the VIEs may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on the VIEs’ business operations or on their customers, or take other
regulatory or enforcement actions against the VIEs that could be harmful to their business. Any of these or similar occurrences could significantly
disrupt our or the VIEs’ business operations or restrict the VIEs from conducting a substantial portion of their business operations, which could
materially and adversely affect the VIEs’ business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these occurrences results in our inability to
direct the activities of any of the VIEs that most significantly impact its economic performance, and/or our failure to receive the economic benefits from
any of the VIEs, we may not be able to consolidate these entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.


We rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders for our operations in mainland China, which may not be as effective in
providing operational control as direct ownership.
       Due to PRC restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership of internet and other related businesses in mainland China, we operate our business
in mainland China through the VIEs and their subsidiaries, in which we have no ownership interest. We rely on a series of contractual arrangements with
the VIEs and their shareholders, as applicable, including the powers of attorney, to control and operate business of the Consolidated Affiliated Entities.
These contractual arrangements are intended to provide us with effective control over the Consolidated Affiliated Entities and allow us to obtain
economic benefits from them. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure” for more details about these contractual
arrangements. In particular, our ability to control the Consolidated Affiliated Entities depends on the powers of attorney, pursuant to which our WFOEs
can vote on all matters requiring shareholder approval in the VIEs. We believe these powers of attorney are legally enforceable but may not be as
effective as direct equity ownership.

       Although we have been advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, that except as disclosed in this annual report, each of the contracts
among our WFOEs, the VIEs and their shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable under existing PRC laws and regulations, these contractual
arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the VIEs and their subsidiaries as direct ownership. If the VIEs or their shareholders fail
to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may incur substantial costs and expend substantial resources to enforce
our rights. These contractual arrangements are governed by and interpreted in accordance with PRC law, and disputes arising from these contractual
arrangements will be resolved through arbitration in mainland China. However, the legal system in mainland China, particularly as it relates to
arbitration proceedings, is not as developed as the legal system in many other jurisdictions, such as the United States. See “—Risks Related to Doing
Business in China—Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you
and us.” There are very few precedents and little official guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a VIE should be interpreted or
enforced under PRC law. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of arbitration should legal action become necessary.
These uncertainties could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In addition, arbitration awards are final and can only be enforced in
PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which could cause additional expenses and delays. In the event we are unable to enforce
these contractual arrangements or we experience significant delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may
not be able to exert effective control over the VIEs and may lose control over the assets owned by the VIEs. As a result, we may be unable to
consolidate the financial results of such entities in our consolidated financial statements, our ability to conduct our business and repay our indebtedness
may be negatively affected, and our operations could be severely disrupted, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

                                                                            48

We may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by the VIEs and their subsidiaries that are important to our business if the VIEs and their
subsidiaries declare bankruptcy or become subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.
      The VIEs hold certain licenses that are important to our operations, including the Value-added Telecommunication Business Licenses, a License
for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, Online Culture Operating Permits and License for Production and Operation of Radio and
Television Programs. Under our contractual arrangements, the shareholders of the VIEs may not voluntarily liquidate the VIEs or approve them to sell,
transfer, mortgage or dispose of their assets or legal or beneficial interests exceeding certain threshold in the business in any manner without our prior
consent. However, in the event that the shareholders breach this obligation and voluntarily liquidate the VIEs, or the VIEs declare bankruptcy, or all or
part of their assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our operations, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the VIEs or their subsidiaries undergo a
voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, their shareholders or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of its assets,
hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Contractual arrangements we have entered into with the VIEs may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. A finding that we owe
additional taxes could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment.
       Pursuant to applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by
PRC tax authorities. We may be subject to adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements among our
WFOE, the VIEs and their shareholders are not on an arm’s-length basis and therefore constitute favorable transfer pricing. As a result, the PRC tax
authorities could require that the VIEs adjust their taxable income upward for PRC tax purposes. Such an adjustment could increase the VIEs’ tax
expenses without reducing the tax expenses of our WFOE, subject the VIEs to late payment fees and other penalties for under-payment of taxes, and
result in the loss of any preferential tax treatment our WFOE may have. As a result, our consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected.


If the chops of our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries, are not kept safely, are stolen or are used by unauthorized persons or for
unauthorized purposes, the corporate governance of these entities could be severely and adversely compromised.
      In mainland China, a company chop or seal serves as the legal representation of the company towards third parties even when unaccompanied by a
signature. Each legally registered company in mainland China is required to maintain a company chop, which must be registered with the local Public
Security Bureau. In addition to this mandatory company chop, companies may have several other chops which can be used for specific purposes. The
chops of our PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs and their subsidiaries are generally held securely by personnel we designated or approved in accordance with
our internal control procedures. To the extent those chops are not kept safe, are stolen or are used by unauthorized persons or for unauthorized purposes,
the corporate governance of these entities could be severely and adversely compromised and those corporate entities may be bound to abide by the terms
of any documents so chopped, even if they were chopped by an individual who lacked the requisite power and authority to do so.


The shareholders of the VIEs may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business.
       The shareholders of the VIEs include Rui Chen, Ni Li and Yi Xu, who are also Bilibili’s shareholders, and, in some cases are Bilibili’s directors or
officers. Conflicts of interest may arise between the roles of them as shareholders, directors or officers of Bilibili and as shareholders of the VIEs. For
individuals who are also Bilibili’s directors and officers, we rely on them to abide by the laws of the Cayman Islands, which provide that directors and
officers owe a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and in the best interest of Bilibili and not to use their positions for personal gain. The shareholders of
the VIEs have executed powers of attorney to appoint our WFOEs or a person designated by our WFOEs to vote on their behalf and exercise voting
rights as shareholders of the VIEs. We cannot assure you that when conflicts arise, these shareholders will act in the best interest of Bilibili or that
conflicts will be resolved in our favor. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and these shareholders, we would have to
rely on legal proceedings, which may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. There is also substantial uncertainty as to the
outcome of any such legal proceedings.

                                                                             49

We may rely on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC
subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and to pay dividends to our
shareholders and ADS holders.
       Bilibili is a holding company, and we may rely on dividends to be paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements, including
the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to the holders of the ADSs and our ordinary shares and service any debt we may incur.
If our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or
make other distributions to us.

      Under PRC laws and regulations, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in mainland China, such as Hode Shanghai, may pay dividends only out of its
accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is
required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years’ accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory
reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability
to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.


Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to how the Foreign Investment Law may impact the viability of our current corporate structure and
operations.
        The National People’s Congress approved the PRC Foreign Investment Law on March 15, 2019, effective from January 1, 2020, and the State
Council approved the Regulation on Implementing the PRC Foreign Investment Law on December 26, 2019, effective from January 1, 2020. The
Supreme People’s Court of mainland China issued a judicial interpretation on the Foreign Investment Law, in December 2019, effective from January 1,
2020, to ensure fair and efficient implementation of the Foreign Investment Law. The judicial interpretation clarifies the issues regarding the validity of
the investment contract violating the restrictive or prohibitive requirements in the negative list. According to the judicial interpretation, courts in
mainland China shall not, among other things, support contracted parties to claim foreign investment contracts in sectors not on the Special
Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2021 Version), most recently jointly promulgated by the Ministry of
Commerce of the PRC and the National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC, or the NDRC, on December 27, 2021 and became effective
on January 1, 2022, or the Negative List (2021), as void because the contracts have not been approved or registered by administrative authorities.
However, since PRC judicial and administrative authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms,
it is difficult to predict the outcome of a judicial or administrative proceeding, and such unpredictability towards our contractual rights could adversely
affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations. The Foreign Investment Law and its implementation regulations embody an
expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative
efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments.

      The Foreign Investment Law removes all references to the terms of “de facto control” or “contractual control” as defined in the draft published in
2015 by the Ministry of Commerce. However, the Foreign Investment Law has a catch-all provision under the definition of “foreign investment” which
includes investments made by foreign investors in mainland China through means stipulated in laws or administrative regulations or other methods
prescribed by the State Council. Therefore, the State Council may in the future promulgate laws and regulations that deem investments made by foreign
investors through contractual arrangements as “foreign investment,” and our contractual arrangements may be subject to and be deemed to violate the
market entry requirements in mainland China. The VIE structure has been adopted by many PRC-based companies, including us, to obtain necessary
licenses and permits in the industries that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in mainland China. See “Item 4. Information on the
Company—C. Organizational Structure” for more details about these contractual arrangements.

                                                                            50
Table of Contents

       In addition, the Foreign Investment Law further specifies that foreign investments shall be conducted in line with the “negative list” to be issued
or approved to be issued by the State Council. The commercial internet information service, internet audio-visual program services, online cultural
activities (except for music), the radio and television program production and operation business, and the production of audio-visual products and/or
electronic publications that we conduct through the Consolidated Affiliated Entities are subject to foreign investment restrictions set forth in the
Negative List (2021). It is uncertain whether the industry of commercial internet information service, internet audio-visual program services, online
culture activities (except for music), the radio and television program production and operation business, and the production of audio-visual products
and/or electronic publications, in which the VIEs operate, will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions under the then updated
“negative list” to be issued. If the then updated “negative list” requires companies with existing VIE structure like us to take further actions, we will face
uncertainties as to whether any clearance from the relevant governmental authorities can be timely obtained, or at all.


Divestitures of businesses and assets may have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
       We may engage partial or complete divestitures or other disposal transactions in connection with certain of our businesses and assets in the future,
particularly ones that are not closely related to our core focus areas or might require excessive resources or financial capital, to help our company meet
its objectives. These decisions are largely based on our management’s assessment of the business models and likelihood of success of these businesses.
However, our judgment could be inaccurate, and we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits from these transactions. Our financial
results could be adversely affected by the impact from the loss of earnings and corporate overhead contribution/allocation associated with divested
businesses.

      Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through guarantees, indemnities or other financial
obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future
financial results. We may also be exposed to negative publicity as a result of the potential misconception that the divested business is still part of our
consolidated group. On the other hand, we cannot assure you that the divesting business would not pursue opportunities to provide services to our
competitors or other opportunities that would conflict with our interests. If any conflicts of interest that may arise between the divesting business and us
cannot be resolved in our favor, our business, financial condition, results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

       Furthermore, reducing or eliminating our ownership interests in these businesses might negatively affect our operations, prospects, or long-term
value. We may lose access to resources or know-how that would have been useful in the development of our own business. Our ability to diversify or
expand our existing businesses or to move into new areas of business may be reduced, and we may have to modify our business strategy to focus more
exclusively on areas of business where we already possess the necessary expertise. We may sell our interests too early, and thus forego gains that we
otherwise would have received had we not sold. Selecting businesses to dispose of or spin off, finding buyers for them (or the equity interests in them to
be sold) and negotiating prices for what may be relatively illiquid ownership interests with no easily ascertainable fair market value will also require
significant attention from our management and may divert resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our
business operations.


Risks Related to Doing Business in China
Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us.
      The PRC legal system is based on written statutes and court decisions have limited precedential value. The PRC legal system is evolving rapidly,
and the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules may contain inconsistencies and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves
uncertainties.

       From time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC judicial and
administrative authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to predict
the outcome of a judicial or administrative proceeding than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based, in part, on
government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published in a timely manner, or at all, but which may have retroactive effect. As a result,
we may not always be aware of any potential violation of these policies and rules. Such unpredictability towards our contractual, property (including
intellectual property) and procedural rights could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.

                                                                             51

The PRC government’s significant oversight over our business operation could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value
of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs.
      We conduct our business primarily in mainland China. Our operations in mainland China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. PRC
government has significant oversight over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our operations as the government deems
appropriate to advance regulatory and societal goals and policy positions. The PRC government has published new policies that significantly affected
certain industries and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies that directly or indirectly affect our
industry or require us to seek additional permission to continue our operations, which could result in a material adverse change in our operation and/or
the value of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs.


The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct
inspections of the auditor in the past had deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections.
       Our auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor of
companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which
the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. The auditor is located in mainland China, a
jurisdiction where the PCAOB was historically unable to conduct inspections and investigations completely before 2022. As a result, we and investors
in the ADSs were deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China in the
past had made it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm’s audit procedures or quality control
procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that
vacated its December 16, 2021 determination and removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or
investigate completely registered public accounting firms. However, if the PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect
and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, and we use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these
jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the SEC, we and investors in our ADSs would be deprived of the benefits of
such PCAOB inspections again, which could cause investors and potential investors in the ADSs to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported
financial information and the quality of our financial statements.


Our ADSs may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, in the
future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the ADSs, or the threat of their being
delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.
      Pursuant to the HFCAA, if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been
subject to inspections by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, the SEC will prohibit our shares or ADSs from being traded on a national securities
exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States.

       On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate
completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, and our auditor was subject to that determination. In
May 2022, the SEC conclusively listed us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of our annual report on Form 20-F
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of
jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. As of the date of this annual report, the PCAOB
has not issued any new determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in any
jurisdiction. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA after we file this annual report on
Form 20-F.

                                                                             52

       Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among
other jurisdictions. If the PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in
mainland China and Hong Kong and we use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial
statements filed with the SEC, we would be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 20-F for the
relevant fiscal year. In accordance with the HFCAA, our securities would be prohibited from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter trading market in the United States if we are identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive years in the future.
Although our Class Z ordinary shares have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the ADSs and the Class Z ordinary shares are fully
fungible, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be sustained or that
the ADSs can be converted and traded with sufficient market recognition and liquidity, if our shares and ADSs are prohibited from trading in the United
States. A prohibition of being able to trade in the United States would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our ADSs when you wish to
do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our ADSs. Also, such a prohibition would
significantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, and prospects.


The approval of, or report and filings with the CSRC or other PRC government authorities may be required in connection with our offshore
offerings under PRC law, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such filing
and report process.
      The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory
agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic
companies and controlled by PRC persons or entities to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s
securities on an overseas stock exchange. The interpretation and application of the regulations remain unclear, and our offshore offerings may ultimately
require approval of the CSRC. If the CSRC approval is required, it is uncertain whether we can or how long it will take us to obtain the approval and,
even if we obtain such CSRC approval, the approval could be rescinded. Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining the CSRC approval for any of our
offshore offerings, or a rescission of such approval if obtained by us, would subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory
authorities, which could include fines and penalties on our operations in mainland China, restrictions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends
outside of mainland China, and other forms of sanctions that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

       On July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities issued Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance
with the Law. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas
listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal
with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies.

       On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies
and five supporting guidelines, effective March 31, 2023. According to these measures, mainland China companies that directly or indirectly offer or list
their securities in an overseas market are required to file with the CSRC. An overseas listed company must also submit the filing with respect to its
follow-on offerings, issuance of convertible corporate bonds and exchangeable bonds, and other equivalent offering activities, within a specific time
frame requested under these measures. An overseas listed company is also required to report material events to the CSRC within three working days
after the occurrence and announcement of certain events, including, among other things, the change of control, investigation or penalties imposed by
relevant authorities, the conversion of listing status or the transfer of listing board. Failure to comply with these filing or reporting requirements may
result in fines and other penalties on the companies, the controlling shareholder and other responsible persons. For more details, see “Item 4.
Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to M&A and Overseas Listings.”

                                                                             53

      On February 17, 2023, the CSRC held a press conference for the release of the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and
Listing by Domestic Companies and issued the Notice on Administration for the Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies,
which clarifies that the domestic companies that have already been listed overseas before March 31, 2023 shall be deemed as the existing applicants who
are not required to complete the filing procedures immediately but shall be required to file with the CSRC when subsequent matters such as refinancing
are involved. Furthermore, for the overseas listing of companies with VIE contractual arrangements, the CSRC will solicit opinions from relevant
regulatory authorities and complete the filing of the overseas listing of companies with these domestic companies which duly meet their compliance
requirements and support their development and growth by enabling them to utilize both markets and their resources. Nevertheless, it does not specify
what qualify as a compliant VIE structure and what relevant domestic laws and regulations are required to be complied with.

      If we fail to file with the CSRC in a timely manner or at all, for any future offering (including, among others, follow-on offerings, issuance of
convertible corporate bonds and exchangeable bonds, and other equivalent offering activities) pursuant to these measures due to our contractual
arrangements, our ability to raise or utilize funds could be materially and adversely affected, and we may even need to unwind our contractual
arrangements or restructure our business operations to rectify the failure to complete the filings. There remain substantial uncertainties as to the
interpretation, application, and enforcement of these measures and how they will affect our operations and our future financing.

      On February 24, 2023, the CSRC and other relevant government authorities promulgated the Provision on Confidentiality of Overseas Securities
Issuance and Listing which became effective on March 31, 2023, according to which, where a domestic enterprise provides or publicly discloses to the
relevant securities companies, securities service institutions, overseas regulatory authorities and other entities and individuals, or provides or publicly
discloses through its overseas listing subjects, documents and materials involving state secrets and working secrets of state organs, it shall report the
same to the competent department with the examination and approval authority for approval in accordance with the law, and submit the same to the
secrecy administration department of the same level for filing.

       On December 27, 2021, the NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued the Negative List (2021), which became effective on January 1,
2022. Pursuant to the Negative List (2021), if a domestic company engaging in the prohibited business stipulated in the Negative List (2021) seeks an
overseas offering and listing, it shall obtain the approval from the competent governmental authorities. Besides, the foreign investors of the company
shall not be involved in the company’s operation and management, and their shareholding percentages shall be subject, mutatis mutandis, to the relevant
regulations on the domestic securities investments by foreign investors. At a press conference held on January 18, 2022, the NDRC clarified that the
requirement as mentioned above would only apply to domestic company’s direct overseas offerings; as for the domestic company to list overseas
indirectly, the CSRC is seeking public comments on the relevant regulations. As the Negative List (2021) is relatively new, there remain substantial
uncertainties as to the interpretation and implementation of these new requirements, and it is unclear as to whether and to what extent listed companies
like us will be subject to these new requirements. If we are required to comply with these requirements and fail to do so on a timely basis, if at all, our
business operation, financial conditions and business prospect may be adversely and materially affected.

       In addition, we cannot assure you that any new rules or regulations promulgated in the future will not impose additional requirements on us. If it is
determined in the future that approval and filing from the CSRC or other regulatory authorities or other procedures, including the cybersecurity review
under the enacted versions of the draft measures, regulations and provisions described above, are required for our offshore offerings, it is uncertain
whether we can or how long it will take us to obtain such approval or complete such filing procedures and any such approval or filing could be
rescinded or rejected. Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining such approval or completing such filing procedures for our offshore offerings, or a
rescission of any such approval or filing if obtained by us, would subject us to sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities for failure to
seek CSRC approval or filing or other government authorization for our offshore offerings. These regulatory authorities may impose fines and penalties
on our operations in mainland China, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of mainland China, limit our operating privileges in mainland China,
delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our offshore offerings into mainland China or take other actions that could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our listed securities. The CSRC or
other PRC regulatory authorities also may take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt our offshore offerings before settlement and
delivery of the shares offered. Consequently, if investors engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to settlement and
delivery, they do so at the risk that settlement and delivery may not occur. In addition, if the CSRC or other regulatory authorities later promulgate new
rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals or accomplish the required filing or other regulatory procedures for our prior offshore
offerings, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any
uncertainties or negative publicity regarding such approval requirement could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
condition, reputation, and the trading price of our listed securities.

                                                                             54

We face uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy
Sector and other anti-monopoly and competition laws and how it may impact our business operations.
       The PRC anti-monopoly enforcement agencies have strengthened enforcement under the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law in recent years. In February
2021, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector was promulgated by the Anti-monopoly Commission of the PRC State
Council. The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector is consistent with the Anti-Monopoly Law of the PRC and prohibits
monopoly agreements, abuse of dominant position and concentration of undertakings that may have the effect of eliminating or restricting competitions
in the field of platform economy. More specifically, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector outlines certain practices
that may, if without justifiable reasons, constitute abuse of dominant position, including, without limitation, tailored pricing using big data and analytics,
actions or arrangements seen as exclusivity arrangements, using technology means to block competitors’ interface, using bundled services to sell
services or products, and compulsory collection of user data. Besides, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector
expressly states that concentration involving VIE will also be subject to antitrust filing requirements. On August 17, 2021, the SAMR issued the
Provisions on Preventing Unfair Online Competition (Draft for Comments), which detailed the implementation of the PRC Unfair Competition Law,
including specifying certain online unfair competition behaviors that should be prohibited. As of the date of this annual report, Provisions on Preventing
Unfair Online Competition (Draft for Comments) have not been formally adopted, and due to the lack of further clarification, there are still uncertainties
regarding the interpretation and implementation of the provisions. Since the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector are
relatively new and the Provisions on Preventing Unfair Online Competition (Draft for Comments) have not been formally adopted, uncertainties still
exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. Although we do not believe we engage in any foregoing situations which would cause material
adverse effect on our financial and business conditions, we cannot assure you that our business operations will comply with such regulation in all
respects, and any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such regulation may result in governmental investigations, fines and/or other
sanctions on us.

      In April 2021, the SAMR, together with certain other PRC government authorities convened an administrative guidance meeting, focusing on
unfair competition acts in community group buying, self-inspection and rectification by major internet companies of possible violations of anti-
monopoly, anti-unfair competition, tax and other related laws and regulations, and requesting such companies to comply with relevant laws and
regulations strictly and be subject to public supervision. In addition, many internet companies, including over 30 companies which attended such
administrative guidance meeting, are required to conduct a comprehensive self-inspection and make necessary rectification accordingly. The SAMR
stated that it will organize and conduct inspections on the companies’ rectification results. If a company is found to conduct illegal activities, more
severe penalties are expected to be imposed in accordance with the laws.

      On June 24, 2022, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted the amendment on Anti-Monopoly Law, which introduced
a “safe harbor” for anti-competitive agreements that have a market share lower than a specific threshold to be set by the SAMR, granted the SAMR the
power to suspend the review period in merger investigations under specified circumstances, allowed public prosecutors to bring a civil public interest
lawsuit based on monopolistic behaviors, and significantly increased the penalties for violation of anti-monopoly law. This amendment emphasized on
the enforcement of anti-monopoly laws in the internet, finance and other key industries.

                                                                             55

       The strengthened enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law could result in investigations on our acquisition transactions conducted in the past and
make our acquisition transactions in the future more difficult due to the prior filing requirement. If a business operator carries out a concentration in
violation of the Anti-Monopoly Law, the relevant authority may order the business operator to terminate the concentration, dispose of the shares or
assets or transfer the business within a specified time limit, or take other measures to restore the pre-concentration status, and impose a fine of up to 10%
of the preceding year’s sales volume where such concentration has or may have the effect of excluding or restricting competition, or a fine of up to
RMB5,000,000 where such concentration does not have the effect of excluding or restricting competition. The PRC anti-monopoly laws may increase
our compliance burden, particularly in the context of relevant PRC authorities strengthening supervision and enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law
against internet platforms. If the PRC regulatory authorities identify any of our activities as monopolistic under the Anti-Monopoly Law or the Anti-
Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector, or identify us holding a dominant market position or of abusing such dominant
position, we may be subject to investigations and administrative penalties, such as termination of monopolistic act and confiscation of illegal gains.
There are significant uncertainties associated with the evolving legislative activities and varied local implementation practices of anti-monopoly and
competition laws and regulations in mainland China. Any non-compliance or associated inquiries, investigations and other governmental actions may
divert significant management time and attention and our financial resources, lead to negative publicity, liabilities or administrative penalties, therefore
materially and adversely affect our financial conditions, operations and business prospects. If we are required to take any rectifying or remedial
measures or are subject to any penalties, our reputation and business operations may be materially and adversely affected.


Regulation and censorship of information disseminated over the mobile and internet in mainland China may adversely affect our business and
subject us to liability for content posted on our platform.
       Internet companies in mainland China are subject to a variety of existing and new rules, regulations, policies, and license and permit requirements
on the distribution of information over the mobile and internet. Under these rules and regulations, content service providers are prohibited from posting
or displaying over the mobile or internet content that, among others, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China or the
public interest, is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory, or may be deemed by relevant government authorities as “socially destabilizing” or
leaking “state secrets” of China. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations
Related to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection.” In connection with enforcing these rules, regulations, policies and requirements,
relevant government authorities may suspend services by, or revoke licenses of, any internet or mobile content service provider that is deemed to
provide illicit content online or on mobile devices, and such activities may be intensified in connection with any ongoing government campaigns to
eliminate prohibited content online. For example, in recent years, the National Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal Publications, the Cyberspace
Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the Ministry of Public Security
jointly have been launching a series of “Clean Up the Internet” campaigns. These campaigns aim to eliminate pornographic information and content in
the internet information services industry by, among other things, holding liable individuals and corporate entities that facilitate the distribution of
pornographic information and content. During the campaigns, relevant government authorities have shut down websites, removed links and closed
accounts. Certain major public internet companies voluntarily initiated self-investigations to filter and remove content from their websites and cloud
servers. In January 2019, China Netcasting Services Association issued the Regulations on Administration of Network Short Video Platforms and
Censoring Criteria for Network Short Video Content, the latter of which was further amended in December 2021, to tighten the censorship on short
video content. The regulatory authorities carried out a series of law enforcement actions against violation of personal information protection from
January to December 2019. On January 23, 2019, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, and the SAMR, jointly issued the Notice on Special Governance of Illegal Collection and Use of Personal
Information via Apps, which restates the requirement of legal collection and use of personal information, encourages APP operators to conduct security
certifications, and encourages search engines and app stores to clearly mark and recommend those certified apps. At the same time, they announced a
one-year special crackdown on the illegal collection and misuse of personal information by apps. On July 22, 2020, the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology issued the Notice on Carrying out Special Rectification Actions in Depth against the Infringement on Users’ Rights and
Interests by Apps to urge app service providers, among others, to strengthen the protection of users’ personal information in relation to the download
and usage of apps. On March 12, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of
Public Security and the SAMR jointly issued the Necessary Personal Information Range Provisions of Common Types of Apps to further provide
guidance over personal information security and privacy protection. As a result, a number of mobile apps were condemned publicly for their
non-compliance with personal information protection policies, including, among other non-compliance actions, the failure to publish rules on the
collection and improper use of users’ personal information, the failure to provide channels for users to access and revise their information, the failure to
provide functions for users to cancel accounts, the unauthorized collection of personal information, the unreasonable requests for access, and the
unauthorized sharing of information with third parties. For more information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—
Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business
Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection.”

                                                                             56

      We endeavor to eliminate illicit content from our platform. We have made substantial investments in resources to monitor content that users post
on our platform and the way in which our users engage with each other through our platform. In the past, we have terminated certain user accounts in
order to eliminate spam, fictitious accounts and indecent content from our platform. We use a variety of methods to ensure our platform remains a
healthy and positive experience for our users, including a designated content management team and our own data analytics software. Although we
employ these methods to filter our users and content posted by our users, we cannot be sure that our internal content control efforts will be sufficient to
remove all content that may be viewed as indecent or otherwise non-compliant with PRC law and regulations. Government standards and interpretations
as to what constitutes illicit online content or behavior are subject to interpretation and may change.

       We have paid fines in connection with content posted on our platform, and government standards and interpretations may change in a manner that
could render our current monitoring efforts insufficient. The PRC government has wide discretion in regulating online activities and, irrespective of our
efforts to control the content on our platform, government campaigns and other actions to reduce illicit content and activities could subject us to negative
press or regulatory challenges and sanctions, including imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of our licenses to operate in mainland China or a
ban of our platform, including closure of one or more parts of or our entire business. Further, our senior management could be held criminally liable if
we are deemed to be profiting from illicit content on our platform. Although our operations have not been materially adversely affected by government
campaigns or any other regulatory actions in the past, we cannot assure you that our business and operations will be immune from government actions
or sanctions in the future. If government actions or sanctions are brought against us, or if there are widespread rumors that government actions or
sanctions have been brought against us, our reputation could be harmed, we may lose users and other customers, our revenues and results of operation
may be materially and adversely affected and the value of our securities could be dramatically reduced.

       In March 2018, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television issued the Notice on Further Regulating the Order of
Online Audio-Visual Programs to further regulate the transmission of internet audio-visual programs. Due to the lack of clarification and detailed
implementation rules, it is unclear to us whether and how this notice would be applicable to the content posted on our platform by our users. In
November 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the National Radio and Television Administration and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism,
jointly issued the Notice on Promulgation of the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Information Services, which required the providers
of internet audio-visual information services to have sufficient capacities to deal with cyber threats, prevent internet illegal and criminal activities, and
defend the integrity, safety and availability of online data. We have conducted a review of the content that may be implicated on our platform and
believe our current content monitoring measures in place are adequate. However, given the uncertainty in the interpretation and implementation of this
notice, we may be required to subsequently implement further content monitoring measures, which could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding this notice, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business
Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”


Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on overall economic growth in
China, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
      A substantial majority of our revenues is sourced from China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are
influenced by economic, political and legal developments in China. Economic reforms begun in the late 1970s have resulted in significant economic
growth. However, any economic reform policies or measures in China may from time to time be modified or revised. China’s economy differs from the
economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development,
growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past years,
growth has been uneven across different regions and among different economic sectors.

                                                                             57
Table of Contents

      The PRC government exercises significant oversight over China’s economic growth through strategically allocating resources, controlling the
payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or
companies. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in the past decade, that growth may not continue, as evidenced by the slowing of the
growth of the PRC economy in the recent years. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the PRC government or in the
laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect
our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position.


Currently there is no law or regulation specifically governing virtual asset property rights and therefore it is not clear what liabilities, if any, online
game operators may have for virtual assets.
       While playing online games or participating on platform activities, our users acquire and accumulate some virtual assets, such as special
equipment and other accessories. Such virtual assets can be important to online game players. In practice, virtual assets can be lost for various reasons,
often through unauthorized use of the game account of one user by other users and occasionally through data loss caused by a delay of network service,
a network crash or hacking activities. On May 28, 2020, the PRC Civil Code was enacted, effective on January 1, 2021, pursuant to which, ownership of
data and virtual assets are civil rights protected by laws. However, there is currently no further PRC law or regulation specifically governing virtual asset
property rights. As a result, there is uncertainty as to who the legal owner of virtual assets is, whether and how the ownership of virtual assets is
protected by law, and whether an operator of online games such as us would have any liability to game players or other interested parties (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) for loss of such virtual assets. Based on several PRC court judgments, courts generally required the online game operators to
provide well-developed security systems to protect virtual assets owned by players and some courts required game operators to return the virtual items
or found game operators liable for the loss and damage incurred therefrom if the online game operators are found to be in default or violate players’
rights. In case of a loss of virtual assets, we may be sued by our game players or users and held liable for damages, which may negatively affect our
reputation and business, financial condition and results of operations.


Restrictions on virtual currency may adversely affect our online game revenues.
       Our revenues from mobile games are collected through the online sale of in-game items, which are considered to be the “virtual currency” as such
term is defined in the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Virtual Currency of Online Games, which was jointly issued by the Ministry of Culture
of the PRC the predecessor of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the Ministry of Commerce in 2009. PRC laws and regulations, including this
notice, have provided various restrictions on virtual currency and imposed various requirements and obligations on online game operators with respect
to the virtual currency used in their games, including that (i) any entity engaged in the services relating to the issuance or trading of virtual currencies for
online games shall comply with the conditions relevant to the establishment of an internet culture entity for business purpose and file an application with
the provincial administrative department of culture at its locality for preliminary examination and then with the Ministry of Culture of the PRC for
approval; (ii) the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators and the amount purchased by individual users in mainland China is
subject to limits, and online game operators are required to report the total amount of their issued virtual currency on a quarterly basis and are prohibited
from issuing disproportionate amounts of virtual currency in order to generate revenues; (iii) virtual currency may only be provided to users in exchange
for payment in legal currency and may only be used to pay for virtual goods and services of the issuer of the currency, and online game operators are
required to keep transaction data records for no less than 180 days; (iv) online game operators are prohibited from providing lucky draws or lotteries that
are conducted on the condition that participants contribute cash or virtual currency in exchange for game props or virtual currencies; (v) online game
operators are prohibited from providing virtual currency trading services to minors; and (vi) companies involved with virtual currency in mainland
China must be either issuers or trading platforms, and may not operate simultaneously both as issuers and as trading platforms. We must tailor our
business model carefully, including designing and operating our databases to maintain user information for the minimum required period, in order to
comply with the current PRC laws and regulations, including the foregoing notices, in a manner that in many cases can be expected to result in an
adverse impact on our online game revenues.

                                                                              58

If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to
us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.
        Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a “de facto
management body” within the PRC is considered a PRC resident enterprise. The implementation rules define the term “de facto management body” as
the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management of the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an
enterprise. In 2009, the State Tax Administration issued the Circular Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated
Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies which was most recently amended in December 2017, or the
Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is
incorporated offshore is located in mainland China. The State Tax Administration issued Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises
Income Tax Regulation, or the Bulletin 45, which took effect on September 1, 2011 and was last amended on June 15, 2018, to provide more guidance
on the implementation of Circular 82 and clarify the reporting and filing obligations of Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated resident enterprises.
Bulletin 45 also provides procedures and administrative details for the determination of resident status and administration of post-determination matters.
Although Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC
individuals or foreigners like us, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Tax Administration’s general position on how the “de facto
management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore
incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident enterprise by virtue of having
its “de facto management body” in mainland China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following
conditions are met: (i) senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function have their presence mainly in the
PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial matters (such as loan, financing, and financial risk management) and human resource matters
(such as appointment, dismissal and remuneration) are made or are subject to determination or approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;
(iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in
the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.

       We believe that none of our entities outside of mainland China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status
of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto
management body.” If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we will be subject to
the enterprise income tax on our global income at the rate of 25% and we will be required to comply with PRC enterprise income tax reporting
obligations. In addition, we may be required to withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident
enterprises, including the holders of the ADSs. In addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) may be subject to PRC tax
at a rate of 10% on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within the
PRC. Furthermore, if PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, dividends paid to our
non-PRC individual shareholders (including the ADS holders) and any gain realized on the transfer of the ADSs or ordinary shares by such holders may
be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20% (which, in the case of dividends, may be withheld at source by us), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC
sources. These rates may be reduced by applicable tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a
PRC resident enterprise, but it is unclear whether our non-PRC shareholders would be able to obtain the benefits of any tax treaties between their
country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your
investment in our securities.

                                                                           59

There are significant uncertainties under the Enterprise Income Tax Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiaries, and
dividends payable by our PRC subsidiaries to our offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain treaty benefits.
      Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, the profits of a foreign-invested enterprise generated through operations,
which are distributed to its immediate holding company outside mainland China, will be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%. Pursuant to a special
arrangement between Hong Kong and mainland China, such rate may be reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the
equity interest in the PRC company. Our current PRC subsidiaries are wholly owned by our Hong Kong subsidiaries, such as Hode HK. Accordingly,
Hode HK may qualify for a 5% tax rate in respect of distributions from its PRC subsidiaries. Under the Notice of the State Taxation Administration on
Issues regarding the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated in 2009, the taxpayer needs to satisfy certain conditions to
enjoy the benefits under a tax treaty. These conditions include, but are not limited to: (i) the taxpayer must be the beneficial owner of the relevant
dividends, and (ii) the corporate shareholder to receive dividends from the PRC subsidiaries must have met the direct ownership thresholds during the
12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. Further, the State Tax Administration promulgated the Announcement of the Certain
Issues with Respect to the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties in 2018, which sets forth certain detailed factors in determining “beneficial owner” status,
and specifically, if an applicant’s business activities do not constitute substantive business activities, the applicant will not qualify as a “beneficial
owner.”

       Entitlement to a lower tax rate on dividends according to tax treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of
other countries or regions is subject to the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties promulgated
by the State Tax Administration on October 14, 2019 and became effective from January 1, 2020, which provides that non-resident enterprises are not
required to obtain pre-approval from the relevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax. Instead, non-resident enterprises and their
withholding agents may, by self-assessment and on confirmation that the prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met, directly apply the
reduced withholding tax rate, collect and retain relevant materials for reference in accordance with these treaties and accept supervision and
management from the tax authorities. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be entitled to any preferential withholding tax rate under tax treaties
for dividends received from our PRC subsidiaries.


We face uncertainty with respect to the indirect transfer of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.
     We face uncertainties regarding the reporting on and consequences of previous private equity financing transactions involving the transfer and
exchange of shares in Bilibili by non-resident investors.

      In February 2015, the State Tax Administration issued the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by
Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or STA Bulletin 7, as amended in 2017. Pursuant to this bulletin, an “indirect transfer” of assets, including equity
interests in a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if
such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income
tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. According to STA Bulletin 7, “PRC taxable
assets” include assets attributed to an establishment in mainland China, immovable properties located in mainland China, and equity investments in PRC
resident enterprises, in respect of which gains from their transfer by a direct holder, being a non-PRC resident enterprise, would be subject to PRC
enterprise income taxes. When determining whether there is a “reasonable commercial purpose” of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into
consideration include: whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the
assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consist of direct or indirect investment in mainland China or if its income mainly derives from mainland
China; whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is
evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure; the duration of existence of the shareholders, the business model and organizational structure of the
offshore enterprise; the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the offshore tax situation of such indirect transfer and
applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In respect of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain is to be
included with the enterprise income tax filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and would consequently be subject to
PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to the immovable properties located in mainland China or to equity
investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise
income tax of 10% would apply, subject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements, and the party who is
obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding obligation. Where the payer fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor is required
to declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to
default interest. STA Bulletin 7 does not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were
acquired from a transaction through a public stock exchange.

                                                                              60
Table of Contents

      There is uncertainty as to the application of STA Bulletin 7. We face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and
future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries or investments.
Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our company is transferor in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding
obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions under STA Bulletin 7. For transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC
resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under STA Bulletin 7. As a result, we may be required to expend
valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these
circulars, or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.


Discontinuation of any of the preferential tax treatments available to us or imposition of any additional taxes could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.
       The Enterprise Income Tax Law imposes a unified 25% enterprise income tax rate on all resident enterprises in mainland China, subject to certain
exceptions. Certain enterprises may enjoy a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% under the Enterprise Income Tax Law if they qualify as a
High and New Technology Enterprise. For example, Hode Information Technology has previously qualified as a High and New Technology Enterprise,
which allowed it to enjoy a 15% preferential enterprise income tax rate for three years from 2023 to 2025. Shanghai Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd.
previously qualified as a High and New Technology Enterprise, which allowed it to enjoy a 15% preferential enterprise income tax rate for three years
from 2021 to 2023, and plans to renew its qualification as a High and New Technology Enterprise in 2024. If Hode Information Technology or Shanghai
Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd. fails to maintain or renew their High and New Technology Enterprise status, their applicable enterprise income tax rate
may be increased to 25%, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


There are uncertainties with respect to value-added tax rates relating to the tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiaries.
       The Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration and the General Administration of Customs promulgated the Notice on Relevant Policies
for Deepening Value-added Tax Reform on March 20, 2019, which provides that the value-added tax rate of 16% in manufacturing and other industries
is reduced to 13%, the value-added tax rate of 10% in transportation and other industries is reduced to 9%, and the value-added tax rate in value-added
telecommunication service and other industries stays at 6% from April 1, 2019. We are subject to value-added tax for goods sold mainly at a rate of 13%
depending on their categories in different periods in 2021, 2022 and 2023. Our advertising revenues (value-added tax included) are subject to culture
business construction fee at a rate of 3% in the first half year of 2019, which was reduced to 1.5% since July 1, 2019, valid until December 31, 2024.
The cultural business construction fees were exempted for the fiscal years of 2020 and 2021 as part of the measures taken by the government to ease the
negative impact from COVID-19 pandemic. We are also subject to surcharges on value-added tax payments in accordance with PRC law. Starting from
September 1, 2021, we are no longer legally required to withhold surcharges on value-added tax withheld for non-trade foreign exchange payments.
However, it is uncertain whether the value-added tax rate will be raised or any of the above-mentioned tax treatments will be altered in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject
to sanctions including corrective orders, imposition of fines and confiscation of illegal gains.


It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within mainland China.
      Shareholder claims or regulatory investigations that are common in the United States (including securities law class actions and fraud claims)
generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in mainland China. For example, in mainland China, there are significant legal and
other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside mainland China. Although the authorities in
mainland China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement
cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the
absence of a mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which
became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator may directly conduct investigations or collect evidence and no entities or individuals
may provide documents or materials in connection with securities activities without proper authorization as stipulated under Article 177. While detailed
interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability of an overseas securities regulator to directly
conduct investigations or collect evidence within mainland China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests. See also “—
Our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests, and the ability to protect their rights through U.S. courts and Hong Kong courts may
be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law” for risks associated with investing in us as a Cayman Islands exempted company.

                                                                           61

China’s M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign investors,
which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in mainland China.
      The M&A Rules, and other newly adopted regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and
requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M&A Rules
require that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC
domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic
security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand.
Moreover, the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, as amended in June 2022 and the
Provisions of the State Council on the Thresholds for Declaring Concentration of Business Operators, as amended in 2024, require that transactions
which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds (meaning during the previous fiscal year, (i) the total global
turnover of all operators participating in the transaction exceeds RMB12 billion and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than
RMB800 million within mainland China, or (ii) the total turnover within mainland China of all the operators participating in the concentration exceeded
RMB4 billion, and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than RMB800 million within mainland China) must be cleared by anti-
monopoly law enforcement agency of the State Council before they can be completed. Where a concentration of business operators does not satisfy the
threshold for declaration as prescribed, but there is evidence proving that the concentration has or may have the effect of eliminating or restricting
competition, the anti-monopoly law enforcement authorities of the State Council may request the business operators to declare the concentration. On
December 14, 2020, the SAMR announced three cases of administrative penalties for the failures of acquirers to make proper concentration declarations
to authorities about their past acquisitions. This is also the first time that the SAMR imposed administrative penalties for illegal concentration
declarations on entities structured in a VIE arrangement.

       In addition, in 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and
Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, also known as Circular 6, which officially established a security review system for mergers
and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Further, the Ministry of Commerce promulgated the Regulations on Implementation of
Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, effective in September 2011, to implement
Circular 6. Under Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having “national defense and security”
concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire the “de facto control” of domestic enterprises with “national security”
concerns. Under the foregoing the Ministry of Commerce regulations, the Ministry of Commerce will focus on the substance and actual impact of the
transaction when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition is subject to security review. If the Ministry of Commerce decides that a specific
merger or acquisition is subject to a security review, it will submit it to the Inter-Ministerial Panel, an authority established under Circular 6 led by the
NDRC, and the Ministry of Commerce under the leadership of the State Council, to carry out security review. The regulations prohibit foreign investors
from bypassing the security review by structuring transactions through trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual
arrangements or offshore transactions. There is no explicit provision or official interpretation stating that the merging or acquisition of a company
engaged in the internet content or mobile games business requires security review, and there is no requirement that acquisitions completed prior to the
promulgation of the Security Review Circular are subject to the Ministry of Commerce review. On December 19, 2020, the NDRC and the Ministry of
Commerce jointly promulgated the Measures on the Security Review of Foreign Investment, effective on January 18, 2021, setting forth provisions
concerning the security review mechanism on foreign investment, including the types of investments subject to review, review scopes and procedures,
among others. The Office of the Working Mechanism of the Security Review of Foreign Investment was established under the NDRC, who leads the
task together with the Ministry of Commerce. Foreign investor or relevant parties in mainland China must declare the security review to this office prior
to the investments in, among other industries, important cultural products and services, important information technology and internet products and
services, important financial services, key technologies and other important fields relating to national security, and obtain control in the target enterprise.
See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Foreign Investment in the PRC.”

                                                                              62

       In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned
regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining
approval from the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. It is unclear whether
our business would be deemed to be in an industry that raises “national defense and security” or “national security” concerns. However, the Ministry of
Commerce or other government agencies may publish explanations in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security
review, in which case our future acquisitions in mainland China, including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements with target
entities, may be closely scrutinized or prohibited.


PRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered
capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us to liability and penalties under PRC law.
       The State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or the SAFE, promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign
Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or the
SAFE Circular 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or
control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update
their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including
change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or
mergers or divisions. According to the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Policies for the Foreign Exchange Administration of Direct
Investment released in February 2015 by SAFE, as amended in December 2019, or SAFE Circular 13, local banks will examine and handle foreign
exchange registration for overseas direct investment, including the initial foreign exchange registration and amendment registration, under SAFE
Circular 37 from June 2015.

      If our shareholders who are PRC residents or entities do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches or local banks, our PRC
subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and we may
be restricted in our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration described
above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.

       Rui Chen, Ni Li and Yi Xu have completed initial SAFE registration prior to our initial public offering in 2018 and will update their registration
filings with SAFE under SAFE Circular 37 when any changes should be registered under SAFE Circular 37. However, we may not at all times be fully
aware or informed of the identities of all our shareholders or beneficial owners that are required to make or update such registrations, and we cannot
compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE registration requirements. As a result, we cannot assure you that all of our shareholders or
beneficial owners who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals
required by, SAFE regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations or our failure to amend the foreign
exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities,
limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and
prospects.

                                                                            63

Failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock ownership plans or share option plans may
subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.
       Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly listed companies due to their
position as director, senior management or employees of the PRC subsidiaries of the overseas companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local
branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. Our directors, executive officers and other employees
who are PRC residents and who have been granted share-based awards could follow SAFE Circular 37 to apply for the foreign exchange registration
before Bilibili became an overseas listed company. In 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration
for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies. Under the notices and other relevant rules and
regulations, PRC residents who participate in stock incentive plan in an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with SAFE or its local
branches and complete certain other procedures. Participants of a stock incentive plan who are PRC residents must retain a qualified PRC agent, which
could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by such PRC subsidiary, to conduct the
SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the stock incentive plan on behalf of its participants. Such participants must also retain an
overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share-based awards, the purchase and sale of corresponding shares or
interests and fund transfers. In addition, the PRC agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any
material change to the stock incentive plan, the PRC agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. Failure of our PRC stock
option holders to complete their SAFE registrations may subject these PRC residents to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to
contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary’s ability to distribute dividends to us, or otherwise materially adversely
affect our business. The State Tax Administration has issued certain circulars concerning equity incentive awards. Under these circulars, our employees
working in mainland China who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Each of our PRC
subsidiaries has obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold
individual income taxes for those employees. If our employees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and
regulations, we may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC governmental authorities.


PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion
may restrict or prevent us from using the proceeds of the offering of equity securities and notes to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs
and their subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.
       Bilibili is an offshore holding company conducting its operations in mainland China through PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their subsidiaries.
Bilibili may make loans to its PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their subsidiaries, or it may make additional capital contributions to its PRC subsidiaries,
establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, or acquire offshore entities with business operations in
mainland China in an offshore transaction.

       Most of these ways are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example, loans we make to our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries to finance
their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of SAFE. If we decide to finance our wholly owned PRC
subsidiaries by means of capital contributions, these capital contributions are subject to the requirement of making necessary filings in the Foreign
Investment Comprehensive Management Information System and registration with other governmental authorities in mainland China. Due to the
restrictions imposed on loans in foreign currencies extended to any PRC domestic companies, we are not likely to make such loans to the Consolidated
Affiliated Entities, which are PRC domestic company. Further, we are not likely to finance the activities of the Consolidated Affiliated Entities by means
of capital contributions due to regulatory restrictions relating to foreign investment in PRC domestic enterprises engaged in internet information
services, online games, online audio-visual program services and related businesses.

                                                                            64
Table of Contents

       SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement
of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, effective June 2015, and last amended on December 30, 2019. According to SAFE
Circular 19, the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company is
regulated such that RMB capital may not be used for the issuance of RMB entrusted loans, the repayment of inter-enterprise loans or the repayment of
banks loans that have been transferred to a third party. Although SAFE Circular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated
registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within mainland China, it also reiterates the principle that RMB
converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its
business scope. Thus, it is unclear whether SAFE will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in mainland China in actual practice. SAFE
promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement
Management Policy of Capital Account, or SAFE Circular 16, effective on June 9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular
19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested
company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to non-associated enterprises. Violations of SAFE
Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to
transfer any foreign currency we hold, including the net proceeds from our equity offering and notes offering and then to our PRC subsidiaries, which
may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in mainland China. On October 23, 2019, SAFE issued Notice of the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the Circular 28. Circular 28
allows non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to use their capital funds to make equity investments in mainland China; provided that such
investments do not violate the Negative List (2021) and the target investment projects are genuine and in compliance with PRC laws. The interpretation
and implementation of Circular 28 in practice are still subject to substantial uncertainties. According to the Circular on Optimizing the Administration of
Foreign Exchange to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business issued by the SAFE on April 10, 2020, eligible enterprises are allowed to
make domestic payments using the income under their capital accounts generated from their capital, foreign debt and overseas listing, without providing
materials evidencing the authenticity in advance; provided that the capital usage is authentic and compliant with the current capital account income
usage management regulations. The concerned bank is required to conduct spot checks in accordance with the relevant requirements.

       In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely
basis, if at all, with respect to future loans we make to our PRC subsidiary or with respect to future capital contributions we make to our PRC subsidiary.
If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we received from our equity offering and notes offering
and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our
ability to fund and expand our business.


Fluctuation in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.
      The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People’s Bank of China. The Renminbi has
fluctuated against the U.S. dollars, at times significantly and unpredictably. The value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollars and other currencies is
affected by changes in China’s political and economic conditions and by China’s foreign exchange policies, among other things. We cannot assure you
that Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollars in the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or
PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between Renminbi and the U.S. dollars in the future.

       A substantial majority of our revenues and costs is denominated in Renminbi. Any significant depreciation of the Renminbi may materially
adversely affect the value of, and any dividends payable on, the ADSs in U.S. dollars. For example, when we convert our U.S. dollars denominated
funds into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollars would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we
would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for
dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollars against the Renminbi would have a negative
effect on the U.S. dollars amount available to us. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to U.S. dollars would
affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollars terms regardless of any underlying change in our business or results of operations.

                                                                             65

        Very limited hedging options are available in mainland China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered
into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging
transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or
at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into
foreign currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment.


Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.
       The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of
currency out of mainland China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, Bilibili, a Cayman
Islands holding company, primarily relies on dividend payments from its PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements it may have.
Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and
service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural
requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC
subsidiaries in mainland China may be used to pay dividends to Bilibili. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities
is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of mainland China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment
of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval or registration to use cash generated from the operations of
our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside mainland China, or to
make other capital expenditure payments outside mainland China in a currency other than Renminbi.

       In light of the flood of capital outflows of mainland China in 2016 due to the weakening Renminbi, the PRC government has imposed more
restrictive foreign exchange policies and stepped up scrutiny of major outbound capital movement including overseas direct investment. More
restrictions and substantial vetting process are put in place by SAFE to regulate cross-border transactions falling under the capital account. If any of our
shareholders regulated by such policies fails to satisfy the applicable overseas direct investment filing or approval requirement timely or at all, it may be
subject to penalties from the relevant PRC authorities. The PRC government may at its discretion further restrict access in the future to foreign
currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our
foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of the ADSs.


Risks Related to Our Listed Securities
The trading prices of our listed securities have been and are likely to continue to be volatile, regardless of our operating performance, which could
result in substantial losses to our investors.
      The trading price of our ADSs has been volatile since our ADSs started to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and could fluctuate widely
due to factors beyond our control. The trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares, likewise, can be volatile for similar or different reasons. This may
happen because of broad market and industry factors, including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with operations
located mainly in mainland China that have listed their securities in the United States and/or Hong Kong, or because of trends in the global economy in
general or the Chinese economy in particular, or because of international geopolitical tensions. In addition to market and industry factors, the prices and
trading volumes for our listed securities may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations, including the following:
       •     variations in our revenues, earnings, cash flow and data related to our user base or user engagement;
       •     announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;
       •     announcements of new product and service offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;

                                                                             66

       •      changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;
       •      detrimental adverse publicity about us, our products and services or our industry;
       •      additions or departures of key personnel;
       •      releases at any time, in some cases without notice, of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares, ADSs or
              other equity related securities;
       •      sales of additional ADSs or other equity-related securities in the public markets, or issuance of ADSs upon conversion of convertible
              senior notes we issued, or the perception of these events; and
       •      actual or potential litigation or regulatory investigations.


Sales or perceived potential sales of our Class Z ordinary shares, ADSs, or other equity or equity-linked securities in the public market could cause
the price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs to decline.
       Sales, either directly or in connection with derivative or other financial arrangements, of our Class Z ordinary shares, ADSs, or other equity or
equity-linked securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may cause the market price of our Class Z ordinary shares
and/or ADSs to decline significantly. All of our Class Z ordinary shares represented by ADSs were freely transferable by persons other than our
affiliates without restriction or additional registration under the U.S. Securities Act. The Class Z ordinary shares held by our affiliates are also available
for sale, subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable under Rule 144 of the U.S. Securities Act, under trading plans adopted pursuant to Rule
10b5-1 or otherwise.

      Furthermore, although all of our directors and executive officers have agreed to a lock-up of their Class Z ordinary shares, any major disposal of
our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs by any of them upon expiration of the relevant lock-up periods (or the perception that these disposals may
occur upon the expiration of the lock-up period) may cause the prevailing market price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs to fall which could
negatively impact our ability to raise equity capital in the future.


We may need additional capital, and the sale of additional ADSs, Class Z ordinary shares, or other equity securities could result in additional
dilution to our shareholders, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness could increase our debt obligations.
      We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, strategic acquisitions or other future developments. If these
resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities.
The sale of additional equity and equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The sale of substantial amounts of our
Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs (including upon conversion of our convertible senior notes) could dilute the interests of our shareholders and
the ADS holders and adversely impact the trading price of our listed securities. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service
obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be
available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.


Conversion of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of the existing shareholders, including holders who had previously
converted their notes.
       The conversion of some or all of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes or the 2027 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing
shareholders and existing ADS holders. Any sales in the public market of the ADSs and/or Class Z ordinary shares issuable upon such conversion may
increase the opportunities to create short positions with respect to the ADSs, which could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our Class Z
ordinary shares and/or the ADSs. In addition, the existence of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes may encourage short
selling by market participants because the conversion of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes could depress the price of
our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs. The prices of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs could be affected by possible sales of our
Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs by investors who view the convertible senior notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and
by hedging or arbitrage trading activity, which we expect to occur involving our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs.

                                                                              67

Provisions of our convertible senior notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.
      Certain provisions of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a
third-party to acquire us, or may even prevent a third-party from acquiring us. For example, upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a
fundamental change, holders of the April 2026 Notes, the December 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to
repurchase all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes. In the event of a fundamental change, we may also be required to
increase the conversion rate for conversions in connection with such fundamental changes. By discouraging an acquisition of us by a third-party, these
provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their securities at a premium over prevailing market prices.


Our dual-class share structure with different voting rights will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from
pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial.
      We have a dual-class share structure such that our ordinary shares consist of Class Y ordinary shares and Class Z ordinary shares. In respect of
matters requiring the votes of shareholders, holders of Class Z ordinary shares will be entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class Y ordinary
shares will be entitled to ten votes per share based on our proposed dual-class share structure. The ADSs represent Class Z ordinary shares. Each
Class Y ordinary share is convertible into one Class Z ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof, while Class Z ordinary shares are not convertible
into Class Y ordinary shares under any circumstances. Upon any sale of Class Y ordinary shares by a holder thereof to any person other than Rui Chen,
Ni Li and Yi Xu or any entity which is not ultimately controlled by any of Rui Chen, Ni Li or Yi Xu, such Class Y ordinary shares shall be automatically
and immediately converted into the same number of Class Z ordinary shares.

       As of the date of this annual report, three of our directors, Rui Chen, Ni Li and Yi Xu, beneficially own all of our issued Class Y ordinary shares.
As of February 29, 2024, these Class Y ordinary shares constitute approximately 20.3% of our total issued and outstanding shares and approximately
71.8% of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding shares. As a result of the dual-class share structure and the concentration of
ownership, holders of Class Y ordinary shares will have considerable influence over matters such as decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the
sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. Such holders may take actions that are not in the
best interest of us or our other shareholders. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company,
which could have the effect of depriving our other shareholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company
and may reduce the price of our listed securities. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage
others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that our shareholders may view as beneficial.


The dual-class structure of our ordinary shares may adversely affect the trading market for the Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs.
       S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain
indices, including the S&P 500, to exclude companies with multiple classes of shares and companies whose public shareholders hold no more than 5%
of total voting power from being added to such indices. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of
multiple class structures. As a result, the dual-class structure of our ordinary shares may prevent the inclusion of the ADSs representing Class Z ordinary
shares in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise
seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for the ADSs. Any actions
or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of
the ADSs.

                                                                               68

Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market prices of the ADSs.
       Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third-party with the intention of buying
identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the
sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the
sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative
opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after
selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.

      Public companies listed in the United States that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of
the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and
accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud.
As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to
shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.

       It is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such
allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend
ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against
the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable federal or state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could
be costly and time-consuming and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be
groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations and stockholder’s equity, and the value of any investment in the ADSs
could be greatly reduced or rendered worthless.


Certain existing shareholders have substantial influence over our company and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other
shareholders.
       We have adopted a dual-class voting structure such that our ordinary shares consist of Class Z ordinary shares and Class Y ordinary shares. Based
on our dual-class voting structure, in respect of matters requiring a shareholders’ vote, holders of Class Z ordinary shares will be entitled to one vote per
share, while holders of Class Y ordinary shares will be entitled to ten votes per share. Due to the disparate voting powers attached to these two classes of
ordinary shares, three of our directors, Rui Chen, Ni Li and Yi Xu, beneficially own all of our issued Class Y ordinary shares. As of February 29, 2024,
these Class Y ordinary shares in aggregate constitute approximately 20.3% of our total issued and outstanding ordinary shares and approximately 71.8%
of the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding ordinary shares. They may take actions that are not aligned with the interests of our
shareholders, including the ADS holders. In addition, the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our
Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs due to investors’ perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.


If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding
our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs, the trading price and trading volume of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs could decline.
       The trading market for our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts
publish about our business. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our Class Z ordinary shares, the trading price for our Class Z ordinary
shares and/or the ADSs would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose
visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume for our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs to
decline.

                                                                              69

The sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs could adversely affect their trading price.
      Sales of substantial amounts of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur,
could adversely affect the trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through
equity offerings in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other
shareholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs.


Because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, investors must rely on price appreciation of our listed securities for return on
their investments.
      We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business.
As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, investors should not rely on an investment in our listed
securities as a source for any future dividend income.

       Our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain requirements of Cayman Islands law. Even
if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other
things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, we received from our
subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return to the
shareholders and/or ADS holders will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our listed securities. There is no guarantee that our
listed securities will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which the investors purchased these securities. Investors may not realize a return
on their investment in our listed securities and may even lose their entire investment.


Our shareholders may be subject to PRC income tax on dividends from us or on any gain realized on the transfer of our Class Z ordinary shares
and/or the ADSs.
       Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, subject to any applicable tax treaty or similar arrangement between
mainland China and the jurisdiction of residence of the holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs that provides for a different income tax
arrangement, PRC withholding tax at the rate of 10% is normally applicable to dividends from PRC sources payable to investors that are non-PRC
resident enterprises, which do not have an establishment or place of business in mainland China, or which have such establishment or place of business
if the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business. Any gain realized on the transfer of ADSs or ordinary
shares by such non-PRC resident enterprise investors is also subject to 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources
within mainland China, unless a tax treaty or similar arrangement provides otherwise. Under the PRC Individual Income Tax Law and its
implementation rules, dividends from sources within mainland China paid to foreign individual investors who are not PRC residents are generally
subject to a PRC withholding tax at a rate of 20% and gains from PRC sources realized by such investors on the transfer of ADSs and/or Class Z
ordinary shares are generally subject to 20% PRC income tax, in each case, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties and
similar arrangements and PRC laws. Although substantially all of our business operations are in mainland China, it is unclear whether dividends we pay
with respect to our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs, or the gain realized from the transfer of our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs,
would be treated as income derived from sources within mainland China and as a result be subject to PRC income tax if we were considered a PRC
resident enterprise, as described above. See “—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC
income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.” If PRC
income tax were imposed on gains realized through the transfer of the ADSs or on dividends paid to our non-PRC resident investors, the value of the
investment in our Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, the holders of our Class Z ordinary
shares and/or the ADSs whose jurisdictions of residence have tax treaties or similar arrangements with mainland China may not qualify for benefits
under such tax treaties or arrangements.

                                                                             70

There can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable
year, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of our Class Z ordinary shares or ADSs.
      A non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of
“passive” income; or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable
to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, or the asset test. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we
intend to treat the VIEs as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of
these entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in
our consolidated financial statements.

       Assuming that we are the owner of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and based upon the composition of our income and assets and
projections as to the value of our assets, including goodwill and other unbooked intangibles not reflected on our balance sheet, we do not believe that we
were a PFIC for the 2023 taxable year and we do not presently expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year. However, no assurance can be given in
this regard because the determination of whether we are or will become a PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends, in part,
upon the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares may cause us to become a PFIC
for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of our assets for the purpose of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market
price of the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares (which may be volatile). In particular, recent declines in the market price of the ADSs and Class Z ordinary
shares increased our risk of becoming a PFIC. The market price of the ADSs and Class Z ordinary shares may continue to fluctuate considerably and,
consequently, we cannot assure you of our PFIC status for any taxable year. The composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and
how quickly, we use our liquid assets. In addition, if it were determined that we do not own the stock of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
our risk of being a PFIC may substantially increase.

       If we are a PFIC in any taxable year, a U.S. Holder may incur significantly increased U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or
other disposition of the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares and on the receipt of distributions on the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares to the extent such
gain or distribution is treated as an “excess distribution” under U.S. federal income tax rules and such holder may be subject to burdensome reporting
requirements. Further, if we are a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares, we will generally continue
to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares. See “Item 10. Additional
Information—E. Taxation—Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”


Our memorandum and articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of
our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs.
       The eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our
company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity
to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender
offer or similar transaction. Our dual-class voting structure gives disproportionate voting power to the Class Y ordinary shares. In addition, our board of
directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations,
powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend
rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated
with our ordinary shares, in the form of ADS or otherwise. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change
in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our
Class Z ordinary shares and/or the ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs may be
materially and adversely affected.

                                                                               71

Our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests, and the ability to protect their rights through U.S. courts and Hong Kong courts
may be limited, because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.
       We are an exempted company limited by shares registered under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Our corporate affairs are governed by our
memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The
rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under
Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in
part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from the common law of England, the decisions of whose courts are
of persuasive authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our
directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in Hong Kong and some
jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than Hong Kong and the United States.
Some states in the United States, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman
Islands. In addition, with respect to Cayman Islands companies, plaintiffs may face special obstacles, including, but not limited to, those relating to
jurisdiction and standing, in attempting to assert derivative claims in state or federal courts of the United States. The Cayman Islands courts are also
unlikely to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States based on certain civil liability provisions of securities laws of the
United States, or to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of securities
laws of the United States that are penal in nature. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States,
although the courts of the Cayman Islands will in certain circumstances recognize and enforce a non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent
jurisdiction without retrial on the merits.

       Currently, shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate
records or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Our directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine
whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to
our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or
to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.

      Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, differ significantly from requirements for companies
incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States. To the extent we choose to follow home country practice with respect to corporate
governance matters, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic
issuers or Hong Kong issuers.

       There is uncertainty as to whether the judgment of United States courts will be directly enforced in Hong Kong, as the United States and Hong
Kong do not have a treaty or other arrangements providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts of the United States in
civil and commercial matters. However, a foreign judgment may be enforced in Hong Kong at common law by bringing an action in a Hong Kong court
since the judgment may be regarded as creating a debt between the parties to it; provided that the foreign judgment, among other things, is a final
judgment conclusive upon the merits of the claim and is for a liquidated amount in a civil matter and not in respect of taxes, fines, penalties, or similar
charges. Such a judgment may not, in any event, be so enforced in Hong Kong if (a) it was obtained by fraud; (b) the proceedings in which the judgment
was obtained were opposed to natural justice; (c) its enforcement or recognition would be contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong; (d) the court of
the United States was not jurisdictionally competent; or (e) the judgment was in conflict with a prior Hong Kong judgment.

      As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by
management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the
United States or Hong Kong. For a discussion of significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman
Islands and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders, see “Item 10. Additional Information—B.
Memorandum and Articles of Association—Differences in Corporate Law.”

                                                                              72

ADSs holders may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to claims arising under the deposit agreements, which could result in less favorable
outcomes to the plaintiff(s) in any such action.
       The deposit agreement and the deposit agreement for restricted securities governing the ADSs representing our Class Z ordinary shares provide
that, subject to the depositary’s right to require a claim to be submitted to arbitration, the federal or state courts in the City of New York have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and determine claims arising under the deposit agreements and in that regard, to the fullest extent permitted by law, ADS holders
waive the right to a jury trial of any claim they may have against us or the depositary arising out of or relating to our shares, the ADSs or the deposit
agreements, including any claim under the U.S. federal securities laws.

       If we or the depositary opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver, the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on
the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with the applicable U.S. state and federal law. To our knowledge, the enforceability of a
contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the U.S. federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the
United States Supreme Court. However, based on past court decisions, we believe that a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally
enforceable, including under the laws of the State of New York, which govern the deposit agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual
pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision, courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury
trial. We believe that this is the case with respect to the deposit agreements and the ADSs. It is advisable that you consult legal counsel regarding the
jury waiver provision before investing in the ADSs.

       If any holders or beneficial owners of ADSs bring a claim against us or the depositary in connection with matters arising under the relevant
deposit agreements or the ADSs, including claims under U.S. federal securities laws, you or such other holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled to
a jury trial with respect to such claims, which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and/or the depositary. If a lawsuit is
brought against us and/or the depositary under the relevant deposit agreements, it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court,
which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have had, including
results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff(s) in any such action.

      Nevertheless, if this jury trial waiver provision is not enforced, to the extent a court action proceeds, it would proceed under the terms of the
relevant deposit agreements with a jury trial. No condition, stipulation or provision of the relevant deposit agreements or ADSs serves as a waiver by
any holder or beneficial owner of ADSs or by us or the depositary of compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.


Certain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.
       We are a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares and all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all of
our current operations are conducted in mainland China. In addition, a majority of our current directors and officers named in this annual report are
nationals and residents of countries other than the United States or Hong Kong. Substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the
United States or Hong Kong. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for our shareholders to bring an action against us or against these individuals
in the United States in the event that such shareholders believe that their rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws, Hong Kong
laws, or otherwise. Even if such shareholders are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of mainland China
may render such shareholders unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.


As a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance
matters that differ significantly from the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards, and these practices may afford less protection to
shareholders than shareholders would enjoy if we complied fully with the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.
      As a Cayman Islands exempted company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, we are subject to the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.
However, the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its
home country. Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from the Nasdaq
corporate governance listing standards. We currently follow our home country practice that does not require us to seek shareholder approval for
amending our share incentive plan. As a result, our investors may not be provided with the benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of
Nasdaq.

                                                                              73

We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions
applicable to U.S. domestic public companies.
      Because we are a foreign private issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of
U.S. securities rules and regulations that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:
       •     the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q;
       •     or current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC;
       •     the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under
             the Exchange Act;
       •     the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for
             insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and
       •     the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.

       We are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our
results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Press releases relating to
financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K.

       However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be
filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, the ADS holders may not be afforded the same protections or information, which would be
made available to the ADS holders, were they investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.


ADS holders may have fewer rights than holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights.
      Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights as our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying Class Z
ordinary shares represented by the ADSs in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Holders of ADSs may not call a shareholders’
meeting, and do not have any direct right to attend general meetings of our shareholders or to cast any votes at such meetings. Under our eighth
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the minimum notice period required to convene a general meeting, other than the annual
general meeting, is 14 days. Under the deposit agreement, ADS holders must vote by giving voting instructions to the depositary. If we ask for ADS
holders’ instructions, then upon receipt of such voting instructions, the depositary will try to vote the underlying Class Z ordinary shares in accordance
with these instructions. If we do not instruct the depositary to ask for ADS holders’ instructions, the depositary may still vote in accordance with
instructions given by ADS holders, but it is not required to do so. ADS holders will not be able to directly exercise their rights to vote with respect to the
underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented by the ADSs unless they withdraw the Class Z ordinary shares and become the registered holders of such
Class Z ordinary shares prior to the record date for the general meeting.

       When a general meeting is convened, holders of ADSs may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders’ meeting to permit withdrawal of the
underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented by their ADSs to allow them to cast their votes with respect to any specific matter. If we ask for ADS
holders’ instructions, the depositary will notify ADS holders of the upcoming vote and will arrange to deliver our voting materials to the ADS holders.
We have agreed to give the depositary at least 30 business days’ prior notice of our shareholder meetings. Nevertheless, the depositary and its agents
may not be able to send voting instructions to holders of ADSs or carry out their voting instructions in a timely manner. We will make all reasonable
efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to holders of ADSs in a timely manner, but we cannot assure that holders of ADSs will receive the
voting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote their ADSs. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be
responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result,
holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to vote and may lack recourse if the underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented by their
ADSs are not voted as they requested.

                                                                             74

ADS holders may experience dilution of their holdings due to inability to participate in rights offerings.
       We may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under the deposit agreement, the depositary
will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt
from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. The
depositary may, but is not required to, attempt to sell these undistributed rights to third parties, and may allow the rights to lapse. We may be unable to
establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these
rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have a registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to
participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result.


ADS holders may be subject to limitations on transfer of their ADSs.
      In certain cases, the ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time to
time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may close its books from time to time for a number of
reasons, including in connection with corporate events such as a rights offering, during which time the depositary needs to maintain an exact number of
ADS holders on its books for a specified period. The depositary may also close its books in emergencies, and on weekends and public holidays. The
depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of the ADSs generally when our share register or the books of the depositary are closed, or
at any time if we or the depositary thinks it is advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or
under any provision of the relevant deposit agreement, or for any other reason.


The different characteristics of the capital markets in Hong Kong and the U.S. may negatively affect the trading prices of our Class Z ordinary
shares and/or ADSs.
       We are subject to Hong Kong and Nasdaq listing and regulatory requirements concurrently. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have
different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different
levels of retail and institutional participation). As a result of these differences, the trading prices of our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs may not be
the same, even allowing for currency differences. Fluctuations in the price of the ADSs due to circumstances peculiar to the U.S. capital markets could
materially and adversely affect the price of our Class Z ordinary shares, or vice versa. Certain events having significant negative impact specifically on
the U.S. capital markets may result in a decline in the trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares notwithstanding that such event may not impact the
trading prices of securities listed in Hong Kong generally or to the same extent, or vice versa. Because of the different characteristics of the U.S. and
Hong Kong capital markets, the historical market prices of the ADSs may not be indicative of the trading performance of our Class Z ordinary shares.


Exchange between our Class Z ordinary shares and the ADSs may adversely affect the liquidity and/or trading price of each other.
      The ADSs are currently traded on Nasdaq. Subject to compliance with U.S. securities law and the terms of the deposit agreement, holders of our
Class Z ordinary shares may deposit Class Z ordinary shares with the depositary in exchange for the issuance of the ADSs. Any holder of ADSs may
also withdraw the underlying Class Z ordinary shares represented by the ADSs pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement for trading on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange. In the event that a substantial number of Class Z ordinary shares are deposited with the depositary in exchange for ADSs or vice
versa, the liquidity and trading price of our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the ADSs on Nasdaq may be adversely
affected.

                                                                             75

There is uncertainty as to whether Hong Kong stamp duty will apply to the trading or conversion of the ADSs.
       Under the Hong Kong Stamp Duty Ordinance, any person who effects any sale or purchase of Hong Kong stock, defined as stock the transfer of
which is required to be registered in Hong Kong, is required to pay Hong Kong stamp duty. The stamp duty is currently set at a total rate of 0.2% of the
greater of the consideration for, or the value of, shares transferred, with 0.1% payable by each of the buyer and the seller. To the best of our knowledge,
Hong Kong stamp duty has not been levied in practice on the trading or conversion of ADSs of companies that are listed in both the United States and
Hong Kong and that have maintained all or a portion of their ordinary shares, including ordinary shares underlying ADSs, in their Hong Kong share
registers. However, it is unclear whether, as a matter of Hong Kong law, the trading or conversion of ADSs of these dual-listed companies constitutes a
sale or purchase of the underlying Hong Kong-registered ordinary shares that is subject to Hong Kong stamp duty. We advise investors to consult their
own tax advisors on this matter. If Hong Kong stamp duty is determined by the competent authority to apply to the trading or conversion of the ADSs,
the trading price and the value of your investment in our Class Z ordinary shares and/or ADSs may be affected.


The time required for the exchange between our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to
settle or effect any sale of their securities during this period, and the exchange of Class Z ordinary shares into ADSs involves costs.
       There is no direct trading or settlement between Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on which the ADSs and our Class Z ordinary shares
are respectively traded. In addition, the time differences between Hong Kong and New York, unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may
delay the deposit of Class Z ordinary shares in exchange for ADSs or the withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares underlying the ADSs. Investors will be
prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities during such periods of delay. In addition, there is no assurance that any exchange for
Class Z ordinary shares into ADSs (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines that investors may anticipate.

      Furthermore, the depositary for the ADSs is entitled to charge holders fees for various services including for the issuance of ADSs upon deposit of
Class Z ordinary shares, cancelation of ADSs, distributions of cash dividends or other cash distributions, distributions of ADSs pursuant to share
dividends or other free share distributions, distributions of securities other than ADSs and annual service fees. As a result, shareholders who exchange
Class Z ordinary shares into ADSs, and vice versa, may not achieve the level of economic return the shareholders may anticipate.


ITEM 4.       INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY
A. History and Development of the Company
      Our website was first launched in June 2009 and was officially named “bilibili” in January 2010. We commenced our commercial operations in
2011 and established Shanghai Hode Information Technology Co., Ltd., which we refer to as Hode Information Technology in this annual report, to
expand our operations in May 2013. Subsequently, we obtained control over Shanghai Kuanyu Digital Technology Co., Ltd., which we refer to as
Shanghai Kuanyu in this annual report, in July 2014 to further expand our operations.

      We incorporated Bilibili Inc. under the laws of the Cayman Islands, an exempted company with limited liability, as our offshore holding company
in December 2013. In February 2014, we established Hode HK Limited, or Hode HK, a wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary. In September 2014, Hode
HK established a wholly owned PRC subsidiary, Hode Shanghai Limited, which we refer to as Hode Shanghai in this annual report.

      Due to restrictions imposed by PRC laws and regulations on foreign ownership of companies that engage in internet and other related business,
Hode Shanghai later entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Hode Information Technology and Shanghai Kuanyu, and their respective
shareholders, and Chaodian Technology entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Chaodian Culture and its individual shareholders. We
have also entered into contractual arrangements with several other affiliated entities and their respective nominee shareholders, through some of our
subsidiaries other than Hode Shanghai or Chaodian Technology. As a result of our direct ownership in our WFOE and the VIE contractual arrangements,
we are regarded as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. We treat them and their subsidiaries as variable interest entities under U.S. GAAP, and have
consolidated the financial results of these entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

                                                                            76

      On March 28, 2018, the ADSs representing our Class Z ordinary shares commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol
“BILI.” We raised approximately US$443.3 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering after deducting underwriting commissions and the
offering expenses payable by us.

      In October 2018, Tencent became a major shareholder of ours and we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with it for sharing and
operating existing and additional anime and games on our platform. In December 2018, we and Taobao entered into a business collaboration agreement
in content-driven e-commerce and commercialization of our intellectual property assets.

     In March 2021, our Class Z ordinary shares commenced trading on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the stock code
“9626.” We raised approximately HK$22.9 billion (RMB19.3 billion) from our global offering, after deducting underwriting fees and other offering
expenses.

       On October 3, 2022, our voluntary conversion of Bilibili’s secondary listing status to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange became
effective, and Bilibili became a dual-primary listed company on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Hong Kong and the Nasdaq
Global Select Market in the United States.

      On March 13, 2023, the inclusion of our Class Z ordinary shares traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock
Connect and Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs became effective. Following its inclusion, eligible investors in mainland China currently
have direct access to the trading of Bilibili’s Class Z ordinary shares.

B. Business Overview
      We are an iconic brand and a leading video community for young generations in China. Video is an intuitive, vivid and informative way to
connect people with the world and has become a dominant medium for communication, entertainment and information. We refer to the trend of video
integrating into the scenarios of everyday life as “videolization.” As a go-to video community for young generations in China, we believe we are well
positioned to capture the attractive opportunities created by videolization.

      We are a full-spectrum video community that offers a wide array of content serving young generations’ diverse interests. We adopt “All the Videos
You Like” as our brand proposition. We have built our community around aspiring users, high-quality content, talented content creators and the strong
emotional bond among them. In our community, users and content creators discover and interact with diverse content encompassing different interests,
from lifestyle, game, entertainment, anime, knowledge to many more. We also enable broad video-based content consumption scenarios centered around
professional user generated videos, or PUGV, supplemented with live broadcasting, occupationally generated videos, or OGV, and more.

       We adopt a user-centric commercialization model. Our ever-growing content ecosystem continues to satisfy our engaged and loyal users’ evolving
needs, providing us with multiple levers for user-centric commercialization. We generate revenues primarily from VAS, advertising, mobile games, and
IP derivatives. Our cost of revenues consists of revenue-sharing costs, content costs, server and bandwidth costs, staff costs and IP derivatives and other
costs. For a detailed description, please see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Key Components of Results of Operations.”

                                                                            77

Our Users
      We have a young and culturally aspirational user base who are willing to invest in high-quality content and engaging user experience. Gen Z+,
individuals in China born between 1985 and 2009, constitutes the core of our user base. Our user base is broadening to include users across different age
groups and locations, who take interest in a full spectrum of content. We encourage users to not only discover and view, but also share and create quality
content on our platform. We are dedicated to providing a wide variety of high-quality content to retain our existing users and attract new users with
diverse interests and backgrounds.

      Our user base is growing solidly. In 2023, we had an average of 98 million DAUs and 329 million MAUs, representing an increase of 14% and
5%, respectively, as compared to 2022. Our users have demonstrated high levels of engagement on our platform. The average daily time spent per active
user on our mobile apps reached 97 minutes in 2023, and our total user time spent increased by 17% year over year. During the same period, we had
approximately 4.3 billion average daily video views, representing a 25% year-over-year growth. Our users generated over 15.1 billion average monthly
interactions on our platform, as compared to 13.2 billion in 2022.

       Our official members who have passed our 100-question multiple-choice membership exam are even more engaged and loyal to our platform. As
of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 230 million official members, representing an 18% year-over-year increase. We believe the users who take
and pass our membership exam are tuned to our community culture and values, which gives us a sticky user community with high retention rate. For
official members who visited our platform in each month since 2022, their 12th-month retention rate remained at around 80%.


Our Content
      We offer a wide variety of digital content, centered around PUGV and supplemented with a range of value-added services, or VAS, as well as
mobile games. Our full-spectrum content ecosystem makes us a one-stop platform for users to find content that matches their interests and preferred
video consumption scenarios, and for content creators to fully showcase their talent. In 2023, we had approximately 4.3 billion average daily video
views, representing a 25% year-over-year growth. The growth of our content ecosystem is propelled by a virtuous cycle. The more talented content
creators gather on our platform, the more inspiring and high-quality content is created, leading to more users, more engagement, and more followers and
feedback for our content creators, which in turn encourages more content creators to join.


PUGV
      PUGV are the cornerstone of our content ecosystem, contributing to over 95% of the total video views on our platform in 2023. With the
development of affordable and easy-to-use video-recording hardware, 5G technologies, and the latest AI-based content creation tools, the barrier to
producing quality video content is gradually coming down, allowing PUGV to become an increasingly popular content format.

      We have a deep and diverse repository of PUGV on our platform. The PUGV on our platform typically showcase the content creators’ knowledge
and expertise in the relevant field, providing viewers with a fulfilling experience and creating positive word-of-mouth. PUGV are popular among our
users due to their originality and creativity as well as their creators’ responsiveness to user demand. Since our inception, our PUGV experienced
continuous growth as the community of content creators on our platform expanded and became more diverse. In 2023, there were approximately
4.0 million monthly active content creators, as compared to an average of approximately 3.7 million in 2022.

       With the multifaceted support mechanisms and monetization avenues we provide to content creators, we receive increasingly diverse and
innovative content submissions from a growing number of content creators. In 2023, we received an average of approximately 21.5 million monthly
video submissions, as compared to 14.7 million in 2022, representing a 46% year-over-year growth. In 2023, our most popular PUGV categories were
lifestyle, game, entertainment, anime and knowledge in terms of number of video views. While we enhance content offerings in our leading categories,
we are actively expanding our content reach to new categories to cater to the evolving consumption needs of our users as they gradually mature. In
2023, the PUGV categories that demonstrated the highest growth in terms of video views were baby and maternity, automobiles, travel, and fashion and
clothing.

                                                                           78
Table of Contents

       We have also broadened our video formats to address users’ needs in different access scenarios. Our short-form video “Story Mode” on our
mobile apps caters to users’ video consumption needs in fragmented time. In 2023, Story Mode’s daily video views increased over 49% year-on-year,
while the video views of our PUGV content increased by 18% year-on-year, together fueling the growth of our total daily video views, which was up to
4.3 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 25% year-on-year. We also introduced Bilibili app on smart TV as a solution for users seeking high
quality, high resolution and immersive video experience on a larger screen.


VAS
     We offer a wide range of value-added services catering to our users’ diversified content needs, including live broadcasting, OGV, audio drama on
Maoer and comics on Bilibili Comic.


      Live broadcasting
       We view live broadcasting as a natural extension to our video content, which allows users to interact and engage in real time, and is integrated
with various content categories and user interests. We have a vast and varied collection of live broadcasting categories on our platform. Games are the
most popular category of the live broadcasting content on our platform. In 2023, we offered live broadcasting of the League of Legends S13 World
Championship. Our sponsored e-sports team advanced to the semifinals of the S13 World Championship, which was the best performance since the
team’s founding, driving the peak popularity index of our Bilibili official live broadcasting room to over 460 million, and attracting over 120 million
users to watch League of Legends-related content on our platform during the S13 season.

      In addition to live broadcasting of games, we also provide entertainment live broadcasting consisting of virtual host live broadcasting, audio-
related live broadcasting and other live broadcasting. We are dedicated to attracting more talents and hosts to introduce more live broadcasting channels
and provide diversified content. In 2023, we continued to integrate live broadcasting within our PUGV ecosystem, which has helped to motivate more
users and creators to tap into our live broadcasting universe, thus enriching our live broadcasting content and increasing user penetration. We believe the
diverse and growing live broadcasting content provides an interactive user experience and drives the growth of our live broadcasting revenues.


      OGV
      Our OGV offerings consist of Bilibili-produced or jointly produced content and licensed content procured from third-party production companies.
Our OGV offerings encompass a variety of genres, including anime, documentaries, variety shows, selected TV shows and movies. Anime remains our
core focus while we are continually making thoughtful investments in other content categories. We leverage our rich OGV offerings to attract more
users and convert them into paying users, inspire the creation of PUGV content creators and supplement the PUGV content categories. In 2023, we
adopted an OGV investment strategy that put more weight on return on investment as a selection criterion. As a result, with the continuous growth of
our net revenues, we expect our total content costs as a percentage of total revenue to gradually decrease.

       We have one of China’s largest anime libraries, encompassing Chinese anime and Japanese anime series. In 2023, one of our most viewed anime
series Yao-Chinese Folktales, a traditional Chinese-style anime we co-produced, generated over 300 million views on our platform. In September 2023,
we announced 68 new Chinese anime titles on our 6th Made by Bilibili Chinese Anime Press Conference. We have also established business
cooperation with overseas distributors, including Netflix and Sony, to distribute our original Chinese content to the global markets. In addition, we have
partnered with content providers for licensed videos, including leading PRC and overseas television networks and studios. See “—Our Strategic
Partners” for more information.

                                                                            79

      Bilibili Comic and Maoer
      Leveraging our mass user base of ACG (anime, comics and games) enthusiasts, we expanded our offering to comics and ACG-related audio
content. We launched Bilibili Comic, a mobile app offering anime and comic content in 2019 to enrich our content offerings. In the same year, to further
expand our content offerings, we started to offer audio drama such as audio books and music mainly contributed by professional and amateur content
creators that can be accessed through Maoer, an audio platform. As a natural extension from our core anime, comics, and games, or ACG content
offerings, we see synergy effects between our main offerings and each of Bilibili Comic and Maoer.


Mobile games
      There is a large population of online games enthusiasts among our users. Game is the second most popular category of our PUGV and the most
popular category of our live broadcasting content in 2023, positioning us as one of the most popular and active game communities in China. We view
mobile games as an adaptive form of video-based content that share many commonalities. Leveraging our deep understanding of users’ preference in
online games and our rich experience in games operation and distribution, we select and operate mobile games compatible with our users’ interest. As of
December 31, 2023, we operated multiple exclusively distributed mobile games and hundreds of jointly operated mobile games. In addition, we are
building up our internal game development capabilities.

      We have obtained the exclusive distribution rights of various mobile games from leading global and domestic mobile game developers. The most
popular exclusively distributed mobile games on our platform include Azur Lane and Fate/Grand Order. In addition to exclusively distributed mobile
games, we also jointly operate a large number of mobile games with well-known domestic developers. Popular jointly operated mobile games on our
platform include Genshin Impact and Arknights. We continued to leverage our competence in ACG entertainment with like-minded game players in
overseas markets, including South Korea, Japan, and other countries.


Our Content Creators
       The creation of PUGV by our content creators has been the primary source of user traffic and the key driver for the growth and engagement of our
communities. We have cultivated a supportive environment to allow content creators to grow and flourish on our platform, empowering them to easily
distribute content, quickly accumulate fan bases and effectively earn income. In 2023, we received an average of approximately 21.5 million monthly
videos submissions, as compared to 14.7 million in 2022. These videos were submitted by an average of approximately 4.0 million monthly active
content creators in 2023, as compared to an average of approximately 3.7 million in 2022.

      Retaining and expanding our network of content creators who continually contribute quality content to our platform is essential to us. We have
taken a number of initiatives to encourage and facilitate production of creative PUGV by content creators. We provide multiple monetization avenues
for our content creators to unlock their commercialization potential, including but not limited to native advertising, virtual gifting in live broadcasting,
other value-added services, customized commercial contracts and cash incentive programs. In 2023, over 3 million content creators earned income
through our multiple monetization channels, representing an increase of 30% year over year.

      All of our content creators and live broadcasting hosts are bound by our community regulations and standard terms of service, which set forth
various policies of conduct, content, privacy and the intellectual property right ownership, also the revenue sharing arrangements between content
creators and hosts and us. Most content creators and hosts are not professional or full time. We identify certain content creators and talent that create
popular content and represents our values and beliefs and execute customized contracts with them. We also cooperate with talent agencies which recruit,
manage, train, support and promote content creators and hosts. Customized host contracts are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and generally contain
revenue sharing arrangements and exclusivity clauses. Except as disclosed above, we do not have other material transactions, agreements or
understanding with our content creators or live broadcasting hosts, other than in their capacity as our content creators or live broadcasting hosts.

      Our users are attracted to our platform because of our creative content and retained by our diverse, inclusive and vibrant community. To preserve
our culture and community values, we have employed the following features in operating our communities.

                                                                              80

      Membership exam. Users need to pass our multiple-choice membership exam consisting of 100 questions in order to become our “official
members,” after which additional interactive and community features, such as bullet chatting and commenting, will become available to them. The
membership exam includes questions on community etiquette regarding uploading videos and sending bullet chats, and a set of interest-based questions
from a range of topics, such as anime, music, fashion and technology. Users need to answer a total of 60 questions correctly to pass the membership
exam. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 230 million official members who had passed our membership exam, representing an 18%
increase year over year.

       Signature community management. We believe official members who have passed the membership exam tend to develop a strong sense of
belonging and ownership to our platform. To protect the community values and contribute to a more harmonious community, our veteran users have
voluntarily formed a community discipline committee to collectively evaluate the appropriateness of content posted on our platform, the results of which
will be used to train our AI system for content and information monitoring on our platform. If we confirm that a user has uploaded content that contains
inappropriate content, such as pornography, violence, provocative or hate speech, invasion of personal privacy, personal attacks, and fraudulent or other
offensive information, we may temporarily suspend or permanently terminate such user’s account, and display such user’s account information and
reason for the disciplinary action under the “Dark Chamber” tab, which is open to all users on our platform. This measure also allows users to
participate in the management of our communities and helps us educate users and foster a self-regulating environment to preserve and strengthen the
community values that we hold dear. See “—Content Management and Review.”

       Community events. Every year, we hold large festivals and community events for our users, including New Year’s Eve Gala, Bilibili Power Up
Award, Chinese New Year Gala, Bilibili Macro Link and Bilibili World. In July 2023, we hosted Bilibili World and Bilibili Macro Link in Shanghai,
attracting a gathering of over 200,000 audiences to experience our unique community culture. We marked the end of the year with our New Year’s Eve
Gala, the Most Beautiful Night of 2023, which emerged as a popular online New Year’s celebration for young generations in China. In January 2024, we
hosted the 2023 Bilibili Power Up Awards to celebrate and award the outstanding achievements of leading content creators in various categories.


Our social and interactive features
      Our communities are built on creative content as well as vibrant interactions among users. Users’ interactions on our platform revolve around
content, and the social and interactive features of our platform allow users who share similar interests and hobbies to find, engage with and bond with
each other to form an in-depth emotional connection. We provide the following social and interactive features for our users. In 2023, our users generated
15.1 billion average monthly interactions on our platform, as compared to 13.2 billion in 2022.

       Bullet chatting. Bullet chatting is a commenting function that we pioneered, which enables content viewers to send comments that fly across the
screen like bullets, and has become very popular among young internet users in China. Only official member who passed our membership exam can
send bullet chats on our platform. Bullet chats are context-based and can be viewed by the audiences who watch the same content, and therefore can
intrigue interactive commenting among content viewers. The bullet chatting feature has transformed the video-viewing experience from one-way
content display to a brand-new interactive experience by sharing with other enthusiasts who empathize with each other.

      Other interactive features. Users can show appreciation in various ways to encourage content creators, such as liking, voting, following, adding to
favorites, and casting coins. Users can also opt to follow a content creator so they can see the content creator’s newly posted activities promptly on their
own timeline. In addition, we invented a unique interaction feature, “one click triple-function combo.” Through one long pressing on the screen, users
can complete liking, coin casting and adding to favorite library in a roll to show their special appreciation, which has become Bilibili signature
interactive function and been widely used in our community.

       Interacting with fans. Content creators can use moment, live broadcasting and interactive video to interact with their fans. Bilibili moment enables
users to express and share their interests and stories in multimedia content such as text, pictures and video. Bilibili live broadcasting allows content
creators to set up channels to interact with fans on a real-time basis and express their appreciation to the talents of live broadcasting host by virtual
gifting.

                                                                             81

      Gifting and rewarding. Users can send free or paid virtual items to content creators and live broadcasting hosts to show their support and
appreciation.

      Sharing and communicating. Users can share and repost content uploaded by other users, add comments, send instant messages and view their
history of interactions with other users.


Our Platform
      Our platform includes our “Bilibili” mobile apps, websites, Smart TV and other smart devices, Bilibili Comic, Maoer and a variety of related
features, functionalities, tools and services that we provide to users and content creators. For mobile devices, users typically access our content through
our Bilibili mobile apps, or a mobile website that is largely similar in terms of functionality and appearance to our mobile apps. Our mobile apps are
available for user download from the Apple and Android app stores. We also provide a website at www.bilibili.com and offer quality content across on
smart TV devices.

      We utilize our big data analytical capabilities in our feed system to categorize and recommend content based on user data captured on our platform
and analytics produced by our deep learning algorithms. The basic features we offer on our platform include content uploading, viewing and
commenting. Our platform also can categorize, rank, search for, curate and recommend content uploaded and viewed to simplify the content discovery
process.


Our Commercialization Model
       With our engaged user base, expanding content ecosystem, and vibrant community, we are well positioned to capture users’ evolving demand and
increase lifetime value of our users by satisfying such demand. As we develop deep insights into user interests and behavior, we curate the right content
and service offerings compatible with user demand, achieving efficient user-centric commercialization. We generate revenues primarily from VAS,
advertising, mobile games, and IP derivatives and others. In 2023, our total net revenues were RMB22.5 billion, representing a 3% increase from our
total net revenues of RMB21.9 billion in 2022.

      In 2023, we furthered our efforts at improving our commercialization efficiency, enhancing our gross profit and narrowing our losses. We
continued to direct our resources towards bolstering our core commercialization initiatives. To leverage our expanding user traffic more efficiently, we
further integrated our advertising and VAS businesses into our ecosystem to drive quality revenue growth. Increased revenue contribution from our high-
margin advertising business, which increased from 23.1% to 28.5% between 2022 and 2023, alongside our effective cost controls, drove a 41% year-
over-year increase in our gross profit in 2023. Our gross profit margin increased from 17.6% in 2022 to 24.2% in 2023.


VAS
     We provide various types of VAS offerings, including live broadcasting, premium membership program, audio drama on Maoer, comics on Bilibili
Comic, premium courses, and community avatar decorations.

     We extend diversified live broadcasting content covering a broad range of interests. We offer various virtual items for sale on our live
broadcasting. Users can purchase in-app virtual items and send them as virtual gifts to their favorite hosts to show appreciation and provide them with
monetary rewards. As we continue to integrate our live broadcasting ecosystem within our PUGV ecosystem, more content creators transit to live
broadcasting hosts to monetize their talents, which is expected to drive the continued growth of revenue generated from sales of virtual items.

       We share revenues from the sales of virtual items generated on our live broadcasting with our hosts and talent agencies. We encourage our content
creators to host live broadcasting on our platform to interact with their fans on a real time basis, enhance their popularity and in turn attract and retain
users. We have entered into exclusive cooperation agreements with certain hosts with top popularity on our platform, pursuant to which we offer these
hosts more attractive rewards in addition to the revenue-sharing arrangements. The top ten content creators and live broadcasting hosts contributed to
less than 1% of our total revenues during 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

                                                                             82

      Our premium membership program allows paying members to enjoy exclusive or advance access to certain high-quality OGV content. We charge
our premium members’ membership fees monthly, quarterly or annually, based on the service package that they select. As of December 31, 2023, we
had 21.9 million premium members. Over 80% of them were annual or auto-renew premium membership package subscribers, which illustrates our
users’ trust in our brand and content offerings.

       We also offer anime and comic content through the mobile app, Bilibili Comic, and offered audio drama through Maoer audio to expand our
content offerings. As a natural extension from our core ACG content offerings, we see great synergy effects between our main platform and each of the
Bilibili Comic and Maoer platform. We also offer pay-to-view premium courses and community avatar decorations on our platform.


Advertising
       Our typical users are the Gen Z+ population, many of whom are well educated and have decent disposable income and strong purchasing power.
This group of users are a golden cohort that advertisers pursue very strongly. Our rapidly growing community and increasing brand awareness make
Bilibili an appealing platform for advertisers wishing to gain more exposure to this highly coveted group.

      We offer various advertising formats including performance-based, brand, and native advertising. Performance-based advertisements appear in
various formats, such as video or picture feeds alongside organic feeds, a banner underneath the video-playing frame, a link, banner or pop-up in the
Story Mode, and a link in the comment section appearing below the video. Brand advertisements primarily appear on the app opening page, the top
banner, the website home page banner and the inline video feed alongside organic feeds. Brand advertisements can also be customized according to
advertisers’ need and appear in Bilibili-produced OGV or events. Native advertisings are customized according to advertisers’ needs, produced by our
content creators and embedded naturally in their video creations.

      In addition, we offer integrated marketing campaigns to provide a one-stop marketing solution for our advertisers. Advertisers can leverage our
brand advertising to raise their brand awareness, use native advertisements to influence user’s purchase decision and convert sales through our
performance-based advertisements. The all-around marketing campaigns were well received by the users and brought satisfactory results for our
advertisers. In 2023, we have integrated direct sale conversion tools into our video and live commerce advertising products to create more advertising
opportunities across our content ecosystem. We have also further improved our advertisement algorithm based on our enhanced understanding of our
users’ consumption needs and behaviors. We will continue to integrate advertising solutions into our ecosystem in a natural and seamless way, as well as
optimize the accuracy and efficiency of our advertising algorithms. We believe that these initiatives will enable us to achieve effective monetization of
the high-quality user traffic on our platform.

       The price of our advertising service is determined on a case-by-case basis and depends upon various factors, including the format and duration of
the advertisement, targeting scope, display location and so on. We provide various sales incentives to our advertising customers, including cash
incentives in the form of commissions to certain third-party advertising agencies and non-cash incentives such as discounts and advertising services
provided free of charge in certain bundled arrangements, which are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis with customers. The incentives are based
on revenue volume and incentive rate, which are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. We account for these incentives granted to customers as
variable consideration in accordance with ASC 606 that is net of our revenues. The amount of variable consideration is measured based on the most
likely amount of incentive to be provided to customers. We do not have other material transactions, agreements or understanding with our advertising
customers, other than in their capacity as our advertising customers.


Mobile games
      As a key component of ACG culture, games are the second most popular genre category of our PUGV based on video views in 2023. A
substantial portion of our users are game lovers. Mobile games have therefore become a natural extension of our video content offerings and a part of
our commercialization strategy since 2014. We offer our game lovers with exclusive distributed mobile games, jointly operated mobile games, as well as
self-developed mobile games.

                                                                           83
Table of Contents

       As our user base expanded, we continued to launch new service offerings and diversified our monetization channels beyond mobile games. As a
result, while our net revenues continued to grow, revenues contribution of mobile games as a percentage of total net revenues decreased over the past
few years. We derived 26.3%, 22.9% and 17.8% of our revenues from mobile games in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

      The majority of mobile games on our platform are developed by third-party developers and we select and curate mobile games on our platform
based on content, themes, cultural characteristics and features that appeal to our users. Our users access the mobile games on our platform, and log into
and play with their Bilibili accounts. Users’ purchase of in-game virtual items to enhance their game-playing experiences is the primary source of our
revenue generated from mobile games. As of December 31, 2023, we operated multiple exclusively distributed mobile games and hundreds of jointly
operated mobile games.

     For our exclusively distributed mobile games, we generally were granted royalty bearing license with the exclusive right to market and distribute
mobile games in China and other countries and regions in Asia. We are responsible for game launch, hosting and maintenance of game servers, game
promotions and customer services. We also develop localized versions for games licensed from overseas developers. Our exclusively distributed mobile
games contributed to 71.3%, 65.0% and 63.1% of our mobile games revenues during 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

      For our jointly operated mobile games, we entered into joint operating agreements with game developers and distributors pursuant to which we
were granted non-exclusive licenses to promote and distribute games on our platform. We negotiate revenue sharing arrangements or licensing fees with
mobile game developers on a case-by-case basis and such arrangements are generally consistent with industry norms. We earn game distribution service
revenue within the applicable contract periods by providing payment solutions and game promotion services, while game developers are responsible for
providing game products, hosting and maintaining game servers and determining the pricing of in-game virtual items.

     To cater to the young generation’s game demand, we are also building up our internal game development capabilities, leveraging our deep
understanding of user preferences and our rich game operation experience.


IP derivatives and others
       Our IP derivatives and others business is focused on the derivative merchandise of ACG-related content. We offer ACG-related merchandise and
generate revenue from sales of these products. For example, for users who are particularly interested in a certain anime, we recommend to them
merchandise of the same theme, such as figure toys, and convert into sales on our e-commerce platform. We also generate revenue from certain offline
activities we hold, including e-sports copyright sub-licensing, selling events tickets and peripheral products.


Our Strategic Partners
      We collaborate with reputable industry players to enhance our content offerings and to strengthen our user-centric commercialization capabilities.
We partner with domestic and overseas content partners to continually expand and deepen our content repository. We also work with talent agencies in
expanding our content creator group as well as in diversifying our content offerings. We contract with talent agencies to recruit, manage, train and
support our hosts and pay talent agencies a percentage of the total revenues from virtual gifting made to the hosts managed by such talent agencies. We
work with advertisers in a variety of industries due to our rapidly growing community and increasing brand awareness. We enter into advertising service
agreements with advertisers directly or through advertising agencies. The price of our advertising services depends upon various factors, including the
duration and form of the advertisements and popularity of the content or event in which the advertisements will be placed. We cooperate with leading
global and domestic mobile game developers to distribute their mobile games on our platform. Under our agreements for exclusively distributed mobile
games, we are typically responsible for the launch of the games, hosting and maintenance of game servers, determination of when and how to operate
in-game promotions and customer services and the pricing of in-game virtual items, and making localized versions for overseas licensed games. Under
our agreements for jointly operated mobile games, we are typically responsible for distributing games and providing payment solution and market
promotion service. Proceeds earned from selling in-game virtual items are shared between us and the third-party game developers pursuant to the
agreements. We believe our large and diverse user base presents a prime opportunity for our strategic partners to reach a growing number of audiences.
We have also entered into revenue sharing arrangements with distribution channels including iOS and Android-based app stores to distribute our mobile
games. To provide multiple payment methods for our users, we contracted with online payment channels and pay fees based on the amount of payment
made through the payment channel.

                                                                            84

       In October 2018, Tencent, a major shareholder of ours, further invested in our company, and we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement
with Tencent for sharing and operating existing and additional anime and games on Bilibili’s online platform, pursuant to which we and Tencent shall
participate in the exchange and purchase of existing anime copyright, and jointly procure, produce and invest in anime projects, as well as seek
investment opportunities in the anime and comic industry. In addition, we would expand our cooperation with Tencent by jointly operating more Tencent
games on our platform.

       In April 2020, we received a strategic investment from Sony and entered into a business collaboration agreement to pursue collaboration
opportunities within the area of entertainment business in the Chinese market, including anime and mobile game. We would support Sony in deepening
its understanding of and insight into the Chinese entertainment market. In October 2020, we deepened our partnership with Sony by entering into a
strategic agreement with its subsidiary Aniplex Inc. to introduce more high-quality anime content and mobile games on our platform. Under the
agreement, we will obtain certain exclusive distribution rights of Aniplex’s anime content and will pay Aniplex different fees per episode for different
anime series. We also entered into revenues sharing arrangements for exclusive distribution of Aniplex’s mobile games. We also collaborated with
Funimation, the global anime streaming platform of Sony, to distribute our Chinese anime works to the worldwide audiences.

       We and Alibaba Group have engaged in business collaborations in content creation and commercialization since 2018. Subsequently, Alibaba has
become one of our major brand advertisers. In 2023, we deepened our cooperation with Taobao in the field of video and live commerce advertising by
enabling direct links or banners and pop-ups that could directly link to Taobao’s website in our products. We also started data collaboration with Alibaba
to better understand our users’ consumption behaviors and preferences and further improve the accuracy and efficiency of our advertising
recommendation algorithms.


Branding and Marketing
      We have been retaining and expanding our user base by providing high-quality content since our inception, and we have cultivated a deep and
diverse content pool well recognized among Generation Z+. In addition to viral marketing, word of mouth referrals and repeat user visits driven by
superior user experience, quality content and product offerings, we implement various branding and marketing measures to promote our brand
awareness among existing and potential users with prudently managed sales and marketing expenses.

      In keeping with our slogan, Bilibili-All the Videos You Like, we held various activities to reinforce our impacts across different user demographics.
For example, in October 2023, we held the Super Scientific Night, which introduced many of the latest scientific discoveries to our young users and
inspired them to learn more about technology. The event illustrated our value proposition as a platform to offer useful and fulfilling content to the young
generations in China. We closed the year of 2023 with our fifth New Year’s Eve Gala, the Most Beautiful Night of 2023, which emerged as a popular
online New Year’s celebration for the young generations in China. The event garnered 100 million playbacks within 24 hours and received the most
industry sponsor participation since its launch. These branding and marketing initiatives have allowed us to connect and resonate with more users and
expand to more diverse audience.


User Privacy and Safety
      The vitality and integrity of our communities are cornerstones of our business. We dedicate significant resources to the goal of strengthening our
communities through developing and implementing programs designed to protect user personal information, promote a safe environment, and ensure the
security of user personal information. The user privacy policy, Bilibili Privacy Policy, on our platform describes our business scenarios for handling user
information and the processing rules and protection measures for personal information on our platform. Specifically, we provide users with adequate
notice and authorization as to what personal information are being processed and undertake to protect and process the personal information in
accordance with applicable laws and make reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized use, loss or leak of user personal information. Our user privacy
policy, Bilibili Privacy Policy, has clearly specified the type of user personal information that will be collected under different scenarios. For example, a
user will need to provide phone number to receive verification code when registering an account on our platform. When a user downloads (including the
re-download after uninstallation) and opens our mobile app for the first time, or any modification is made to the Bilibili Privacy Policy, we will notify
the user of the Bilibili Privacy Policy in a pop-up window and obtain the user’s explicit consent.

                                                                             85
Table of Contents

       We recently updated Bilibili Privacy Policy in line with the development of PRC laws and regulations. The primary updates include modifications
related to account registration and log-in, disclosure of account information, real-name authentication, customized recommendations, and the necessity
to maintain and enhance the security of our products and services. In addition, we have conducted comprehensive reviews and updates of the personal
information processing rules for each function of our platform, including the review of data usage in business operations with external business partners.
We have also enhanced users’ rights to manage their personal information, such as by including an option for users to obtain a copy of personal
information, imposing constraints on automated decision-making by the information system, and addressing user requests. We have provided more
detailed descriptions of our business practices related to managing user information, as well as the processing rules and protective measures for personal
information on our platform.

       We use a variety of technologies to protect the user personal information with which we are entrusted and have a team of information security
professionals dedicated to the ongoing implementation of data security practices. For example, we store all user personal information in encrypted
format and strictly limit the number of personnel who can access those servers that store user personal information. For our external interfaces, we also
utilize firewalls to protect against potential attacks or unauthorized access.


Content Management and Review
       We maintain two levels of content management and review procedures to monitor the content uploaded to our platform to help ensure that no
content that may be deemed to be illegal or inappropriate under government rules and regulations is posted and to promptly remove any infringing
content. The first level of review procedure is conducted through our proprietary artificial intelligence-based screening system. This system
automatically flags and screens out newly uploaded videos that have piracy issues or contain illegal or inappropriate content by comparing them with
copyrighted or objectionable videos stored in our own in-house “blacklist” databases and identifying those with similar codes. Once the content is
processed by our technology screening system, our system then extracts fingerprint trails from the content and sends them to our content screening team
for the second-level review. In 2023, leveraging the fast-developing AI large language models, we have improved our AI-based screening capabilities,
which led to a significant improvement in the efficiency of our overall content management and review team. As of December 31, 2023, our content
screening team consists of over 2,800 employees dedicated to screening and monitoring the content uploaded on our platform to ensure that the flagged
content identified by our screening system is reviewed and confirmed before it can be released. We provide initial training during the onboarding
process for new hires. We also offer periodic training sessions to keep these employees apprised of any regulatory and policy changes, and supervise and
monitor their work. All of the content needs to go through these two levels of review procedures before it is released on our platform.

       All of the other content, primarily consisting of bullet chats posted by users, is also automatically filtered by our screening system, which utilizes
an artificial intelligence-based screening system to conduct semantic analysis on bullet chats to analyze, identify and screen out inappropriate bullet
chats. With respect to live broadcasting, we have a separate monitoring team to review and monitor the content and activities of hosts of our live
broadcasting as well as the bullet chats posted by viewers. The monitoring team for live broadcasting consisted of about 300 members as of the date of
this annual report, and we sometimes assign more team members from our general content screening team as necessary. The live broadcasting reviewing
process is similar to the two-level review procedure described above. Further, in addition to responding to user complaints, our monitoring team
frequently visit different live broadcasting rooms to ensure the appropriateness of the content.

                                                                             86
Table of Contents

      We utilize a real-name system to authenticate the identities of our content creators and live broadcasting hosts. In addition, before each upload, the
user has agreed to the terms and conditions set forth in the user agreement of our platform. Pursuant to such user agreement, each user undertakes not to
upload or distribute content that violates any PRC laws or regulations or infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, and agrees to
indemnify us for all damages arising from third-party claims against us caused by violating or infringing content uploaded or linked by the user.
Cooperation agreements with our popular content creators also provide for standard clauses that restrict the content creators from uploading infringing
content on our platform. We also remove users’ uploads when we are notified or made aware by copyright owners or from other sources authorized by
copyright owners of copyright infringements, such as lists of inappropriate or infringing content that the regulatory authorities publish from time to time
and market information on releases of movies and television serial drama.

       Our abuse reporting infrastructure allows our users to report inappropriate, offensive or dangerous content to us through “report” links easily
found on our platform. Users can also report through customer service staff or third-party organizations. In addition, if we confirm that user has
uploaded content that contains provocative and hate speech, personal attacks, fraudulent information or other offensive information, we may temporarily
suspend or permanently terminate such user’s account, and display such user’s account information and reason for the disciplinary action under the
“Dark Chamber” tab, which is open to all users on our platform. To protect the community values and contribute to a more harmonious community, our
veteran users have voluntarily formed a community discipline committee to collectively evaluate the appropriateness of content posted on our platform,
the results of which will be used to train our AI system for content monitoring.

       However, there can be no assurance that we can identify all the videos or other content that may violate relevant laws and regulations due to the
large amount of content uploaded by our users every day. As advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, if the content of audio-visual
programs transmitted by the internet audio-visual program service provider on the internet violate the PRC laws and regulations such as the
Administrative Regulations on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service, the internet audio-visual program service provider may face, among others,
warnings, fines, revocation of license and even criminal investigations or penalties. “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—
Regulation—Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.” If such content violates the Provisional Measures on
Administration of Internet Culture, operating internet culture entities may face, among others, order to rectify, confiscation of illegal proceeds, fines,
revocation of license and even criminal investigations or penalties. “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—
Regulations Related to Internet Cultural Activities.” The Cyberspace Administration of China conducted a nationwide inspection of major internet
platforms providing short-video content, and we were notified by certain smartphone app stores in China that our mobile app had been temporarily
removed from July 26, 2018 until August 25, 2018. We implemented the required measures promptly and reinstated the mobile app downloads from
those app stores on August 26, 2018. We thereafter conducted a self-inspection by taking a comprehensive review of the content on our platform and
have hired more content monitoring personnel. On December 3, 2020, in response to the reported vulgar content on our platform, the Shanghai
Municipal Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal Publication, the Shanghai Municipal Internet Information Office and the Shanghai Municipal Culture
and Tourism Bureau made inquiries with us and requested us to rectify within two weeks and strengthen the content review of videos, live broadcasting,
anime, bullet chatting and other content on our platform. We have completed the required rectification. We have submitted the final rectification report
to the Shanghai Municipal Office of Anti-Pornography and Illegal Publication and the Shanghai Municipal Internet Information Office on December 22,
2020 and our rectification report has been accepted by the relevant competent authorities, which indicates that the rectification has passed the review of
relevant competent authority.

       According to Notice 78, platforms providing online show live broadcasting or e-commerce live broadcasting services shall, among other things,
register their information and business operations by November 30, 2020, ensure real-name registration for all live broadcasting hosts and virtual gifting
users, prohibit users that are minors or without real-name registration from virtual gifting, and set a limit on the maximum amount of virtual gifting per
time, per day, and per month.

      We have consulted with our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, as to the applicability and interpretation of the requirements under Notice 78 to
our business, and conducted an internal evaluation of our compliance measures and status of compliance with the requirements under Notice 78. We
have employed the following measures to comply with Notice 78 and ensure the appropriateness of live broadcasting content:
      (i)    we have communicated with Shanghai Municipal Administration of Radio and Television and were informed that currently we are not
             required to register in this system;

                                                                            87
Table of Contents

     (ii)    we have adopted policies to require real-name registration through identity card for all hosts from 2016, and require real-name registration
             through mobile number for all virtual gifting users from 2018;
     (iii)   we have set up the youth mode from May 2019, under which users are prohibited from virtual gifting. Under the general mode, from early
             January 2021, the users who can be identified as minors are not allowed to make virtual gifts and if adult users can prove that the virtual
             gifts are paid by minors, they can claim for refund; our Youth Mode was established under the direction of the Cyberspace Administration
             of China, when an user launches our app for the first time every day, the user can switch to the Youth Mode according to the pop-up
             prompt, and the browsing content under the Youth Mode is presented in the form of whitelist by our content team, and parents can set up
             passcodes under the Youth Mode to manage the time spent by minors on our platform and to prevent minors from switching back to
             general mode. In addition to the Youth Mode which has been implemented on the platform, we have also launched the “Youth Firewall”
             program in April 2018 and co-established a “Minors’ Rights Protection Center” in May 2018 to adopt special content presentation policies
             and community permission settings for users who are not authenticated or whose identities are shown as minors, so as to strictly identify
             and filter undesirable information for minors. After consultation with our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, we confirm that the
             operation of content under the Youth Mode is compliant with PRC laws and regulations in all material aspects;
     (iv)    with respect to the requirement of setting a cap on the amount of virtual gifting, as advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng,
             currently there has been no explicit provisions on the standard for the maximum amount of virtual gifting under Notice 78. Since we have
             not received any notice or implementation guidance on setting such cap on virtual gifting, we have not been able to set such cap or
             quantify the impact of such requirement on our business operations and financial performance as of the date of this annual report. We
             intend to continue communicating with the National Radio and Television Administration and its local branches with respect to the
             standard for the maximum amount of virtual gifting. Once the National Radio and Television Administration provides specific
             implementation guidelines on the maximum amount of virtual gifting, we will be able to take measures to comply with the requirement on
             a timely basis; and
     (v)     in relation to the other requirements under Notice 78, we believe that we have effective measures in place to ensure compliance with them
             in all material respects. However, given that certain requirements under Notice 78 remain unclear, we will continue communicating with
             regulatory authorities to seek more detailed guidelines with respect to the implementation of Notice 78.

      As advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, Notice 78 does not stipulate any timelines for full compliance with the requirements
therein, nor any penalties for any non-compliance under Notice 78. We have not received any notice of enforcement actions nor have we been subject to
any administrative penalties in connection with any non-compliance under Notice 78 as of the date of this annual report. For more information, see
“Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We face uncertainties with respect to the enactment,
interpretation and implementation of Notice 78 and Notice 3” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—
Regulations Related to Online Live Broadcasting Services.”


Corporate Social Responsibility
       Since our establishment, we have continued to fulfill our commitments to our users, employees and society. We have integrated environmental,
social and governance, or the ESG, consideration into our decision-making and development, and we actively communicated these goals to all
stakeholders. We believe that technology can empower society, and that positive and engaging content can make a significant impact. Our focus is to
enrich the everyday life of young people, create an outstanding community for our users, provide a platform for content creators to showcase their
talents, and promote Chinese original content worldwide.

      On April 27, 2023, we published our 2022 ESG Annual Report, which outlines our ESG policies, outcomes and performances for that year. The
report highlighted our commitment as a responsible public company to provide positive social and cultural value to our users, content creators,
employees and society. As we continually dedicate ourselves to developing and enhancing our ESG initiatives, we have successfully elevated our MSCI
ESG rating from B to BBB between 2020 and 2023.

                                                                           88

      In 2023, we remain committed to fulfilling our social responsibilities through leveraging our community. Our Bilibili Charity platform, an online
public fundraising platform created for charity organizations in support of the greater good of the society, launched over 70 charity fundraising programs
to support a variety of underprivileged groups in 2023. Meanwhile, we continued to support and facilitate rural education by assisting in the construction
of several Bilibili primary schools in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces in China. We helped establish the sixth Bilibili primary school, Bilibili soccer
school, to enable underprivileged rural students to achieve their sports dreams. Furthermore, as part of our commitment to promoting positivity and
knowledge-sharing content, we utilized our content ecosystem to contribute positively to society.

      As the majority of our operations are conducted online, our carbon footprint is limited, but we actively take responsibility to support sustainable
operations, and we continue to explore ways to improve energy efficiency. In 2023, led by our environmental management goals, we continued to
implement effective environmentally protective practices. We rolled out energy-efficient office facilities and encouraged our employees to conserve
resources, including water, electricity, paper, and office supplies. We work with business partners aligned with our commitment to carbon emission
reduction. All our servers comply with industry energy standards in China. We also have assessed the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities,
and we established internal guidelines for green technology, product innovation, and optimized operations. Additionally, we utilized our content
platform to raise public awareness about environmental topics.

       We comply strictly with legal and regulatory requirements in our operating countries and regions. We prioritize the establishment and maintenance
of risk management and internal control systems. Our risk management and internal control systems cover financial reporting, internal control, data, and
technology system risk management. Cybersecurity and information security are of particular importance to us, and we have established internal policies
to manage security risk, including Information Security Red Line (Preliminary Edition), Cybersecurity Protocol, and Bilibili Data Security Management
Protocols. We have established a three-level information security management structure under the leadership of our board of directors that is responsible
for our information security. To ensure governance, we have a defined structure that clarifies roles and responsibilities. We offer periodic employee
training, conduct self-inspection on information security, and receive inspections from third-party organizations. We also ask our suppliers to follow our
stipulations for business engagements related to security risks and approaches for security incidents. Over 80% of our businesses have received ISO
certifications for information security.


Competition
      We compete primarily with companies that operate in the video-based industry in China designed to engage users, especially the Gen Z+, and
capture their time spent on mobile devices and online. We compete to attract, engage and retain users, attract and retain content creators to expand our
content library and to attract and retain advertisers. Our competitors may compete with us in a variety of ways, including by leveraging a large user base
to promote content offerings in different consumption scenarios, obtaining exclusive online distribution rights for popular content, conducting brand
promotions and other marketing activities, and making acquisitions. We have exclusive distribution rights only for certain content on our platform. Our
content creators are generally free to post their content on our competitors’ platforms, which may divert user traffic from our platform.

       We believe that we can compete effectively with our competitors on the basis of the following factors: (i) the strength and reputation of our brand,
(ii) our ability to provide creative and quality PUGV, (iii) the demographic composition and engagement of our user base, (iv) the vibrant and inclusive
community culture, (v) the performance and reliability of our platform, and (vi) our ability to develop new products and services and enhancements to
existing products and services to keep up with user preferences and demands.

      Most of the players in the video-based industry are focused on one or two video content formats as their primary ways of engaging with users and
deriving revenues. We do not view our value proposition to users, business model or our revenue streams as directly comparable with other market
players, because we operate a unique business model of operating a full-spectrum video community that offers comprehensive content offerings across
short and mid-to-long form videos, PUGV, live broadcasting, OGV, mobile games and others, all on one integrated platform. This commercialization
model differentiates us from other vertical-focused video streaming companies, mobile game companies, live broadcasting companies or e-commerce
companies.

                                                                            89

     As we introduce new products and services on our platform, as our existing products continue to evolve, or as other companies introduce new
products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.


Insurance
      We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate as we have in place all the mandatory insurance policies required by Chinese laws and
regulations and in accordance with the commercial practices in our industry. Our employee-related insurance consists of pension insurance, maternity
insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing funds, as required by Chinese laws and regulations.
We also purchase supplemental commercial health insurance and accident insurance for our employees.

       In line with general market practice, we do not maintain insurance policies covering damages to our network infrastructures or information
technology systems. We also do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain product
liability insurance or key-man insurance.

State and the National People’s Congress of the PRC promulgated the Decision of the First Session of the Thirteenth National People’s Congress on the
State Council Institutional Reform Proposal, collectively, the Institutional Reform Plans. According to the Institutional Reform Plans, effective from

China. The National Press and Publication Administration at the national level suspended approval of game registration and issuance of publication
numbers for online games since March 2018 and resumed to issue game publication numbers by batches periodically since December 2018, according to
certain news reports. Beginning in December 2018, the National Press and Publication Administration at the national level started to approve new online

Publication Administration promulgated the Administrative Measures for Internet Games (Draft for Comment), which provide that the national
publishing regulatory authority oversees online game publishing activities nationwide while local authorities at county level and above are responsible

Anti-addiction System and Protection of Minors
       In March 2007, the GAPP and several other government agencies issued a circular requiring the implementation of an anti-fatigue system and a
real-name registration system by all PRC online game operators to curb addictive online game playing by minors. To identify whether a game player is a
minor and thus subject to the anti-fatigue system, a real-name registration system must be adopted to require online game players to register with their
real identity information before playing online games. The online game operators are also required to submit the identity information of game players to
the public security authority for verification.

      In July 2011, the GAPP, together with several other government agencies, jointly issued the Notice on Initializing the Verification of Real-name
Registration for the Anti-Fatigue System on Online Games, or the Real-name Registration Notice, in order to strengthen the implementation of the anti-
fatigue and real-name registration system. This notice indicates that the National Citizen Identity Information Center of the Ministry of Public Security
will verify identity information of game players submitted by online game operators. The Real-name Registration Notice also imposes stringent
penalties on online game operators that do not implement the required anti-fatigue and real-name registration systems properly and effectively, including
terminating their online game operations.

      In 2011, the Ministry of Culture of the PRC, together with several other government agencies, jointly issued a Circular on Printing and
Distributing Implementation Scheme regarding Parental Guardianship Project for Minors Playing Online Games to strengthen the administration of
online games and protect the legitimate rights and interests of minors.

      This circular indicates that online game operators must have person in charge, set up specific service webpages and publish specific hotlines to
provide parents with necessary assistance to prevent or restrict minors’ improper game playing behavior.

       On October 25, 2019, the National Press and Publication Administration issued the Notice on Preventing Minors from Indulging in Online Games

requirements above shall be requisite for launching, publishing and operating online games; and (v) the development and implementation of an
age-appropriate reminding system shall be explored. Online game companies shall analyze the cause of minors’ addiction to games, and alter the content
and features of games or game rules resulting in such addiction.

       On October 17, 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress revised and promulgated the Law of the PRC on the Protection
of Minors (2020 Revision), which took effect on June 1, 2021. Law of the PRC on the Protection of Minors (2020 Revision) added a new section
entitled “Online Protections” which stipulates a series of provisions to further protect minors’ interests on the internet, among others, (i) online product
and service providers are prohibited from providing minors with products and services that would induce minors to indulge, (ii) online service providers
for products and services such as online games, live broadcasting, audio-video, and social networking are required to establish special management
systems of user duration, access authority and consumption for minors, (iii) online games service providers must request minors to register and log into
online games with their valid identity information, (iv) online games service providers must categorize games according to relevant rules and standards,

games functions, and (v) online games service providers may not provide online games services to minors from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. the next day. As

accordance with the relevant supervision requirements. These two systems include, among others, following measures:
      (i)    the real-name registration system requires users to register with valid identity information and the users without real-name authentication
             will not be able to log into the game after 1 hour’s trial playing in visitor experience mode for 15 days;

                                                                             97

      On August 30, 2021, the National Press and Publication Administration promulgated the Notice on Further Strict Management to Effectively
Prevent Minors from Being Addicted to Online Games, which became effective on September 1, 2021. The notice requires that all online games

p.m. each day on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays, and may not provide online game services to minors in any form at any other time.
All online games must be connected to the real-name verification system of the National Press and Publication Administration for online games to
prevent addiction, all online game users must use real and valid identity information to register their game accounts and log in to online games, and
online games enterprises must not provide online game services in any form (including visitor experience mode) to users who have not registered and
logged in with their real names.

      In October 2023, the State Council promulgated the Regulation on the Protection of Minors in Cyberspace, which took effect on January 1, 2024.
This regulation enhances oversight of online content, safeguards minors’ personal information, and addresses the prevention and management of
minors’ internet addiction. It also reinforces the responsibilities and duties of online platform service providers catering to a significant number of minor
users or impacting minors extensively. This includes fully considering the physical and mental developmental needs of minors throughout all stages of
internet platform services, such as in design, research and development, and operations, conducting regular evaluations of the impact of minors’ online
protection, and offering “teen mode” or designated areas for minors to access products or services that contribute to their physical and mental well-
being. Additionally, it mandates the establishment of an external-dominant independent body to supervise the protection of minors on the internet.

        In December 2023, the National Press and Publication Administration issued the Administrative Measures for Internet Games (Draft for
Comment), which provided detailed regulations for the protection of minors in online gaming operations. These rules include, but are not limited to:
(i) strict control over the duration and time minors spend playing online games, (ii) prohibition of minors from accessing games that may easily lead to

December 11, 2023 and became effective from January 20, 2024. According to the Patent Law of the PRC and its implementing regulations, the State
Intellectual Property Office of the PRC is primarily responsible for administering patents in the PRC. The patent administration departments of
provincial or autonomous regions or municipal governments are responsible for administering patents within their respective jurisdictions. The Chinese
patent system adopts a “first come, first file” principle, which means that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a
patent will be granted to the person who files the application first. To be patentable, invention or utility models must meet three criteria: novelty,
inventiveness and practicability. A third-party player must obtain consent or a proper license from the patent owner to use the patent. Otherwise, the use
constitutes an infringement of the patent rights.

August 24, 2017, and became effective on November 1, 2017, regulates the “.CN” and the “zhongguo (in Chinese character)” shall be China’s national
top-level domains. Any party that engages in internet information services shall use its domain name in compliance with laws and regulations and in line
with relevant provisions of the telecommunications authority, but shall not use its domain name to commit any illegal act.


Regulations Related to Anti-Unfair Competition and Anti-Monopoly
      According to the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC, which was adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on
September 2, 1993, became effective as of December 1, 1993, and last amended on April 23, 2019, unfair competition refers to that the operator disrupts
the market competition order and damages the legitimate rights and interests of other operators or consumers in violation of the provisions of the Anti-
unfair Competition Law in the production and operating activities. Pursuant to the Anti-unfair Competition Law, operators shall abide by the principle of
voluntariness, equality, impartiality, integrity and adhere to laws and business ethics during market transactions. Operators in violation of the Anti-unfair
Competition Law shall bear corresponding civil, administrative or criminal liabilities depending on the specific circumstances.

       In March 2022, the Supreme People’s Court issued the Interpretation of the Supreme People’s Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application
of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC which became effective on March 20, 2022. The interpretation focuses on detailing Article 2 of the
Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC, including counterfeiting and confusion, false publicity and online unfair competition.

      In November 2022, the SAMR issued the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC (Draft Revisions for Comments). The draft’s provisions
include, but are not limited to, improving the anti-unfair competition rules of the digital economy, regulating and controlling behaviors that disrupt the
order of competition in the development of new economies, new formats and new models, improving commercial confusion clauses and false publicity
clauses, setting corresponding penalties for new illegal acts such as harming fair trade, carrying out malicious transactions, and new types of online
unfair competition, and adjusting the penalty amount for illegal acts. As of the date of this annual report, such draft has not been formally adopted.

       The Anti-monopoly Law of the PRC promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, which became effective on
August 1, 2008 and latest amended on June 24, 2022, and the Provisions of the State Council on the Thresholds for Declaring Concentration of Business
Operators, promulgated by the State Council on August 3, 2008 and last amended on January 22, 2024, require that where a concentration reaches one
of the following thresholds, a declaration must be lodged in advance with the anti-monopoly law enforcement agency under the State Council, or
otherwise the concentration shall not be implemented: (i) during the previous fiscal year, the total global turnover of all undertakings participating in the
concentration exceeded RMB12 billion, and at least two of these undertakings each had a turnover of more than RMB800 million within China; or
(ii) during the previous fiscal year, the total turnover within China of all the undertakings participating in the concentration exceeded RMB4 billion, and
at least two of these undertakings each had a turnover of more than RMB800 million within China. Where a concentration of business operators does
not satisfy the threshold for declaration as prescribed, but there is evidence proving that the concentration has or may have the effect of eliminating or
restricting competition, the anti-monopoly law enforcement authorities of the State Council may request the business operators to declare the
concentration. On June 24, 2022, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted the amendment on Anti-monopoly Law, which
introduced a “safe harbor” for anti-competitive agreements that have a market share lower than a specific threshold to be set by SAMR, granted SAMR
the power to suspend the review period in merger investigations under specified circumstances, allowed public prosecutors to bring a civil public
interest lawsuit based on monopolistic behaviors, and significantly increased the penalties for violation of anti-monopoly law. This amendment
emphasized the enforcement of anti-monopoly laws in internet, finance and other key industries.

                                                                            110

       On March 10, 2023, the SAMR issued the Provisions on Examination and Approval of Concentration of Business Operators, which became
effective on April 15, 2023. According to these provisions, concentration refers to (i) a merger of undertakings; (ii) acquiring control over other
undertakings by virtue of acquiring equities or assets; or (iii) acquisition of control over, or being able to exercise decisive influence on, an undertaking
by contract or by any other means.

       In February 2021, the Anti-monopoly Commission of the State Council published the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform
Economy Sector, which provides that the calculation of turnover in the field of platform economy may be different depending on the business model of
the operators: for platform operators who only provide information matchings and collect commissions, their turnovers should be calculated including
the service fee charged by the platform and other platform income; for the platform operators who participate in the market competition on the platform
side, their turnovers shall be calculated including the transaction amount involved in the platform and other platforms. The concentration of
undertakings involving the agreement control (VIE) structure falls within the scope of the antitrust review of concentration of undertakings. Where the
concentration of undertakings meets the declaration standards set by the State Council, the operators shall declare to the anti-monopoly law enforcement
agency of the State Council in advance, and the concentration shall not be implemented if the concentration is not declared. According to the currently
effective Anti-Monopoly Law of the PRC, if business operators fail to comply with the mandatory declaration requirement, the anti-monopoly authority
is empowered to order to terminate and/or unwind the transaction, dispose of relevant assets, shares or businesses within certain periods, adopt other
necessary measures to reinstate the pre-concentration status and impose fines of up to 10% of the previous year’s sales volume where such concentration
has or may have the effect of excluding or restricting competition, or a fine of up to RMB5,000,000 where such concentration does not have the effect of
excluding or restricting competition.

time limit.

                                                                             111

Regulations Related to Taxation
Enterprise Income Tax
       According to the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which was promulgated on March 16, 2007, came into effect on January 1, 2008, and last amended
on December 29, 2018, and the Implementation Regulations on the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which was promulgated by the State Council on
December 6, 2007, came into effect on January 1, 2008, amended by the State Council on April 23, 2019, and came into effect on the same date, a
uniform income tax rate of 25% will be applied to resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises that have established production and operation
facilities in China. Besides enterprises established within the PRC, enterprises established in accordance with the laws of other judicial districts whose
“de facto management bodies” are within the PRC are considered “resident enterprises” and subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate for
their global income. A non-resident enterprise refers to an entity established under foreign law whose “de facto management bodies” are not within the
PRC but which have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but have
income sourced within the PRC. An income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to or any other gains realized on the
transfer of shares by non-PRC resident enterprise investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such
establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such
dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.

       According to the Arrangement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion between the mainland of China and Hong Kong entered
into between the mainland of China and the HKSAR on August 21, 2006, if the non-PRC parent company of a PRC enterprise is a Hong Kong resident
which directly owns 25% or more of the equity interest of the PRC foreign-invested enterprise which pays the dividends and interests, the 10%
withholding tax rate applicable under the Enterprise Income Tax Law may be lowered to 5% for dividends and 7% for interest payments if a Hong Kong
resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax
Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws. However, according to the Notice on the Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of
Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, which was promulgated by the State Tax Administration on February 20, 2009, and came into effect on the same
date, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits unjustifiably from such reduced income tax rate due to a
transaction or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment; and based on the
Announcement of the Certain Issues with Respect to the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, issued by the State Tax Administration on February 3,
2018, and effective on April 1, 2018, if an applicant’s business activities do not constitute substantive business activities, it could result in the negative
determination of the applicant’s status as a “beneficial owner,” and consequently, the applicant could be precluded from enjoying the above-mentioned
reduced income tax rate of 5% under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement.


VAT
      The Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax, which was promulgated on December 13, 1993, came into effect on January 1, 1994, last
amended on November 19, 2017, and the Detailed Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax, which was promulgated on
December 18, 2008, and amended on October 28, 2011, came into effect on November 1, 2011, set out that all taxpayers selling goods or providing
processing, repairing or replacement labor services, sales of services, intangible assets and immovable assets and importing goods in China shall pay a
value-added tax.

      The State Council approved, and the State Tax Administration and the Ministry of Finance officially launched a pilot value-added tax reform
program starting from January 1, 2012, applicable to businesses in selected industries. Businesses in this pilot program would pay value-added tax
instead of business tax. This pilot program was initiated in Shanghai, then further applied to 10 additional regions such as Beijing and Guangdong
province. On November 19, 2017, the State Council promulgated the Decisions on Abolishing the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Business Tax
and Amending the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax, according to which, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of
goods, the provision of processing, repairing and replacement labor services, sales of services, intangible assets, real property and the importation of
goods within the territory of the PRC are the taxpayers of value-added tax. The value-added tax rates generally applicable are simplified as 17%, 11%,
6% and 0%, and the value-added tax rate applicable to the small-scale taxpayers is 3%. According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the State
Tax Administration on Adjusting Value-added Tax Rates, issued on April 4, 2018, and became effective on May 1, 2018, the deduction rates of 17% and
11% applicable to the taxpayers who have value-added tax taxable sales activities or imported goods are adjusted to 16% and 10%, respectively.
According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration and the General Administration of Customs on Relevant Policies for
Deepening Value Added Tax Reform, issued on March 20, 2019, and became effective on April 1, 2019, the value added tax rate was reduced to 13%
and 9%, respectively.

                                                                             112

Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange Control
      The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Regulation on the Foreign Exchange Control of the PRC,
promulgated by the State Council on January 29, 1996, came into effect on April 1, 1996, and last amended on August 5, 2008, and the Regulations on
the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement, Sale and Payment, promulgated by the People’s Bank of China in June 1996 and came into effect

trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans and investments in securities
outside of the PRC, unless the prior approval or record-filing of the SAFE or its local counterpart is obtained.

      The SAFE Circular 19, promulgated on March 30, 2015, came into effective on June 1, 2015, and last amended on December 30, 2019, allows
foreign-invested enterprises to make equity investments by using RMB fund converted from foreign exchange capital. Under the SAFE Circular 19, the
foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises upon the confirmation of rights and interests of monetary contribution by
the local foreign exchange bureau (or the book-entry registration of monetary contribution by the banks) can be settled at the banks based on the actual
operation needs of the enterprises. The proportion of willingness-based foreign exchange settlement of capital for foreign-invested enterprises is
temporarily set at 100%. The SAFE can adjust such proportion in due time based on the circumstances of the international balance of payments.
However, SAFE Circular 19 and the Circular on Reforming and Regulating the Management Policies on the Settlement of Capital Projects, promulgated
on June 9, 2016, continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange
capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, investing and financing directly or indirectly in securities and other investments except for bank’s
principal-secured products, providing loans to non-affiliated enterprises or constructing or purchasing real estate not for self-use.

       On October 23, 2019, the SAFE released the Circular 28, according to which besides foreign-invested enterprises engaged in investment business,
non-investment foreign-invested enterprises are also permitted to make domestic equity investments with their capital funds in foreign currency
provided that such investments do not violate the Negative List (2021) and the target investment projects are genuine and in compliance with laws.
According to the Circular on Optimizing Administration of Foreign Exchange to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business, issued by the
SAFE on April 10, 2020, eligible enterprises are allowed to make domestic payments by using their capital funds, foreign credits and the income under
capital accounts of overseas listing, without submitting the evidentiary materials concerning authenticity of such capital for banks in advance; provided
that their capital use is authentic and in compliance with administrative regulations on the use of income under capital accounts. The bank in charge
shall conduct post spot checking in accordance with the relevant requirements.

       According to the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive
Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies, which was promulgated by SAFE in February 2012, PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens residing in China
for a continuous period of not less than one year (except for foreign diplomatic personnel in China and representatives of international organizations in
China) who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company shall, through the domestic company to which the said
company is affiliated, collectively entrust a domestic agency (may be the Chinese affiliate of the overseas publicly listed company which participates in
stock incentive plan, or other domestic institutions qualified for asset trust business lawfully designated by such company) to handle foreign exchange
registration, and entrust an overseas institution to handle issues like exercise of options, purchase and sale of corresponding stocks or equity and transfer
of corresponding funds. In addition, the domestic agency is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is
any material change to the stock incentive plan.

                                                                            113

       The SAFE Circular 37, promulgated by the SAFE on July 4, 2014, and came into effective on the same date, states that (i) a PRC resident,
including a PRC resident natural person or a PRC legal person, shall register with the local branch of the SAFE before it contributes its assets or equity
interest in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests into a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of investment and financing; and (ii) when
the special purpose vehicle undergoes change of basic information, such as change in PRC resident natural person shareholder, name or operating
period, or occurrence of a material event, such as change in share capital of a PRC resident natural person, performance of merger or split, the PRC
resident shall register such change with the local branch of the SAFE in a timely manner. According to the SAFE Circular 13 which was promulgated by
SAFE on February 13, 2015, came effective on June 1, 2015, and amended on December 30, 2019, banks are required to review and carry out foreign
exchange registration under offshore direct investment directly. The SAFE and its branches shall implement indirect supervision over foreign exchange
registration of direct investment via the banks.


Regulations Related to Dividend Distributions
       The principal laws and regulations regulating the dividend distribution of dividends by foreign-invested enterprises in China include the PRC
Company Law, last amended in 2023 and to be effective in July 2024 and the Foreign Investment Law. Under the current regulatory regime in the PRC,
foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting
standards and regulations. A PRC company, including foreign-invested enterprise, is required to set aside as general reserves at least 10% of its after-tax
profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its registered capital unless the provisions of laws regarding foreign investment
otherwise provided, and shall not distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years
may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.


Regulations Related to M&A and Overseas Listings
       The M&A Rules was jointly promulgated by six PRC governmental authorities including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Tax
Administration, the SAFE, the SAMR, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council and the CSRC on
August 8, 2006 and amended on June 22, 2009. Foreign investors must comply with the M&A Rules when they purchase equity interests of a domestic
company or subscribe the increased capital of a domestic company, and thus changing of the nature of the domestic company into a foreign-invested
enterprise; or when the foreign investors establish a foreign-invested enterprise in mainland China, purchase the assets of a domestic company and
operate the asset; or when the foreign investors purchase the assets of a domestic company by agreement, establish a foreign-invested enterprise by
injecting such assets, and operate the assets. According to Article 11 of the M&A Rules, where a domestic enterprise, or a domestic natural person,
through an overseas company established or controlled by it/him/her, acquires a domestic enterprise which is related to or connected with it/him/her,
approval from the Ministry of Commerce is required. The M&A Rules, among other things, further purport to require that an offshore special purpose
vehicle, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals, shall obtain the approval of the CSRC prior
to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle acquires shares of or equity interests in the PRC companies in exchange for the shares of
offshore companies.

       On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies
and five supporting guidelines, effective March 31, 2023. On May 26, 2023, the CSRC promulgated another supporting guideline, which came into
effect on the same date. These measures establish a new filing-based regime to regulate overseas offerings and listings by domestic companies. Under
these measures, the overseas offering and listing by a domestic company, whether directly or indirectly, shall be filed with the CSRC. The overseas
offering or listing shall be considered as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a domestic enterprise, if the issuer meets both of the following

more than 50% of the relevant line item in the issuer’s audited consolidated financial statement for that year; and (ii) the business operation is mainly
carried out in the PRC or the main places of business are located in the PRC, or senior management personnel responsible for business operations and

to national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance with law; (iii) if, in the past three years,
the domestic enterprise or its controlling shareholders or actual controllers have committed corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of
property, or other criminal offenses disruptive to the order of the socialist market economy; (iv) if the domestic enterprise is under investigation
according to law for suspected crimes or major violations of laws and regulations, but no clear conclusions have been reached; or (v) if there are

Listing by Domestic Companies and issued the Notice on Administration for the Filing of Overseas Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies,
which clarifies that the domestic companies that have already been listed overseas before March 31, 2023 shall be deemed as the existing applicants who
are not required to complete the filing procedures immediately but shall be required to file with the CSRC when subsequent matters such as refinancing
are involved. Furthermore, for the overseas listing of companies with VIE contractual arrangements, the CSRC will solicit opinions from relevant
regulatory authorities and complete the filing of the overseas listing of companies with these domestic companies which meet their compliance
requirements and support their development and growth by enabling them to utilize both markets and their resources. Nevertheless, it does not specify
what qualify as a compliant VIE structure and what relevant domestic laws and regulations are required to be complied with.

       Violation of the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies may result in (i) an order
requiring the associated mainland China enterprise to correct the violations, a warning and a fine of RMB1 million to RMB10 million imposed on this
entity; (ii) a warning and a fine of RMB500,000 to RMB5,000,000 imposed on the directly responsible supervisors and other directly responsible
person(s); and (iii) if the controlling shareholder or the actual controller of the associated mainland China enterprise organized or incited the violations,
such person may face a fine of RMB1 million to RMB10 million, and the directly responsible supervisors and other directly responsible person(s) may
face a fine of RMB500,000 to RMB5,000,000.

       On February 24, 2023, the CSRC and other relevant government authorities promulgated the Provision on Confidentiality of Overseas Securities
Issuance and Listing which became effective on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Provision on Confidentiality of Overseas Securities Issuance and
Listing, where a domestic enterprise provides or publicly discloses to the relevant securities companies, securities service institutions, overseas
regulatory authorities and other entities and individuals, or provides or publicly discloses through its overseas listing subjects, documents and materials
involving state secrets and working secrets of state organs, it shall report the same to the competent department with the examination and approval
authority for approval in accordance with the law, and submit the same to the secrecy administration department of the same level for filing. Domestic
enterprises providing accounting archives or copies thereof to entities and individuals concerned such as securities companies, securities service
institutions and overseas regulatory authorities shall perform the corresponding procedures pursuant to the relevant provisions of the State. The working
papers formed within the territory of the PRC by the securities companies and securities service institutions that provide corresponding services for the
overseas issuance and listing of domestic enterprises shall be kept within the territory of the PRC, and those that need to leave the PRC shall go through
the examination and approval formalities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the State.

                                                                             115

Contractual Arrangements with the Relevant VIEs and their Respective Individual Shareholders
Reasons for Adopting the Contractual Arrangements
      PRC laws and regulations restrict and impose conditions on foreign ownership and investment in certain internet-based businesses.

                                                                            116
Table of Contents

      Certain consolidated affiliated entities with which we have contractual arrangements and their subsidiaries, namely, Shanghai Kuanyu, Hode
Information Technology, Shanghai Hehehe Culture Communication Co., Ltd., Sharejoy Network Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Anime Tamashi
Cultural Media Co., Ltd., currently operate the following businesses: (i) internet audio-visual program services, (ii) radio and television program
production and operation business, and (iii) internet cultural business. PRC laws and regulations prohibit direct foreign investment in operating
companies in these sectors. Certain consolidated affiliated entities with which we have contractual arrangements and their subsidiaries, namely,
Shanghai Kuanyu, Hode Information Technology, Sharejoy Network Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Hehehe Culture Communication Co., Ltd.,
currently operate the internet information services. PRC laws and regulations restrict direct foreign investment in operating companies in this sector.

       Since foreign investment in these businesses in which the VIEs currently operate are subject to the restrictions under the current PRC laws and
regulations, as advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, we determined that it was not viable for our company to hold the consolidated
affiliated entities or their subsidiaries that are operating these businesses directly through equity ownership. Instead, we decided that, in line with
common practice in industries in the PRC subject to foreign investment restrictions, we would gain effective control over, and have the right to receive
all the economic benefits generated by the Relevant Businesses which are currently operated by these entities through contractual arrangements. We
believe that these contractual arrangements are fair and reasonable because: (i) they were freely negotiated and entered into by the contracting parties;
(ii) by entering into the exclusive business cooperation agreements, the VIEs will enjoy better economic and technical support from us and better market
reputation; and (iii) a number of other companies use similar arrangements to accomplish the same purpose.

       The following is a summary of the currently effective contractual arrangements (i) by and among our wholly owned subsidiary, Hode Shanghai,
the principal VIEs and their respective shareholders, and (ii) by and among Chaodian Technology, Chaodian Culture and the individual shareholders of
Chaodian Culture. These contractual arrangements enable us to (i) exercise effective control over the relevant VIEs; (ii) receive substantially all of the
economic benefits of the relevant VIEs; and (iii) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in and assets of them when and to
the extent permitted by PRC law.


Agreements that provide us effective control over the relevant VIEs
Powers of Attorney
       Mr. Rui Chen executed a power of attorney on August 24, 2021, pursuant to which Mr. Rui Chen irrevocably appoints Hode Shanghai or its
designated person (including, but not limited to, directors and their successors and liquidators replacing the directors but excluding those
non-independent or who may give rise to conflict of interests) as his attorney-in-fact to exercise such shareholder’s rights in Shanghai Kuanyu,
including, without limitation, to, the rights to (i) convene and participate in shareholders’ meeting pursuant to the articles of Shanghai Kuanyu in the
capacity of a proxy of Mr. Rui Chen; (ii) exercise the voting rights pursuant to the relevant PRC laws and regulations and the articles of Shanghai
Kuanyu, on behalf of Mr. Rui Chen, and adopt resolutions, on matters to be discussed and resolved at shareholders’ meetings and the appointment and

Kuanyu; (iii) sign or submit any required document to any company registry or other authorities in the capacity of a proxy of Mr. Rui Chen; and (iv) to

share transfer agreement, asset transfer agreement and board resolutions when Mr. Rui Chen exercises his right to transfer his equity in Shanghai
Kuanyu in accordance with exclusive option agreement; and (vii) to instruct the directors and senior officers to act in accordance with our attention.

     Mr. Rui Chen has undertaken that he will refrain from any action or omission that may cause any conflict of interest between himself and Hode
Shanghai or its shareholders.

                                                                            117

is unilaterally terminated by Hode Shanghai; or (ii) it is legally permissible for Hode Shanghai, Bilibili or any of its subsidiaries to hold equity interests
directly or indirectly in Shanghai Kuanyu and Hode Shanghai or its designated person is registered to be the sole shareholder of Shanghai Kuanyu.

Equity Pledge Agreements
      Hode Shanghai, Shanghai Kuanyu and Mr. Rui Chen entered into an equity pledge agreement on August 24, 2021, pursuant to which Mr. Rui
Chen agreed to pledge all of his equity interests in Shanghai Kuanyu to Hode Shanghai as a security interest to guarantee the performance of contractual
obligations and the payment of outstanding debts under the Contractual Arrangements.

have been made to protect Hode Shanghai’s interests in the event of death, restricted capacity or incapacity, divorce of Mr. Rui Chen or any other event
which causes his inability to exercise his rights as a shareholder of Shanghai Kuanyu to avoid any practical difficulties in enforcing the equity pledge
agreement and shall procure or use its reasonable efforts to procure any successors of Mr. Rui Chen to comply with the same undertakings as if they
were parties to the equity pledge agreement. If Shanghai Kuanyu declares any dividend during the term of the pledge, Hode Shanghai is entitled to
receive all such dividends, bonus issue or other income arising from the pledged equity interests, if any. If Mr. Rui Chen or Shanghai Kuanyu breaches
or fails to fulfill the obligations under any of the aforementioned agreements, Hode Shanghai, as the pledgee, will be entitled to escrow of the pledged
equity interests, entirely or partially. In addition, pursuant to the equity pledge agreement, Mr. Rui Chen has undertaken to Hode Shanghai, among other
things, not to transfer his equity interests in Shanghai Kuanyu and not to create or allow any pledge thereon that may affect the rights and interest of
Hode Shanghai without its prior written consent.

        The equity pledge under the equity pledge agreement takes effect upon the completion of registration with the relevant local branch of the SAMR
and shall remain valid until (i) all the obligations under the Contractual Arrangements have been fulfilled; (ii) Mr. Rui Chen has transferred all of his
equity interests in Shanghai Kuanyu in accordance with the exclusive option agreement and Hode Shanghai can legally conduct the businesses held by
Shanghai Kuanyu; (iii) Shanghai Kuanyu has transferred all of its assets in accordance with the exclusive option agreement and Hode Shanghai can

      On December 23, 2020, Hode Shanghai, Hode Information Technology and each of the shareholders of Hode Information Technology entered into
an exclusive option agreement, which contains terms substantially similar to the exclusive option agreement described above.

      On September 30, 2020, Chaodian Technology, Chaodian Culture and each of the individual shareholders of Hode Chaodian Culture entered into
an exclusive option agreement, which contains terms substantially similar to the exclusive option agreement described above.

       We have also entered into contractual arrangements with several other affiliated entities and their respective nominee shareholders through some
of our subsidiaries other than Hode Shanghai or Chaodian Technology, which result in our company or relevant subsidiaries, as the case may be, being
the primary beneficiaries of the relevant affiliated entities. As a result of these contractual arrangements, there exists a parent-subsidiary relationship
between us and the relevant affiliated entities, and we consolidate these affiliated entities through the subsidiaries.

       However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules.
Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may in the future take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different from the above opinion of our PRC
counsel. If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our online entertainment business do not comply with
PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in our businesses, we could be subject to severe penalties including being prohibited from
continuing operations. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—We rely on contractual
arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders for our operations in mainland China, which may not be as effective in providing operational control
as direct ownership.”; “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—Substantial uncertainties exist with
respect to how the Foreign Investment Law may impact the viability of our current corporate structure and operations.”; and “Item 3. Key Information—
D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—If we fail to obtain and maintain the licenses and approvals required within the complex
regulatory environment applicable to our businesses in mainland China, or if we are required to take compliance actions that are time-consuming or
costly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.”


D. Property, Plants and Equipment
       Our headquarter is located at Wujiaochang commercial district in Shanghai. We lease and occupy office buildings with an aggregate floor area of
approximately 105,000 square meters. A substantial majority of our employees are based at our headquarters in Shanghai. Our servers and network
facilities for internal administrative functions are located at our headquarters. We have sales and marketing, and anime production personnel at our
regional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. We lease and occupy approximately 4,700 square meters of office space in Beijing, approximately 5,600 square
meters of office space in Chengdu and approximately 700 square meters of office space in Tokyo. These leases vary in duration from one to four years.

       In 2020, we established an entity together with two entities each controlled by Mr. Rui Chen and Ms. Ni Li, and an independent third party to
acquire the land use rights for a parcel of land in Shanghai. We hold 30.01% of the shares of this entity. The total investment for the acquisition of land
use rights is approximately RMB9.0 billion. As of the date of this annual report, this entity has obtained the land use rights and we have paid
RMB2.8 billion to fund the acquisition of land use rights, including interest-bearing guaranteed loans of RMB1.3 billion in principal. In 2023, this entity
repaid RMB636.4 million in principal and RMB60.2 million in interest on the loans. For a detailed description of these loans, see “Item 7. Major
Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related Party Transactions—Other Related Party Transactions.” Construction of certain buildings on
this parcel of land has commenced and is expected to complete by approximately 2026. We may use space in one of the buildings as our office space
following the completion of this construction project.

       As of the date of this annual report, some of our leased properties are subject to mortgage, and we have not registered any of our lease agreements
with the relevant government authorities due to the lack of cooperation from our landlords in registering the relevant lease agreements. The failure to
register the lease agreements for our leased properties will not affect the validity of these lease agreements, but the competent housing authorities may
order us to register the lease agreements in a prescribed period of time and impose a fine ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB10,000 for each
non-registered lease agreement if we fail to complete the registration within the prescribed timeframe. As of the date of this annual report, we have not
received any notification from any competent authority in the PRC in relation to the non-registration of lease agreements.

                                                                            122

                                                                                      For the Three Months Ended

Average DAUs(1)(3)                              79.4       83.5             90.3            92.8         93.7        96.5            102.8           100.1

Note:
(1)     Average DAU is calculated by dividing the sum of DAU during the specified period by the number of days in such period.
(2)     Average MAU is calculated by dividing the sum of MAU during the specified period by the number of months in such period.
(3)     Starting from the second quarter of 2022, we count our active users as the sum of active users on mobile apps and on PC during a given period.
        We calculate active users on mobile apps based on the number of mobile devices (including smart TV and other smart devices) that have launched
        our mobile apps during a given period. Active users on PC refer to the sum of valid logged-in users who visit our website at www.bilibili.com on
        PC and who engage in PC application during a given period, after eliminating duplicates.

      Our active users generally view and consume a multitude of content offered on our platform, including videos, live broadcasting, mobile games
and other content. The number of our users and the level of their engagement on our platform affect our revenues. We had solid growth in the revenues
generated from VAS mainly due to the increasing number of active viewers of our live broadcasting and subscribers of our premium membership
program. Our advertising revenue is driven by the size of our user base, the engagement of our users and our brand equity. Mobile game user base
growth and engagement are primarily driven by the launch of new games and the release of updates of our existing games.

      In 2022, we shifted our user growth focus from MAU growth to DAU growth, as we believe DAU is not only a better measure of the quality and
sustainability of our community, but also is directly linked to our commercial prospects. We will continue to implement our strategy to grow our DAU
base and increase penetration in Generation Z+ and attract users from wider demographics. We will continue to support our content creators, enrich
video content, strengthen our brand recognition and invest in high-quality user growth.

                                                                            123

Our provision and commercialization of diversified product and service offerings
     Our revenues and results of operations depend on our ability to convert more users to paying users and to increase their spending on our platform,
which is driven by our provision of diversified product and service offerings appealing to our users.

        The following table sets forth our average monthly paying users, and average monthly revenue per paying user for each of the quarters indicated:

                                                                                    For the Three Months Ended

Note:
(1)     Average monthly paying users is calculated by dividing the sum of monthly paying users during the specified period by the number of months in
        such period. Paying users on our platform refer to users who make payments for various products and services on our platform, including
        purchases in games and payments for VAS (excluding purchases on our e-commerce platform). A user who makes payments across different
        products and services offered on our platform using the same registered account is counted as one paying user and we add the number of paying
        users of Maoer toward our total paying users without eliminating duplicates. Starting from the second quarter of 2022, we add the number of
        paying users of smart TVs toward our total paying users without eliminating duplicates.
(2)     Average monthly revenue per paying user is calculated by dividing the sum of revenues from mobile games and VAS during the specified period
        by the total number of monthly paying users during such period.

       We are striving to refine our commercialization avenues without compromising user experience. We will continue our efforts to enrich our content
library and product offerings, including PUGV, VAS and mobile games, to convert more users to paying users. We plan to launch more high-quality
games to satisfy our users’ evolving needs. We will also continue to develop our VAS to increase the number of our paying users. In addition, we expect
to see increased revenues from advertising, as advertisers across different industries are turning to Bilibili to tap into the coveted Generation Z+
demographic in China. Our revenue growth will be affected by our ability to effectively execute our commercialization strategies and expand our paying
user base.


Our brand recognition and market leadership
      Our brand recognition as a leading video community among the Generation Z+ in China is crucial for us to attract and retain users, content
creators and our business partners, and increase our revenues. We will continue to promote our brand name among broader young generations and
increase our appeal to mass market.


Our ability to manage our costs and expenses
       Our results of operations depend on our ability to manage our costs and expenses. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of revenue-sharing
costs, content costs, server and bandwidth service costs, staff costs and IP derivatives and other costs. We expect our revenue-sharing costs to increase in
absolute amount due to our business expansion in VAS, advertising and mobile games. We are disciplined about our costs and operating expenses and
we will continue to undertake measures to operate more efficiently, including by optimizing resource utilization efficiency to save our server and
bandwidth cost and by controlling our content investment and staff cost. In addition, we will reduce our sales and marketing expense, streamline our
personnel and improve our research and development efficiency. We will adopt a more selective approach to content investment, even though our
content costs may still increase in absolute amount as we continue to produce and procure high quality content for our users.

                                                                            124

Investment in technology and talents
      Our technology is critical for us to better understand our users, improve user experience, maintain a vibrant community, and execute our
commercialization strategy. Our current research and development efforts in technology are primarily focused on enhancing our artificial intelligence
technology, big data analytics capabilities, cloud technology and game development capability, which we believe are crucial for us to develop user
insights so as to provide more relevant and engaging content to our users and to improve our operating efficiency. In addition, there is a strong demand
in China’s internet industry for talented and experienced personnel. We must recruit, retain and motivate talented employees while controlling our
personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses.


Key Components of Results of Operations
Net revenues
      The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues by amounts and percentages of our total net revenues for the periods presented:

       VAS. We primarily generate VAS revenues from (i) sales of in-channel virtual items for use in our live broadcasting so that users can send them to
hosts to show their support, which comprise either consumable items, such as gifts and items that create special visual effects, or time-based items, such
as privileges and titles, and (ii) subscription fees of our premium membership program, which offers paying members benefits including exclusive or
advance access to certain high-quality OGV content. Meanwhile, we also generate revenues from other VAS including sales of paid content and virtual
items on our video, audio and comic platforms. We expect revenues from VAS to continue to grow in the foreseeable future, driven by the further
expansion of our live broadcasting content.

      Advertising. We generate advertising revenues primarily from brand, performance-based, and native advertisements. Brand advertisements
primarily appear on the app opening page, the top banner, the website home page banner and the inline video feed alongside organic feeds. Brand
advertisements can also be customized according to advertisers’ needs and appear in Bilibili-produced OGV or events. Performance-based
advertisements appear in various formats, such as video or picture feeds alongside organic feeds, a banner underneath the video-playing frame, a link,
banner or pop-up in the Story Mode, and a link in the comment section appearing below our videos. Native advertisings are customized according to
advertisers’ needs, produced by our content creators and embedded naturally in their video creations. We expect our advertising revenues to increase in
the foreseeable future as we continue to integrate advertising products into our content ecosystem, improve our advertising infrastructure, and attract
more advertisers by optimizing advertising procurement processes.

       Mobile games. We primarily offer exclusively distributed mobile games and jointly operated mobile games developed by third-party game
developers. For exclusively distributed mobile games, we are responsible for game launch, hosting and maintenance of game servers, game promotions
and customer services. We also develop localized versions for games licensed from overseas developers. For jointly operated mobile game services, we
provide our mobile game platform for mobile games developed by third-party developers. We earn game distribution service revenue within the
applicable contract periods by providing payment solutions and game promotion services, while game developers are responsible for providing game
products, hosting and maintaining game servers and determining the pricing of in-game virtual items. As of December 31, 2023, we operated multiple
exclusively distributed mobile games and hundreds of jointly operated mobile games. Our revenues from mobile games depend on the number of paying
users, and ultimately are determined by our ability to develop, select, procure and offer engaging games tailored to our platform and our user
preferences. We expect revenues from mobile games to fluctuate but remain as an important stream of revenues. At the same time, we expect greater
contribution by revenues from other streams of business as we take initiatives to grow our other revenue streams.

                                                                           125

      IP derivatives and others (formerly known as E-commerce and others). Our IP derivatives and others (formerly known as E-commerce and others)
primarily consist of sales of derivative merchandise of ACG IPs on our e-commerce platform and e-sports copyright sub-licensing. We expect revenues
from IP derivatives and others to fluctuate in the foreseeable future but remain as a meaningful stream of revenues.

hosts of our live broadcasting and content creators in accordance with our revenue-sharing arrangements. Content costs mainly consist of amortized
costs of purchased licensed content from copyright owners or content distributors and our production costs. Server and bandwidth costs are the fees we
pay to telecommunication carriers and other service providers for telecommunication services, hosting our servers at their internet data centers, and

      Our net revenues increased by 2.9% from RMB21.9 billion in 2022 to RMB22.5 billion (US$3.2 billion) in 2023.

     VAS. Our net revenues from VAS increased by 13.7% from RMB8,715.2 million in 2022 to RMB9,910.1 million (US$1,395.8 million) in 2023,
mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from live broadcasting and other value-added services.

      Advertising. Our net revenues from advertising increased by 26.6% from RMB5,066.2 million in 2022 to RMB6,412.0 million (US$903.1 million)
in 2023, mainly attributable to our improved advertising product offerings and enhanced advertising efficiency.

million) in 2023. The decrease was mainly attributable to fewer new game launches as well as lower revenue contributions from certain existing games,
while revenues from top-performing legacy games, like Azur Lane and Fate/Grand Order, remained relatively stable in 2023.

      IP derivatives and others (formerly known as E-commerce and others). Our net revenues from IP derivatives and others decreased by 29.4% from
RMB3,096.5 million in 2022 to RMB2,184.7 million (US$307.7 million) in 2023, mainly attributable to a decrease in revenues from e-sports copyright
sublicensing and IP derivatives sales.

     Our cost of revenues decreased by 5.3% from RMB18,049.9 million in 2022 to RMB17,086.1 million (US$2,406.5 million) in 2023. The decrease

       Revenue-sharing costs increased by 4.3% from RMB9,115.3 million in 2022 to RMB9,507.5 million (US$1,339.1 million) in 2023, primarily due
to an increase in payments made to hosts of live broadcasting programs and content creators on our platform and an increase in payments made to
distribution channels.

     Content costs decreased by 8.6% from RMB3,496.9 million in 2022 to RMB3,195.6 million (US$450.1 million) in 2023, as we continued to
implement a more selective strategy in content investment while maintaining the quality of content provided to our users.

      Server and bandwidth costs decreased by 15.7% from RMB1,752.9 million in 2022 to RMB1,477.1 million (US$208.0 million) in 2023, primarily
due to improvement in resource utilization efficiency.

                                                                         128

RMB2,905.9 million (US$409.3 million) in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in cost of goods sold associated with our IP derivatives business.


Gross profit

   Sales and marketing expenses.
     Our sales and marketing expenses decreased by 20.4% from RMB4,920.7 million in 2022 to RMB3,916.2 million (US$551.6 million) in 2023.
The decreased was primarily attributable to reduced promotional spending related to user acquisition in 2023.

       Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 15.8% from RMB2,521.1 million in 2022 to RMB2,122.4 million (US$298.9 million) in
2023. The decreased was primarily attributable to the decrease in headcount of general and administrative personnel and allowance for expected credit
loss in 2023.


   Research and development expenses.
      Our research and development expenses decreased by 6.3% from RMB4,765.4 million in 2022 to RMB4,467.5 million (US$629.2 million) in
2023. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in headcount of research and development personnel and fewer expenses associated with the

investments in 2023.

RMB281.1 million and RMB542.5 million (US$76.4 million) in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in time
deposits held in 2023 compared to 2022.

       Interest expense. Interest expense primarily represents interest payment and amortized issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes. We
had interest expense of RMB250.9 million and RMB164.9 million (US$23.2 million) in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease in interest expense related to our December 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and April 2026 Notes from RMB192.6 million in 2022 to
RMB110.2 million (US$15.5 million) in 2023.

                                                                          129

Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021
Net revenues
      Our net revenues increased by 13.0% from RMB19.4 billion in 2021 to RMB21.9 billion in 2022.

     Mobile games. Our net revenues from mobile games decreased by 1.4% from RMB5,090.9 million in 2021 to RMB5,021.3 million in 2022,
primarily due to the lack of popular new exclusively distributed game releases in 2022.

      VAS. Our net revenues from VAS increased by 25.7% from RMB6,934.9 million in 2021 to RMB8,715.2 million in 2022, mainly attributable to
our enhanced monetization efforts, led by increases in the number of paying users for our value-added services including live broadcasting services,
premium membership program and other value-added services.

      Advertising. Our net revenues from advertising increased by 12.0% from RMB4,523.4 million in 2021 to RMB5,066.2 million in 2022. This
increase was primarily attributable to further recognition of Bilibili’s brand name in China’s online advertising market, as well as our improved
advertising efficiency.

      E-commerce and Others. We had RMB2,834.5 million and RMB3,096.5 million of e-commerce and other net revenues in 2021 and 2022,
respectively. The increase was mainly attributable to increased revenue from e-sports copyright sub-licensing.


Cost of revenues
      Our cost of revenues increased by 17.7% from RMB15,340.5 million in 2021 to RMB18,049.9 million in 2022. The increase was mainly due to
higher revenue-sharing costs and content costs.

      Revenue-sharing costs increased by 17.9% from RMB7,733.3 million in 2021 to RMB9,115.3 million in 2022, primarily due to an increase in
payments made to developers of exclusively distributed games, an increase in payments made to hosts of live broadcasting programs and content
creators on our platform, and an increase in payments made to distribution channels.

      Content costs increased by 29.8% from RMB2,694.8 million in 2021 to RMB3,496.9 million in 2022, as we continued to expand and diversify our
content offerings. We self-produced and procured selected anime, documentaries, TV shows, movies and variety shows to enrich our content library.
Our investment in content costs has contributed to the growth in our user base and the number of average monthly paying users for VAS.

       Server and bandwidth costs increased by 11.9% from RMB1,565.9 million in 2021 to RMB1,752.9 million in 2022, primarily due to an increase
in server and bandwidth capacity to keep pace with the expansion of our user base and the increase in active users, so as to support a massive and
continuously increasing volume of data generated and video views on our platform every day.

                                                                         130

Operating expenses
      Our total operating expenses increased by 16.6% from RMB10,472.2 million in 2021 to RMB12,207.2 million in 2022, as general and
administrative expenses and research and development expenses both increased due to severance cost related to organization optimization and
termination expenses of certain game projects, partially offset by the decrease in the sales and marketing expenses.


   Sales and marketing expenses.
     Our sales and marketing expenses decreased by 15.1% from RMB5,794.9 million in 2021 to RMB4,920.7 million in 2022. The decrease was

   Research and development expenses.
      Our research and development expenses increased by 67.8% from RMB2,839.9 million in 2021 to RMB4,765.4 million in 2022, primarily due to
expenses of RMB525.8 million associated with the termination of certain game projects, increases in headcount in research and development personnel
and increased depreciation expenses of servers and equipment.


Loss from operations
   As a result of the foregoing, we incurred loss from operations of RMB8,357.9 million in 2022, compared to loss from operations of
RMB6,429.1 million in 2021.


Other income/(expenses)
      Investment income/(loss), net (including impairments). Net investment income/(loss), net (including impairments) primarily includes return earned

investments. We had net investment loss of RMB194.2 million and RMB532.5 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The increase in loss was
primarily due to the loss of RMB465.6 million related to impairment charges for long-term investments.

     Interest income. Interest income primarily represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. We had interest income of
RMB70.4 million and RMB281.1 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by more time deposits purchased in 2022
compared to 2021.

      Interest expense. Interest expense primarily represents interest payment and amortized issuance costs related to long-term debt. We had interest
expense of RMB155.5 million and RMB250.9 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively, primarily attributable to interest expenses of RMB192.6 million
related to our December 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and April 2026 Notes.

       Debt extinguishment gain. Debt extinguishment gain was nil and RMB1,318.6 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily
attributable to gains resulted from the repurchase of convertible senior notes in 2022.

                                                                          131

Income tax
      We recorded income tax of RMB104.1 million in 2022, compared to RMB95.3 million in 2021.


Net loss
      As a result of the foregoing, we incurred net loss of RMB7,507.7 million in 2022, compared to net loss of RMB6,808.7 million in 2021.


Seasonality
      Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the growth of active users tends to accelerate during school holidays,
such as summer and winter breaks, which typically fall in the middle of the third and first quarters of each year, and slow down at the beginning and
during certain parts of the school year. We usually experience increase in video views and hence the number of active users following the release of
phenomenally popular content. Seasonal fluctuations have not thus far posed material operational and financial challenges to us, as such periods tend to
be brief and predictable, allowing us to re-allocate resources and improve efficiency ahead of time.


Taxation
Cayman Islands
      The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no
taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty.

      There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be
applicable on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. In addition, the Cayman Islands does not impose
withholding tax on dividend payments. No stamp duty is payable in the Cayman Islands on transfers of shares of Cayman Islands companies except
those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not a party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any
payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.


Hong Kong
      The majority of our subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong, such as Hode HK and Bilibili HK Limited, are subject to 16.5% Hong Kong profit
tax on their taxable income generated from operations in Hong Kong. The first HK$2 million of profits earned by one of our subsidiaries incorporated in
Hong Kong could be taxed at half the current tax rate (i.e., 8.25%) while the remaining profits will continue to be taxed at the existing 16.5% tax rate.
Under the Hong Kong tax laws, we are exempted from the Hong Kong income tax on our foreign-derived income. In addition, payments of dividends
from our Hong Kong subsidiaries to us are not subject to any Hong Kong withholding tax.


PRC
      Our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC enterprise income tax on their taxable income in accordance with the relevant PRC income tax laws.
Effective from January 1, 2008, the statutory corporate income tax rate is 25%, except for certain entities eligible for preferential tax rates.

      For example, Hode Information Technology has qualified as a High and New Technology Enterprise, which allowed it to enjoy a 15% preferential
enterprise income tax rate for three years from 2023 to 2025. Shanghai Bilibili Technology Co., Ltd. has previously qualified as a High and New
Technology Enterprise, which allowed it to enjoy a 15% preferential enterprise income tax rate for three years starting from 2021 to 2023, and plans to
renew its qualification as a High and New Technology Enterprise in 2024.

                                                                           132
Table of Contents

      Our other major PRC subsidiaries are subject to enterprise income tax on their taxable income in mainland China at a statutory rate of 25%. The
enterprise income tax is calculated based on the entity’s global income as determined under PRC tax laws and accounting standards.

      We are subject to value-added tax mainly at a rate of 6% for services rendered and value-added tax mainly at a rate of 13% for goods sold,
although the rate varies depending on their categories in different periods. We are subject to surcharges on value-added tax payments in accordance with
PRC law. Our advertising and marketing revenues (valued-added tax included) are subject to culture business construction fee at a rate of 1.5% since
July 1, 2019, valid until December 31, 2024, and were exempted in fiscal year of 2021 as part of the measures taken by the government to ease the
negative impact from COVID-19 pandemic.

       Dividends paid by our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in mainland China to our intermediary holding company in Hong Kong will be subject
to a withholding tax rate of 10%, unless the relevant Hong Kong entity satisfies all the requirements under the Arrangement between mainland China
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on
Income and Capital and receives approval from the relevant tax authority. If our Hong Kong subsidiary satisfies all the requirements under the tax
arrangement and receives approval from the relevant tax authority, then the dividends paid to the Hong Kong subsidiary would be subject to withholding
tax at the standard rate of 5%. Effective from November 1, 2015, the above-mentioned approval requirement has been abolished, but a Hong Kong
entity is still required to file application package with the relevant tax authority, and settle the overdue taxes if the preferential 5% tax rate is denied
based on the subsequent review of the application package by the relevant tax authority. On October 14, 2019, Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to
Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties (SAT Announcement (2019) No. 35) was issued to simplify the procedures for claiming mainland China tax treaty
benefits by non-resident taxpayers. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure—We may rely on
dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends
to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and to pay dividends to our shareholders and ADS holders.”

      If Bilibili, a holding company in the Cayman Islands or any of its subsidiaries outside of mainland China were deemed to be a “resident
enterprise” under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, it would be subject to enterprise income tax on its worldwide income at a rate of 25%. See “Item
3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax
purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.”

       As of December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were RMB7,523.1 million, RMB10,187.4 and
RMB7,241.8 million (US$1,020.0 million), respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand, demand deposits placed with
large reputable banks in the United States and China, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with
original terms of three months or less. We entered into several one-year revolving loan facilities provided by certain financial institutions with an
aggregate principal amount of RMB1,200 million (US$169.4 million) as of December 31, 2023. We have utilized RMB650.0 million (US$91.8 million)
from such facilities as of December 31, 2023.

                                                                            133
Table of Contents

      Our principal sources of liquidity have been the proceeds we received from our public offerings of ordinary shares, offerings of convertible senior
notes and other financing activities in the past three years.
       •     In March and April 2021, in connection with our Hong Kong secondary listing, we issued 28,750,000 Class Z ordinary shares (including
             an aggregate of 3,750,000 Class Z ordinary shares in April 2021 to cover over-allotments), consisting of an international offering of
             28,000,000 Class Z ordinary shares and a Hong Kong public offering of 750,000 Class Z ordinary shares. We raised approximately
             HK$22.9 billion from the global offering, after deducting underwriting expenses and other offering expenses.
       •     In November 2021, we issued the December 2026 Notes, from which we raised US$1,576.6 million after deducting commissions and
             offering expenses.
       •     In January 2023, we completed the offering of 15,344,000 ADSs at US$26.65 per ADS. The amount of net proceeds from this offering
             (after deducting all applicable costs and expenses including but not limited to selling commission) is approximately US$396.9 million
             (RMB2,689.4 million). Shortly thereafter, we completed the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of US$384.8 million (RMB2.6
             billion) of our December 2026 Notes with an aggregate purchase price of US$331.2 million (RMB2.2 billion), which was funded by the
             net proceeds from this ADS offering. We have used the remaining proceeds of this ADS offering in the amount of US$68.8 million to
             replenish our cash reserve.

     As of December 31, 2023, an aggregate principal amount of US$429.3 million, US$0.1 million and US$432.4 million of our April 2026 Notes,
2027 Notes, and December 2026 Notes, respectively, remained outstanding.

      As of the date of this annual report, holders of the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on
April 1, 2024, in the case of the April 2026 Notes, June 15, 2025, in the case of the 2027 Notes, and December 1, 2024, in the case of the December
2026 Notes.

       In addition, each of the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes contains similar provisions concerning the holders’ right to require us to repurchase their
notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as well as similar provisions regarding our ability to redeem the existing notes in case of certain
changes in tax law. The indentures governing the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes define a “fundamental change” to include, among other things:
(i) any person or group gaining control of Bilibili Inc., (ii) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the ordinary shares or ADSs as a result of
which these securities would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets; (iii) the shareholders of Bilibili Inc.
approving any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Bilibili Inc.; (iv) the ADSs (or other common equity or ADSs in respect of common
equity underlying the convertible senior notes) ceasing to be listed on any of the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the
Nasdaq Global Market (or any of their respective successors); or (v) any change in or amendment to the laws, regulations and rules of the PRC resulting
in our company being legally prohibited from operating substantially all of the business operations conducted by our company unable to continue to
derive substantially all of the economic benefits from the business operations conducted by these entities.

      If a fundamental change occurs at any time, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes may require us to
repurchase for cash all or part of their notes in principal amounts of US$1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The fundamental change repurchase price
will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus (except in limited circumstances) accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of December 31, 2023, there was no such event of default or fundamental change.

      If an event of default, as defined under the indentures governing the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes, occurs and is continuing, the trustee by
notice to us may, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes by notice to us and the trustee may, and the trustee at the
written request of such holders shall (subject to being indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its reasonable satisfaction) declare 100% of the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable.

      In the event of a fundamental change, we may also be required to issue additional ADSs or, in the case of the December 2026 Notes, Class Z
ordinary shares in lieu of ADSs if a holder of the December 2026 Notes so elects, upon conversion of the relevant Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes. In
addition, upon conversion of the December 2026 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely ADSs (or Class Z ordinary shares if such holder elects to
receive Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion) to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering
any fractional ADS), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted.

                                                                            134
Table of Contents

       We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash
requirements to fund our operations and other commitments for at least the next 12 months. However, we may enhance our liquidity position or increase
our cash reserve for future investments through additional capital and finance funding. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further
dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that
would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

      As of December 31, 2023, 77.4% of our cash and cash equivalents were held in mainland China, including 24.7% of our cash and cash equivalents
that were held by the VIEs and denominated in Renminbi. Although we consolidate the results of the VIEs and their subsidiaries, we only have access to
the assets or earnings of the VIEs and their subsidiaries through our contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders. See “Item 4.
Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure.” For restrictions and limitations on liquidity and capital resources as a result of our
corporate structure, see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Holding Company Structure.”

      In utilizing the proceeds we receive from our financing activities, we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, establish
new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or acquire offshore entities
with operations in mainland China in offshore transactions. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations.

       We expect that a substantial majority of our future revenues will be denominated in Renminbi. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations,
payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be
made in foreign currencies without prior SAFE approval as long as certain routine procedural requirements are fulfilled. Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries
are allowed to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior SAFE approval by following certain routine procedural requirements. However,
approval from or registration with competent government authorities is required where the Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and
remitted out of mainland China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may at
its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future.


Operating activities
      Net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was RMB266.6 million (US$37.6 million), as compared to net loss of RMB4,811.7 million in
the same period. The difference was primarily due to an increase of RMB341.1 million (US$48.0 million) in accrued liabilities and other payables, a
decrease of RMB342.5 million (US$48.2 million) in prepayments and other assets and a decrease of RMB185.8 million (US$26.2 million) in other
long-term assets, partially offset by an increase of RMB262.2 million (US$36.9 million) in accounts receivable, a decrease of RMB182.2 million
(US$25.7 million) in salary and welfare payable and a decrease of RMB141.6 million (US$19.9 million) in other long-term liabilities. The changes in
working capital were attributable to our business expansion, particularly, diversification of other value-added services offerings and increased
advertising revenues. The principal non-cash items affecting the difference between our net loss and our net cash provided by operating activities in
2023 were RMB2,730.4 million (US$384.6 million) in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets,
RMB1,132.6 million (US$159.5 million) in share-based compensation expenses and RMB354.8 million (US$50.0 million) in termination of certain
game projects.

       Net cash used in operating activities in 2022 was RMB3,911.4 million, as compared to net loss of RMB7,507.7 million in the same period. The
difference was primarily due to a decrease of RMB1,026.3 in accrued liabilities and other payables, an increase of RMB444.3 million in other long-term
assets and an increase of RMB556.2 million in prepayments and other current assets, partially offset by an increase of RMB396.1 million in salary and
welfare payable and an increase of RMB173.9 million in deferred revenue. The changes in working capital were attributable to our business expansion,
particularly, diversification of other value-added services offerings and increased advertising revenues. The principal non-cash items affecting the
difference between our net loss and our net cash used in operating activities in 2022 were RMB3,336.8 million in depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment and intangible assets, RMB1,040.7 million in share-based compensation expenses and RMB525.8 million in termination of
certain game projects.

                                                                           135
Table of Contents

       Net cash used in operating activities in 2021 was RMB2,647.0 million, as compared to net loss of RMB6,808.7 million in the same period. The
difference was primarily due to an increase of RMB429.5 million in accounts receivable and an increase of RMB1,747.7 million in prepayments and
other current assets, partially offset by an increase of RMB494.6 million in deferred revenue, an increase of RMB319.7 million in accrued liabilities and
other payables and an increase of RMB1,056.8 million in accounts payable. The changes in working capital were attributable to our business expansion,
particularly, the expansion of our mobile game operations, diversification of other value-added services offerings and increased advertising revenues,
and the increase in sales and marketing expenses. The principal non-cash items affecting the difference between our net loss and our net cash used in
operating activities in 2021 were RMB2,441.8 million in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, and
RMB999.8 million in share-based compensation expenses.


Investing activities
      Net cash provided by investing activities in 2023 was RMB1,762.1 million (US$248.2 million), primarily due to proceeds from maturities of
short-term investments of RMB16.3 billion (US$2.3 billion) and maturities of time deposits of RMB9.7 billion (US$1.4 billion), partially offset by
purchase of short-term investments of RMB13.5 billion (US$1.9 billion) and placements of time deposits of RMB10.0 billion (US$1.4 billion).

      Net cash provided by investing activities in 2022 was RMB10,609.2 million, primarily due to proceeds from maturities of short-term investments
of RMB81.7 billion and maturity of time deposits of RMB13.9 billion, partially offset by purchase of short-term investments of RMB70.6 billion,
placements of time deposits of RMB10.2 billion, cash paid for long term investments including loans of RMB1.5 billion, cash consideration paid for
purchase of subsidies, net of cash acquired of RMB1.2 billion and purchase of intangible assets of RMB2.0 billion, which primarily consisted of
licensed copyrights of video content.

      Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 was RMB24.6 billion, primarily due to purchase of short-term investments of RMB71.7 billion,
placements of time deposits of RMB10.7 billion, cash paid for long term investments including loans of RMB6.7 billion and purchase of intangible
assets of RMB2.7 billion, which primarily consist of licensed copyrights of video content, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term
investments of RMB60.5 billion and maturity of time deposits of RMB7.7 billion.


Financing activities
       Net cash used in financing activities in 2023 was RMB5,074.7 million (US$714.8 million), primarily attributable to the repurchase of issuance of
convertible senior notes, net of issuance costs, of RMB7.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) and the repayment of short-term loan of RMB2.0 billion (US$0.3
billion), partially offset by the proceeds from issuances of ordinary shares net of issuance costs of RMB2.7 billion (US$0.4 billion) and proceeds of
short-term loans of RMB2.0 billion (US$0.3 billion).

      Net cash used in financing activities in 2022 was RMB4,354.9 million, primarily attributable to the repurchase of convertible senior notes and
shares of RMB4.5 billion.

      Net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was RMB30.4 billion, primarily attributable to the proceeds we received from our Global
Offering of approximately RMB19.3 billion and the proceeds we received from our offering of December 2026 Notes of RMB10.1 billion.


Material cash requirements
     Our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023 primarily include our capital expenditures, operating lease commitments, and
convertible senior notes obligations.

                                                                           136
Table of Contents

      We intend to fund our existing and future material cash requirements with our existing cash balance, cash generated from operating activities, and
other financing alternatives. We will continue to make cash commitments, including capital expenditures, to support the growth of our business.


   Capital expenditures
      Our capital expenditures are primarily incurred for purchases of intangible assets and property and equipment. Our capital expenditures were
RMB3.7 billion, RMB2.7 billion and RMB1.3 billion (US$187.3 million) in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Purchases of intangible assets, which
primarily consist of licensed copyrights of video content, accounted for 73.8%, 72.2% and 86.3% of our total capital expenditures in 2021, 2022 and
2023, respectively.


   Operating lease commitments
     Our operating lease commitments consist of the commitments under the lease agreements for our office premises. As of December 31, 2023, the
amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, whose weighted average remaining lease term is 2.6 years, was RMB503.5 million
(US$70.9 million), of which RMB201.7 million (US$28.4 million) is short term.


   Convertible senior notes obligations
      Our convertible senior notes obligations consist of the principal amount and cash interests in connection with our April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes
and December 2026 Notes. As of December 31, 2023, an aggregate principal amount of US$429.3 million, US$0.1 million and US$432.4 million of our
April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, and December 2026 Notes, respectively, remained outstanding.

       As of the date of this annual report, holders of the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on
April 1, 2024, in the case of the April 2026 Notes, June 15, 2025, in the case of the 2027 Notes, and December 1, 2024, in the case of the December
2026 Notes. In addition, each of the Bilibili Convertible Senior Notes contains similar provisions concerning the holders’ right to require us to
repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the terms of such notes), as well as similar provisions regarding our
ability to redeem the existing notes in case of certain changes in tax law. For details, please see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry—If we cannot obtain sufficient cash when we need it, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under
our convertible senior notes” and “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

     Other than as discussed above, we did not have any significant capital and other commitments, long-term obligations or guarantees as of

        Bilibili Inc. is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our PRC subsidiaries, the
VIEs and their subsidiaries in mainland China. As a result, Bilibili Inc.’s ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries.
If our existing PRC subsidiaries or any newly formed ones incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict
their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in mainland China are permitted to pay dividends to us only out
of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our subsidiaries
and the VIEs in mainland China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until
such reserve funds reach 50% of their registered capital. In addition, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in mainland China may allocate a portion of
their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion funds and staff bonus and welfare funds at their discretion, and the
VIEs may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to a surplus fund at their discretion. The statutory reserve funds
and the discretionary funds are not distributable as cash dividends. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned company out of mainland China
is subject to examination by the banks designated by SAFE. Our PRC subsidiaries have not paid dividends and will not be able to pay dividends until
they generate accumulated profits and meet the requirements for statutory reserve funds.

                                                                             137

C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc.
Technology, Research and Development
      Our technology platform has been designed for reliability, scalability and flexibility and is administered by our in-house technology department.
As of December 31, 2023, we had access to a nationwide network of 47,311 servers that we own and 4,966 servers we lease, with power supply and
power generator backup. This structure, along with other features described below, contributes to the reliability, scalability and efficiency of our
network.

      AI and big data analytics. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is particularly suitable for reviewing and screening content by recognizing and analyzing
patterns and connections. As the varieties and quantity of content and user interactions continue to increase, AI capabilities are critical for us to control
our operating costs and enhance user experience. We utilize big data analytics to create an interest profile for each user account based on user’s actions
such as post, bullet chatting, comment, like and follow, and demographic data such as age, gender and geography. Empowered by our AI capabilities,
our interest profile allows us to personalize user interface and push content to our users that they are more likely to find interesting and relevant.

       We also leverage AI technology in content management and review procedures to monitor the content uploaded to our platform to detect
inappropriate or illegal content and to promptly remove any infringing content. Our proprietary AI-based screening system automatically flags and
screens out newly uploaded videos that have privacy issues or contain illegal or inappropriate content by comparing them with copyrighted or
objectionable videos stored in our own in-house “blacklist” databases and identifying those with similar codes, i.e., the key words in the video contents.
Utilizing various technology models and samples gathered internally or based on regulatory requirements, we build, maintain and continuously update
our databases to meet the changing regulatory requirements. Once the content is processed by this technology screening system, the system then extracts
fingerprint trails (the technical features that identify and distinguish a video) from the content and sends them to our content screening team for the
second-level review. All of the other content, primarily consisting of bullet chats posted by users, is also automatically filtered by our screening system,
which utilizes an AI-based screening system to conduct semantic analysis on bullet chats to analyze, identify and screen out inappropriate bullet chats.
Utilizing our proprietary technology, upon user’s instruction to block certain key words in the bullet chats, our platform can execute this instruction
while still streaming the video on a real-time basis without re-loading the entire video. We employ our proprietary technology to conduct semantic
analysis of each user’s favorites, blocks and comments settings, so as to understand each user’s unique preference and customarily filter the bullet chats,
so that each user’s bullet chatting viewing experience is customized.

       We have developed a series of big data analytics technology and obtained a number of patents in relation to big data storage and computation,
interactive query, real-time computation, and other infrastructure, so as to process and analyze a huge amount of data real time with accuracy and
stability. For example, we invented a system and methodology to monitor real-time data stream in multi-link transmission which can accurately analyze
big data real-time transmission, spot inconsistency in the system within minutes, and promptly react to and report such issues. This technology is applied
in data integration, an infrastructure in the big data analytics field, to ensure the completeness of data integration and to facilitate the accuracy of big
data analytics, as big data storage, calculation, visualization, application and other upper modules are all computed based on the data generated from the
data integration. We also invented a methodology and middleware to access data by combining centralized database, centralized memory cache, local
memory cache and local documents cache, so as to improve the stability of the system upon centralized access to data and the efficiency of the system
upon large amount of data access, while preventing data inconsistency.

      Cloud. Due to the nature of the products and services we offer, we have a high demand for storage and computing capacities to enhance the
functionalities of our video player, including running algorithms to produce content recommendations. We have developed an advanced cloud system
that meets the operational needs of our platform while reducing operating costs.

                                                                             138

       Content distribution network. Our web server technology focuses on reducing bandwidth use while enhancing user experience through utilizing
our content distribution network, or CDN, system. Our CDN components are strategically deployed in the cities where our users concentrate, enabling
users to access a copy of the content closest to them so that content loading time is minimized. Our proprietary CDN system enhances network
efficiency by managing and optimizing the workload of the servers through real-time optimization and distribution. This technology allows users to
upload content without compression and enables viewing of content in higher definition.

      Real-time monitoring and support. We have a network operation support team responsible for the stability and security of our network on a
24-hour, seven-days-a-week basis. The primary responsibilities of the team members consist of monitoring system performance, troubleshooting,
detecting system error, random sample testing on servers, maintaining equipment, and testing, evaluating and installing hardware and software.


Intellectual Property
      We seek to protect our technology, including our proprietary technology infrastructure and core software system, through a combination of
patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we have registered approximately 1,281 patents,
2,768 registered copyrights, 355 registered domain names, including www.bilibili.com, and 8,693 registered trademarks, including “             ..” In
addition, we had submitted approximately 2,400 additional patent applications and 321 trademark applications.

       We intend to protect our technology and proprietary rights vigorously, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Even if our
efforts are successful, we may incur significant costs in defending our rights. From time to time, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging
infringement of their proprietary rights or declaring their non-infringement of our intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could
result in material damage to our reputation and brand, payment of substantial damages, penalties and fines, removal of relevant content from our
platform or seeking license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms” and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may not be able to prevent others from engaging in unauthorized use of our intellectual
property, unfair competition, defamation or other violations of our rights, which could harm our business and competitive position.”


D. Trend Information
      Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events since
January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net sales or revenues, income from continuing
operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future
operating results or financial condition.


E. Critical Accounting Estimates
      We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. We
continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experiences and various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting
process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. Our critical accounting estimates require a higher
degree of judgment than others in their application and involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them
have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For a detailed discussion of our significant
accounting policies and related judgments, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies” of our audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.

                                                                            139

Revenue recognition for in-game virtual items
     We recognize revenue from the sale of in-game virtual items in exclusively distributed mobile games over the estimated average playing period of
paying players, starting from the point-in-time when related in-game virtual items are delivered to the paying players’ accounts.

      Nature of Estimates Required—average playing period of paying players. The average playing period of paying player is subjected to period
assessment. Considering the events or circumstances may change that indicate the change of the estimate, we assessed the average playing period of
paying player on a quarterly basis. We make a qualitative and quantitative assessment to determine the average playing period of paying players for each
game. If a qualitative and quantitative assessment identifies the change of the average playing period of paying players based on newly available paying
players information, we may prospectively apply the change of estimate.

       Assumptions Used. Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect average playing period of paying players and, therefore, can affect
the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making the average playing period of paying player for each game:
       Paying players’ churn rates. To compute the estimated average playing period for paying players, we consider the initial purchase date as the
starting point of a paying player’s lifespan. We track the population of paying players who made their initial purchases during the interval period, or the
Cohorts, and tracks each Cohort to understand the subsequent churn rate of the paying players of each Cohort, i.e. the number of paying players from
each Cohort who left subsequent to their initial purchases, or the churn rate. To determine the ending point of a paying player’s lifespan beyond the date
for which observable data are available, we extrapolate the historical churn rate to arrive at an average playing period for paying players of the selected
games.

       Similarities between newly launched games and existing games. We make assumption regarding similarities between newly launched games and
existing games included in and affected our assumptions regarding playing patterns for paying players for other games with similar characteristics with
the new games. If a new game is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is available, we consider the estimated average playing period
of our other mobile games which have similar characteristics with the new game. When we believe that we can reasonably estimate average playing
period of new games based on newly available paying players information, we may prospectively apply the change of estimate.

      In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimate, the assumptions are evaluated accordingly considering historical players’ churn rates,
playing patterns for paying players and management judgment. Updates to these assumptions will impact the estimate average playing period of paying
players and the revenue recognized accordingly. If the estimate average playing period of paying players is extended, the revenue will be recognized
over a longer period and vice versa. See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements
included in this annual report on Form 20-F, for additional information regarding the revenue recognition of mobile game services.


Impairment on the investment accounted for using the measurement alternative
      For those equity investments without significant influence and readily determinable fair value, we record these investments at cost, less
impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes.

      Nature of Estimates Required—Investment accounted for using the measurement alternative. We assess the impairment on the investment
accounted for using the measurement alternative on a quarterly basis, and the assumptions and judgment used in establishing the impairment are
evaluated regularly. When an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the investment accounted for using the measurement alternative may be
impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the
investment accounted for using the measurement alternative is above its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
Because the impairment indicator may vary substantially over time, estimating the impairment requires a number of assumptions about matter that are
uncertain.

                                                                            140
Table of Contents

      Assumptions and Approach Used—Impairment assessment. The approach we used to assess investment impairment are based on assumptions and
management judgment in considering various factors and events. Many of the factors used in assessing performance and financial position of the
investee are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and judgment may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or
management judgment can materially affect to find the impairment indicator, therefore, can affect the test results.

      Assumptions and Approach Used—Fair value of the investees. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we estimate the
investment’s fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC 820. We measure the fair value of the investees based on market approach or income
approach.

      The market approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or similar investment of
investees being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes.

      The income approach is another method for measuring the fair value of the investment and uses cash flow projections. Inherent in the investees’
development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of the investees’ operating results, business plan forecasts,
expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about
future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these
assumptions and estimates may change in future periods.

      Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of the investment and, therefore, can affect the test results.
The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections:
       •     Business projections. We make assumptions about the investees’ business in the marketplace. These assumptions drive our planning
             assumptions for each revenue streams. We also make assumptions about cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These
             projections are derived using investees’ business plan forecasts.
       •     Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-
             free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which the investees’ business unit’s earnings stream is projected to grow
             beyond the planning period.
       •     Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average
             cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall
             risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.
       •     Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry
             sales and pricing estimates for the investees’ business. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, regulatory,
             economic, or technological development, inflation, interest rates, customer preference, and foreign currency exchange rates.

      In the year of 2023, we assessed the above indicators, then determined that there were impairment indicators and RMB278.9 million investment
impairment were charged. See Note 9. Long-term Investments, Net in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this
annual report on Form 20-F for additional information regarding the impairment investment accounted for using the measurement alternative.

Class Z ordinary shares, representing 10% of the total number of issued Class Z ordinary shares as of the date on which Bilibili’s voluntary conversion
of its secondary listing status to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange becomes effective (excluding Class Z ordinary shares underlying
awards which have terminated, expired or lapsed in accordance with that have been forfeited in accordance with the 2018 Plan).

      The aggregate number of Class Z ordinary shares available for future grant under the 2018 Plan was 19,909,908 as of February 29, 2024.

       The Class Z ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to the awards under the 2018 Plan may be in the form of new shares to be issued by us or
in the form of shares or ADSs that may be purchased in the open market by us or a third-party trust from time to time in connection with the 2018 Plan.

      The following paragraphs describe the principal terms of the 2018 Plan.

      Types of Awards. The 2018 Plan permits the awards of options, restricted shares, and restricted share units.

      Plan Administration. Our board of directors or a committee of one or more members of the board of directors will administer the 2018 Plan. The
committee or the full board of directors, as applicable, will determine the participants to receive awards, the type and number of awards to be granted to
each participant, and the terms and conditions of each award under the 2018 Plan.

      Award Agreement. Awards granted under the 2018 Plan are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth terms, conditions and limitations for
each award, which may include the term of the award, the provisions applicable in the event that the grantee’s employment or service terminates, and
our authority to unilaterally or bilaterally amend, modify, suspend, cancel or rescind the award.

                                                                           144

     Eligibility. We may grant awards to our employees, directors and consultants of Bilibili under the 2018 Plan. In addition, under the 2018 Plan, we
may grant options that are intended to qualify as incentive share options only to our employees and employees of our subsidiaries.

     Vesting Schedule. Under the 2018 Plan, in general, the plan administrator determines the vesting schedule, which is specified in the relevant award
agreement.

     Exercise of Options. Under the 2018 Plan, the plan administrator determines the exercise price for each award, which is stated in the award
agreement. The vested portion of option will expire if not exercised prior to the time as the plan administrator determines at the time of its grant.
However, the maximum exercisable term is ten years from the date of a grant.

      Transfer Restrictions. Under the 2018 Plan, awards may not be transferred in any manner by the participant other than in accordance with the
exceptions provided in the relevant award agreement or otherwise determined by the plan administrator, such as transfers by will or the laws of descent
and distribution.

       Termination and Amendment. Unless terminated earlier, the 2018 Plan has a term of ten years. Our board of directors has the authority to amend or
terminate the 2018 Plan. Except with respect to amendments made by the plan administrator, no termination, amendment or modification may adversely
affect in any material way any awards previously granted pursuant to the 2018 Plan unless agreed by the participant.

      The following table summarizes, as of February 29, 2024, the number of ordinary shares underlying outstanding options and restricted share units
granted to several of our directors and executive officers and to other individuals as a group under the Global Share Plan and 2018 Plan, excluding
awards that were forfeited or cancelled after the relevant grant dates.

Equity Incentive Trusts
      Bilibili Inc. Global Share Incentive Trust and Bilibili Inc. Special Share Incentive Trust, which we collectively refer to as the Equity Incentive
Trusts, were established under their respective trust deeds, each dated November 28, 2017, between us and Ark Trust (Hong Kong) Limited, or Ark
Trust, as trustee of each of the Equity Incentive Trusts. Through the Equity Incentive Trusts, our ordinary shares and other rights and interests under
awards granted pursuant to our Global Share Plan may be provided to certain of recipients of equity awards. The participants in the Equity Incentive
Trusts include our employees and certain of our executive officers.

                                                                             145
Table of Contents

      Participants in the Equity Incentive Trusts transfer their equity awards to Ark Trust to be held for their benefit. Upon satisfaction of vesting
conditions and request by grant recipients, Ark Trust will exercise the equity awards and transfer the relevant ordinary shares and other rights and
interest under the equity awards to the relevant grant recipients with the consent of the trust administrator. Each of the trust deeds provides that Ark
Trust shall not exercise the voting rights attached to such ordinary shares unless otherwise directed by the trust administrator, which is an authorized
representative of our company.


C. Board Practices
Board of Directors
      Our board of directors consists of seven directors. A director is not required to hold any shares in Bilibili by way of qualification. Subject to the
Nasdaq Stock Market rules, a director may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which he is materially interested
provided (a) such director, if his interest in such contract or arrangement is material, has declared the nature of his interest at the earliest meeting of the
board at which it is practicable for him to do so, either specifically or by way of a general notice and (b) if such contract or arrangement is a transaction
with a related party, such transaction has been approved by the audit committee. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow
money, mortgage its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for
any obligation of the company or of any third party. None of our non-executive directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon
termination of service.


Committees of the Board of Directors
      We have established three committees under the board of directors: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and
corporate governance committee. We have adopted a charter for each of the three committees. Each committee’s members and functions are described
below.

      Audit Committee. Our audit committee consists of Eric He, JP Gan and Feng Li. Eric He is the chairman of our audit committee. We have
determined that Eric He, JP Gan and Feng Li each satisfies the “independence” requirements of Rule 5605(c)(2) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules and
meet the independence standards under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, as amended. We have determined that Eric He qualifies as an “audit
committee financial expert.” The audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of
our company. The audit committee is responsible for, among other things:
       •      appointing the independent registered public accounting firms and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be
              performed by the independent registered public accounting firms;
       •      reviewing with the independent registered public accounting firms any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response;
       •      discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firms;
       •      reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our accounting and internal control policies and procedures and any steps taken to monitor
              and control major financial risk exposures;
       •      reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;
       •      meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent registered public accounting firms; and
       •      monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our
              procedures to ensure proper compliance.

      Compensation Committee. Our compensation committee consists of JP Gan, Eric He and Feng Li. JP Gan is the chairman of our compensation
committee. We have determined that JP Gan, Eric He and Feng Li each satisfies the “independence” requirements of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq
Stock Market Rules. The compensation committee assists the board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of
compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting during which his
compensation is deliberated. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things:
       •      reviewing and approving, or recommending to the board for its approval, the compensation for our chief executive officer and other
              executive officers;

                                                                              146
Table of Contents

       •     reviewing and recommending to the board for determination with respect to the compensation of our non-employee directors;
       •     reviewing periodically and approving any incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements; and
       •     selecting compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser only after taking into consideration all factors relevant to that person’s
             independence from management.

       Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our nominating and corporate governance committee consists of JP Gan, Eric He and Feng
Li. JP Gan is the chairman of our nominating and corporate governance committee. We have determined that JP Gan, Eric He and Feng Li each satisfies
the “independence” requirements of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules. The nominating and corporate governance committee assists
the board of directors in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the board and its committees. The
nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things:
       •     selecting and recommending to the board nominees for election by the shareholders or appointment by the board;
       •     reviewing annually with the board the current composition of the board with regards to characteristics such as independence, knowledge,
             skills, experience and diversity;
       •     making recommendations on the frequency and structure of board meetings and monitoring the functioning of the committees of the board;
             and
       •     advising the board periodically with regards to significant developments in the law and practice of corporate governance as well as our
             compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and making recommendations to the board on all matters of corporate governance and on
             any remedial action to be taken.


Duties of Directors
       Under Cayman Islands law, our directors have a duty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our directors also have a
duty to exercise the care, diligence and skills that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. In fulfilling their duty of
care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and the
class rights vested thereunder in the holders of the shares. A shareholder may in certain circumstances have rights to damages if a duty owed by the
directors is breached.

     Our board of directors has all the powers necessary for managing, and for directing and supervising, our business affairs. The functions and
powers of our board of directors include, among others:
       •     convening shareholders’ annual general meetings and reporting its work to shareholders at such meetings;
       •     declaring dividends and distributions;
       •     appointing officers and determining the term of office of the officers;
       •     exercising the borrowing powers of our company and mortgaging the property of our company; and
       •     approving the transfer of shares in Bilibili, including the registration of such shares in our share register.

                                                                             147
Table of Contents

      You should refer to “Item 10. Additional information—B. Memorandum and Articles of Association—Differences in Corporate Law” for
additional information on our standard of corporate governance under Cayman Islands law.


Terms of Directors and Officers
       Our officers are elected by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors. At each annual general meeting one-third of the directors for the
time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest to but not less than one-third, shall retire from office by
rotation provided that every director (including those appointed for a specific term) shall be subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three
years. A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election. Bilibili Inc. at the general meeting at which a director retires may fill the vacated office. The
directors to retire by rotation shall include (so far as necessary to obtain the number required) any director who wishes to retire and not to offer himself
for re-election. Any director who has not been subject to retirement by rotation in the three years preceding the annual general meeting shall retire by
rotation at such annual general meeting. Any further directors so to retire shall be those who have been longest in office since their last re-election or
appointment and so that as between persons who became or were last re-elected directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise
agree among themselves) be determined by lot. A director is not required to retire upon reaching any particular age. A director will be removed from
office automatically if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; or (ii) is
found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind.

our business. We have granted and plan to continue to grant share-based incentive awards to our employees in the future to incentivize their
contributions to our growth and development.

       We enter into standard confidentiality and employment agreements with our key employees. The contracts with our key personnel typically
include a standard non-compete agreement that prohibits the employee from competing with us, directly or indirectly, during his or her employment and
for at least one year after the termination of his or her employment.


E. Share Ownership
     Except as otherwise noted, the following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of
February 29, 2024 by:
         •   each of our directors and executive officers; and
         •   each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our ordinary shares.

      The calculations in the table below are based on 83,715,114 Class Y ordinary shares and 328,441,712 Class Z ordinary shares outstanding as of
February 29, 2024 (excluding 9,104,591 Class Z ordinary shares issued and reserved for future issuance upon the exercising or vesting of awards
granted under our share incentive plan).

      Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially
owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days after
February 29, 2024, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or other right or the conversion of any other security. These shares, however,
are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person.

                                                                                                      Ordinary Shares Beneficially Owned

Shareholders Agreement and Investor Rights Agreement
       We entered into our shareholders agreement on April 1, 2017 with our shareholders, which consist of holders of ordinary shares and Preferred
Shares. Pursuant to this shareholders agreement, we have granted certain registration rights to our shareholders. Set forth below is a description of the
registration rights granted under the agreement.

       Demand Registration Rights. Holders holding at least 10% or more of the issued and outstanding registrable securities (on an as converted basis)
held by the preferred shareholders, the pre-IPO Class D ordinary shareholders, pre-IPO Class C ordinary shareholders or pre-IPO Class B ordinary
shareholders have the right to demand in writing that we file a registration statement covering the registration of at least 25% of their registrable
securities. We have the right to defer filing of a registration statement for a period of not more than 90 days if our board of directors determines in good
faith that filing of a registration statement in the near future will be materially detrimental to us or our shareholders, but we cannot exercise the deferral
right more than once for more than once during any twelve-month period and cannot register any other securities during such period. We are not
obligated to effect more than three demand registrations. Further, if the registrable securities are offered by means of an underwritten offering, and the
managing underwriter advises us that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten, the underwriters may decide
to exclude (i) all of the registrable securities in our initial public offering, or (ii) up to 75% of the registrable securities and the number of the registrable
securities will be allocated among the holders on a pro rata basis according to the number of registrable securities then outstanding held by each holder
requesting registration; provided that all other equity securities are first excluded.

       Registration on Form F-3 or Form S-3. Any holder may request us to file a registration statement on Form F-3 or Form S-3 if we qualify for
registration on Form F-3 or Form S-3. The holders are entitled to an unlimited number of registrations on Form F-3 or Form S-3 so long as such
registration offerings are in excess of US$500,000. We, however, are not obligated to consummate a registration if we have consummated two
registrations within any twelve-month period. We have the right to defer filing of a registration statement for a period of not more than 90 days if our
board of directors determines in good faith that filing of a registration statement in the near future will be materially detrimental to us or our
shareholders, but we cannot exercise the deferral right more than once for more than once during any twelve-month period and cannot register any other
securities during such period.

        Piggyback Registration Rights. If we propose to register for a public offering or our securities other than relating to any share incentive plan or a
corporate reorganization, we must offer holders of our registrable securities an opportunity to be included in such registration. If the underwriters advise
in writing that market factors require a limitation of the number of registrable securities to be underwritten, the underwriters may decide to exclude
(i) all of the registrable securities in our initial public offering, or (ii) up to 75% of the registrable securities and the number of the registrable securities
will be allocated among the holders on a pro rata basis according to the number of registrable securities then outstanding held by each holder requesting
registration; provided that all other equity securities are first excluded (except for securities sold for the account of our company).

                                                                               151

      Expenses of Registration. We will bear all registration expenses, other than the underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the
sale of registrable securities, incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualification pursuant to the shareholders agreement.

       Termination of Obligations. We have no obligation to effect any demand, piggyback or Form F-3 or Form S-3 registration upon the later of (i) the
fifth anniversary from the date of closing of a QIPO as defined in the shareholders agreement, and (ii) with respect to any holder, the date following a
QIPO on which such holder holds less than 1% of the equity securities of our company and all registrable securities may be sold under Rule 144 of the
Securities Act in any 90-day period.

       Pursuant to the share purchase and investor rights agreement by and between us and Tencent Mobility Limited dated October 3, 2018, we have
granted certain registration rights to Tencent Mobility Limited or its affiliates. Accordingly, Tencent Mobility Limited or its affiliates are entitled one
registration on Form F-3, after the expiration of a lock-up period, covering such Class Z ordinary shares issued and sold to Tencent Mobility Limited
pursuant to the aforesaid share purchase and investor rights agreement.


Employment Agreements and Indemnification Agreements
       We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Under these agreements, each of our executive officers is
employed for a specified time period. We may terminate employment for cause, at any time, without advance notice or remuneration, for certain acts of
the executive officer, such as conviction or plea of guilty to a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, negligent or dishonest acts to our detriment,
or misconduct or a failure to perform agreed duties. We may also terminate an executive officer’s employment without cause upon three-month advance
written notice. In such case of termination by us, we will provide severance payments to the executive officer as expressly required by applicable law of
the jurisdiction where the executive officer is based. The executive officer may resign at any time with a three-month advance written notice.

       Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the termination or expiry of his or her employment agreement, in strict confidence
and not to use, except as required in the performance of his or her duties in connection with the employment or pursuant to applicable law, any of our
confidential information or trade secrets, any confidential information or trade secrets of our clients or prospective clients, or the confidential or
proprietary information of any third party received by us and for which we have confidential obligations. The executive officers have also agreed to
disclose in confidence to us all inventions, designs and trade secrets which they conceive, develop or reduce to practice during the executive officer’s
employment with us and to assign all right, title and interest in them to us, and assist us in obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and other legal
rights for these inventions, designs and trade secrets.

       In addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of his or her
employment and typically for one year following the last date of employment. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to (i) approach our
suppliers, clients, customers or contacts or other persons or entities introduced to the executive officer in his or her capacity as a representative of us for
the purpose of doing business with such persons or entities that will harm our business relationships with these persons or entities; (ii) assume
employment with or provide services to any of our competitors, or engage, whether as principal, partner, licensor or otherwise, any of our competitors,
without our express consent; or (iii) seek directly or indirectly, to solicit the services of any of our employees who is employed by us on or after the date
of the executive officer’s termination, or in the year preceding such termination, without our express consent.

      We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, we agree to
indemnify our directors and executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by
reason of their being a director or officer of Bilibili.

      Purchases of goods and services. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, we purchased goods and promotional and other

    Sale of goods and services. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, we sold goods and live broadcasting and other services
amounting to RMB9.1 million, RMB14.0 million and RMB12.7 million (US$1.8 million), respectively, to certain related parties.

       Loans to the Entity. In 2020, we established an entity with an independent third party and two entities each controlled by Mr. Rui Chen and
Ms. Ni Li to acquire the land use rights for a parcel of land in Shanghai for future construction. We provided interest-bearing guaranteed loans to this
entity for its operation. The interest rates of the loans referenced loan prime rate (LPR) and ranged from 3.3% to 4.15% per annum. For the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the largest outstanding amount of the loans was RMB1,709.7 million. In 2023, this entity repaid RMB636.4 million

ITEM 8.      FINANCIAL INFORMATION
A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information
      We have appended consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report.


Legal Proceedings
      We may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are
currently involved in approximately 200 lawsuits based on allegations of infringement of third-party copyright due to the content posted on our
platform, which are immaterial to our company on an individual basis or a collective basis. Material litigation or any other material legal or
administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s
time and attention.

     Under the current PRC regulatory scheme, a number of regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the National Radio and Television
Administration, the National Press and Publication Administration, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, and the Cyberspace Administration of China, jointly regulate all major aspects of the internet industry, including the mobile internet and
mobile games business. Operators must obtain various government approvals and licenses for relevant mobile business.

      We have obtained Value-added Telecommunication Business Licenses for the provision of value-added telecommunication business, License for
Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs for the provision of internet audio-visual program services, Online Culture Operating Permits for
operation of commercial internet culture activities, and License for Production and Operation of Radio and Television Programs for the radio, television
and anime production and operation business. These licenses are essential to the operation of our business and are generally subject to regular
government review or renewal.

       Under regulations issued by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, the publication of each online game
requires approval from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, and after the institutional restructuring of the State
Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, we currently apply with the National Press and Publication Administration for the
approvals for publishing our games. As of the date of this annual report, we have obtained approvals from the National Press and Publication
Administration for all of the domestic and imported online games exclusively operated by us which are in operation in the PRC. For the online games
we jointly operate with third parties, we also require them to obtain requisite approvals from the National Press and Publication Administration. In 2021,
2022 and 2023, substantially all of the revenues from our jointly operated mobile games in China were contributed by approximately 30 of our online
jointly operated mobile games in the PRC, and all of them have obtained approvals from the National Press and Publication Administration.

                                                                           153

Dividend Policy
      Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain requirements of Cayman Islands law. Even if
our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital
requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.

       We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if
not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.

       Bilibili is a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It may rely on dividends from its subsidiaries in China for its cash
requirements, including any payment of dividends to its shareholders. PRC regulations may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends
to us. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Related to Dividend Distributions.”

      If we pay any dividends on our ordinary shares, we will pay those dividends which are payable in respect of the Class Z ordinary shares
underlying the ADSs to the depositary, as the registered holder of such Class Z ordinary shares, and the depositary then will pay such amounts to the
ADS holders in proportion to Class Z ordinary shares underlying the ADSs held by such ADS holders, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement,
including the fees and expenses payable thereunder. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars.


B. Significant Changes
      We have not experienced any significant changes since the date of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.


ITEM 9.      THE OFFER AND LISTING
A. Offering and Listing Details
       See “C. Markets” for our host market and trading symbol. We have a dual-class common share structure in which Class Y ordinary shares have
different voting rights from Class Z ordinary shares. Class Y ordinary shares are each entitled to ten votes, whereas Class Z ordinary shares are each
entitled to one vote. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Listed Securities—Our dual-class share structure with
different voting rights will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions
that holders of our Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial.”

B. Memorandum and Articles of Association
      The following are summaries of material provisions of our eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that we have
adopted and of the Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands, or the Companies Act, insofar as they relate to the material terms of our
ordinary shares.


Shares
      Objects of Our Company. Under our eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the objects of our company are
unrestricted and we have the full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the Companies Act or any other law of the Cayman
Islands.

       Ordinary Shares. Our ordinary shares are divided into Class Y ordinary shares and Class Z ordinary shares. Holders of our Class Y ordinary shares
and Class Z ordinary shares will have the same rights except for voting and conversion rights. Each Class Z Ordinary Share shall entitle the holder
thereof to one (1) vote on all matters subject to vote at our general meetings, and each Class Y ordinary share shall entitle the holder thereof to ten
(10) votes on all matters subject to vote at our general meetings. Class Y ordinary shares shall only be held by the founder or a limited partnership, trust,
private company or other vehicle wholly owned or wholly controlled by the founder as defined as “Founder Holding Vehicle” under our eighth amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our ordinary shares are issued in registered form and are issued when registered in our register of
members. Our company shall not take any action (including the issue or repurchase of shares of any class) that would result in (a) the aggregate number
of votes entitled to be cast by all holders of Class Z ordinary shares (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding those who are also holders of Class Y
ordinary shares) present at a general meeting to be less than 10% of the votes entitled to be cast by all members at a general meeting; or (b) an increase
in the proportion of Class Y ordinary shares to the total number of shares in issue. No further Class Y ordinary shares shall be issued by our company,
except with the prior approval of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under limited circumstances as specified in the eighth amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association. In the event our company reduces the number of shares in issue (e.g., through a purchase of its own shares),
the holders of Class Y ordinary shares shall reduce their voting rights in our company proportionately, whether through a conversion of a portion of their
Class Y ordinary shares or otherwise, if the reduction in the number of shares in issue would otherwise result in an increase in the proportion of Class Y
ordinary shares to the total number of shares in issue.

                                                                            155
Table of Contents

       Conversion. Each Class Y ordinary share is convertible into one Class Z ordinary share at any time at the option of the holder thereof. Class Z
ordinary shares are not convertible into Class Y ordinary shares under any circumstances. Subject to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, as amended or supplemented from time to time, or Hong Kong Listing Rules, or other applicable laws or
regulations, each Class Y ordinary share shall be automatically converted into one Class Z ordinary share upon the occurrence of the following events:
(i) the death of the holder of such Class Y ordinary share (or, where the holder is a holding vehicle, the death of the founder holding or controlling such
vehicle); (ii) the holder of such Class Y ordinary share ceasing to be a director or a holding vehicle for the founder for any reason; (iii) the holder of such
Class Y ordinary share (or the founder holding or controlling the holding vehicle) being deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to be incapacitated
for the purpose of performing his duties as a director; (iv) the holder of such Class Y ordinary Share (or the founder holding or controlling the holding
vehicle) being deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to no longer meet the requirements of a director set out in the Hong Kong Listing Rules; and
(v) the transfer to another person of the beneficial ownership of, or economic interest in, such Class Y ordinary share or the control over the voting rights
attached to such Class Y ordinary share (through voting proxies or otherwise), other than certain exceptions as specified in the eighth amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association.

       Dividends. The holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. Our eighth amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association provide that dividends may be declared and paid out of funds legally available for distribution
including our profits, which our board of directors thinks fit. Dividends may also be declared and paid out of share premium account or any other fund
or account of our company which can be authorized for this purpose in accordance with the Companies Act. Under the laws of the Cayman Islands, our
company may pay a dividend out of either profit or share premium accounts; provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would
result in our company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.

      Voting Rights. Holders of our ordinary shares have the right to receive notice of, attend, speak and vote at general meetings of our company. On a
show of hands every shareholder present in person or proxy shall each have one vote and on a poll, each holder of Class Z ordinary shares is entitled to
one (1) vote per share and each holder of our Class Y ordinary shares is entitled to ten (10) votes per share on all matters submitted to them for a vote at
our general meetings. Our company shall not change the terms of the Class Y ordinary shares to increase the number of votes to which each Class Y
ordinary share is entitled. Holders of our Class Y ordinary shares and Class Z ordinary shares shall at all times vote together as a single class on all
matters submitted to a vote by our shareholders, except as may otherwise be required by law. At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the
meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded by the chairman
of such meeting or any shareholder present in person or by proxy.

      A quorum required for a meeting of shareholders consists of one or more shareholders holding in aggregate not less than one-tenth of all votes
attaching to all shares of our company in issue and entitled to vote at such general meeting, present in person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other
non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative. Advance notice of at least twenty-one (21) calendar days is required for the convening of our
annual general meeting and at least fourteen (14) calendar days any other shareholders meetings.

       An ordinary resolution to be passed at a meeting by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes attaching to the
ordinary shares cast by those shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy (or, in the case of corporations, by their duly authorized
representatives) at a general meeting and of which not less than 14 days’ notice has been duly given. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of
no less than three-fourths of the votes cast by such shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy (or, in the case of corporations, by
their authorized representatives) at a general meeting. Both ordinary resolutions and special resolutions may also be passed by a unanimous written
resolution signed by all the shareholders of our company, as permitted by the Companies Act and our eighth amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association. A special resolution will be required for important matters such as a change of name or making changes that will affect the rights
of our shareholders.

                                                                             156
Table of Contents

       General Meetings of Shareholders. In each financial year during the period commencing from the date on which any of the securities of our
company first become listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, our company shall hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to
any other meeting in that year and shall specify the meeting as such in the notice calling it. Our company shall hold the annual general meeting within
six months after the end of its financial year. The annual general meeting shall be held in Hong Kong or such other territory where any of the securities
of our company is listed on a stock exchange in that territory, or elsewhere as may be determined by the board of directors and at such time and place as
the board of directors shall appoint. All general meetings (including an annual general meeting, any adjourned meeting or postponed meeting) may be
held as a physical meeting in Hong Kong or such other territory where any of the securities of our company is listed on a stock exchange in that territory
or elsewhere as may be determined by our board of directors, and at one or more locations as provided in Article 70A of our eighth amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association, as a hybrid meeting or as an electronic meeting, as may be determined by the board of directors in its
absolute discretion.

       An annual general meeting of our company shall be called by at least 21 days’ notice in writing, and a general meeting of our company, other than
an annual general meeting, shall be called by at least 14 days’ notice in writing. The notice shall be exclusive of the day on which it is served or deemed
to be served and of the day for which it is given, and shall specify the day, the hour and the agenda of the meeting and particulars of the resolutions to be
considered at that meeting. A quorum required for any general meeting of shareholders consists of one or more shareholders present in person or by
proxy (or, if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its authorized representative), representing not less than one-tenth of all votes attaching to all
of our shares in issue and entitled to vote at such general meeting. Where a general meeting is postponed by our directors, such meeting shall be
postponed to a specific date and time. Save for an electronic meeting, the notice shall specify the place of the meeting and if there is more than one
meeting location as determined by our board of directors pursuant to Article 70A of our eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association, the principal meeting place. If the general meeting is to be a hybrid meeting or an electronic meeting, the notice shall include a statement to
that effect and with details of the electronic facilities for attendance and participation by electronic means at the meeting or where such details will be
made available by our company prior to the meeting.

       The Companies Act provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any
right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our eighth amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that upon the requisition of shareholders representing in aggregate not less than one-tenth
of the votes (on a one-vote-per-share basis) attaching to all the issued and outstanding shares of our company that as at the date of the deposit carry the
right to vote at general meetings, our board will convene an extraordinary general meeting and put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such
meeting. However, our eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association do not provide our shareholders with any right to put any
proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings not called by such shareholders.

      Transfer of Ordinary Shares. Subject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares
by an instrument of transfer in writing, and shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor, and in respect a nil or partly paid up share, or if our
directors so requires, signed on behalf of the transferee.

      Our board of directors may decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share unless:
       •     the instrument of transfer is lodged with us, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other
             evidence as our board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
       •     the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of ordinary shares;
       •     the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required;

                                                                             157
Table of Contents

       •      in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the ordinary share is to be transferred does not exceed four;
              and
       •      a fee of sum as our directors may from time to time require is paid to us in respect thereof.

     If our directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within three (3) calendar months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was
lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.

      The registration of transfers may, after compliance with any notice required of the Nasdaq Stock Market, be suspended and the register closed at
such times and for such periods as our board of directors may from time to time determine; provided that the registration of transfers shall not be
suspended nor the register closed for more than thirty (30) days in any calendar year.

      Liquidation. Subject to the Companies Act, our company may at any time and from time to time be wound up voluntarily by special resolution.
On the winding up of our company, if the assets available for distribution amongst our shareholders shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of
the share capital at the commencement of the winding up, the surplus shall be distributed amongst our shareholders in proportion to the par value of the
shares held by them at the commencement of the winding up, subject to a deduction from those shares in respect of which there are monies due, of all
monies payable to our company for unpaid calls or otherwise. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay the whole of the share
capital, such assets will be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by our shareholders in proportion to the par value of the
shares held by them.

       Calls on Shares and Forfeiture of Shares. Our board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on
their shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the specified time of payment. The shares that have been
called upon and remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture.

      Redemption, Repurchase and Surrender of Shares. We may issue shares on terms that such shares are subject to redemption, at our option or at the
option of the holders of these shares, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our board of directors, or by the shareholders by
special resolutions. Our company may also repurchase any of our shares on such terms and in such manner as have been approved by our board of
directors or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders or otherwise authorized by our eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association. Under the Companies Act, the redemption or repurchase of any share may be paid out of our company’s profits or out of the proceeds of a
new issue of shares made for the purpose of such redemption or repurchase, or out of capital (including share premium account and capital redemption
reserve) if our company can, immediately following such payment, pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under
the Companies Act no such share may be redeemed or repurchased (a) unless it is fully paid up, or (b) if such redemption or repurchase would result in
there being no shareholders of the company holding shares other than treasury shares, or (c) if the company has commenced liquidation. In addition, our
company may accept the surrender of any fully paid share for no consideration.

       Variations of Rights of Shares. If at any time, our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class of shares
may, subject to any rights or restrictions for the time being attached to any class of shares, only be varied with the consent in writing of three-fourths of
the voting rights of the holders of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class by
the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class present in person or by proxy and voting at such meeting. The rights conferred upon the
holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares
of that class, be deemed to be materially adversely varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with such existing class of shares
or with enhanced or weighted voting rights or subsequent to such creation or issue, the redemption or repurchase of such shares.

      Issuance of Additional Shares. Our eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorizes our board of directors to issue
additional ordinary shares from time to time as our board of directors shall determine, to the extent of available authorized but unissued shares.

                                                                              158
Table of Contents

       Our eighth amended and restated memorandum of articles and association also authorizes our board of directors to establish by ordinary
resolutions from time to time one or more series of preference shares and to determine, with respect to any series of preference shares, the terms and
rights of that series, including:
       •     the designation of the series;
       •     the number of preferred shares to constitute such series and the subscription price thereof if different from the par value thereof;
       •     the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights; and
       •     the rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.

      Our board of directors may issue preference shares without action by our shareholders to the extent authorized but unissued. Issuance of these
shares may dilute the voting power of holders of ordinary shares.

      Inspection of Books and Records. During the period commencing from the date on which any of the securities of our company first become listed
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (except when the register is closed on terms equivalent to section 632 of the Companies Ordinance, Cap. 622 of the
Laws of Hong Kong as amended from time to time), any shareholder may inspect during business hours any register maintained in Hong Kong without
charge and require the provision to him of copies or extracts thereof in all respects as if our company were incorporated under and were subject to the
Companies Ordinance.

     Anti-Takeover Provisions. Some provisions of our eighth amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or
prevent a change of control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that:
       •     authorize our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges
             and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders; and
       •     limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders.

       However, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our eighth amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company.

      Exempted Company. We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Act. The Companies Act distinguishes between
ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of
the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an
ordinary company except that an exempted company:
       •     does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;
       •     is not required to open its register of members for inspection;
       •     does not have to hold an annual general meeting;
       •     may issue shares with no par value;
       •     may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first
             instance);
       •     may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands;
       •     may register as an exempted limited duration company; and
       •     may register as a segregated portfolio company.

                                                                            159
Table of Contents

      “Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company
(except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other
circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).


Differences in Corporate Law
     The Companies Act is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent United Kingdom statutory
enactments, and accordingly there are significant differences between the Companies Act and the current Companies Act of England.

      In addition, the Companies Act differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of
certain significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to United States corporations and
companies incorporated in the State of Delaware and their shareholders.

      Mergers and Similar Arrangements. The Companies Act permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between
Cayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies. For these purposes, (1) “merger” means the merging of two or more constituent
companies and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company and (2) a “consolidation”
means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of
such companies in the consolidated company.

      In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or
consolidation, which must then be authorized by (1) a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (2) such other
authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association. The written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed
with the Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to, amongst other matters, the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a
statement of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be
given to the members and creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman
Islands Gazette. Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be
determined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a
merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.

      In addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate compromises or arrangements between a Cayman Islands company and its members (or
any class of them). merger between a Cayman parent company and its Cayman subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution
of shareholders of that Cayman subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that Cayman subsidiary to be merged unless that
member agrees otherwise. For this purpose a company is a “parent” of a subsidiary if it holds issued shares that together represent at least 90% of the
votes at a general meeting of the subsidiary.

       The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a
court in the Cayman Islands.

       Save in certain limited circumstances, a shareholder of a Cayman constituent company who dissents from the merger or consolidation is entitled to
payment of the fair value of his shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) upon dissenting to the
merger or consolidation, provide the dissenting shareholder complies strictly with the procedures set out in the Companies Act. The exercise of dissenter
rights will preclude the exercise by the dissenting shareholder of any other rights to which he or she might otherwise be entitled by virtue of holding
shares, save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful.

                                                                            160
Table of Contents

       Separate from the statutory provisions relating to mergers and consolidations, the Companies Act also contains statutory provisions that facilitate
the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies by way of schemes of arrangement. Section 86(2A) of the Companies Act provides that if 75% in
value of the members (or class of members) of a Cayman Islands company agree to any compromise or arrangement, such compromise or arrangement
shall, if sanctioned by the Cayman Court, be binding on all members (or class of members) of such company and on the company itself. Where a
Cayman Islands company is in the course of being wound up, such compromise or arrangement would be binding on the liquidator and contributories of
the company. Section 86(2) of the Companies Act also requires (a) approval by a majority in number representing 75% in value; and (b) the sanction of
the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, in relation to any compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors (or any class of them). At
the initial directions hearing, the Cayman Islands court will make orders for, amongst other things, the convening of the meetings of creditors or
members (or classes of them, as applicable). While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to
be approved, the Grand Court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:
       •     the company has complied with the directions set down by the Cayman Islands court;
       •     the meeting was properly held and the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;
       •     the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of
             the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class; and
       •     the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his/her interest.

      If a compromise or arrangement of a Cayman Islands company is approved by the members in the context of a members’ scheme and the Cayman
Islands court subsequently sanctions such scheme (as described above), a dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to the appraisal rights
which it would have if the company in question were a Delaware corporation (being the right to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined
value of its shares). This is because such scheme will be binding on all members (or class of members), regardless of whether all the members (or class
of members) approved the scheme, upon the sanction order being made. Having said that, a dissenting shareholder would have the right to appeal the
making of the sanction order to the Cayman Islands Court of Appeal, if there were grounds for doing so.

      Shareholders’ Suits. In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff to sue for a wrong done to us as a company, and as a general rule a
derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive
authority in the Cayman Islands, the Cayman Islands court can be expected to follow and apply the common law principles (namely the rule in Foss v.
Harbottle and the exceptions thereto) so that a non-controlling shareholder may be permitted to commence a class action against or derivative actions in
the name of our company to challenge actions where:
       •     an act which is ultra vires or illegal and is therefore incapable of ratification by the shareholders;
       •     the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not
             been obtained; and
       •     an act which constitutes a fraud against the minority where the wrongdoer are themselves in control of the company.

     Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability. Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a
company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision
may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of
committing a crime.

       Our memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in
their capacities as such unless such losses or damages arise from dishonesty or fraud of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally
the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.

                                                                             161
Table of Contents

     In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional
indemnification beyond that provided in our memorandum and articles of association.

      Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under
the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

       Directors’ Fiduciary Duties. Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its
shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the
care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to
shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction.

      The duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she
must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of
the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the
shareholders generally.

      In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken
was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should
such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the
transaction was of fair value to the corporation.

      As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and
therefore it is considered that he or she owes the following duties to the company:
       •     a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company,
       •     a duty not to make a personal profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him or her to do so),
       •     a duty not to put himself or herself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her
             duty to a third party, and
       •     a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended.

      A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty of care, diligence and skill. It was previously considered that a director need
not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and
experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these
authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.

      Shareholder Action by Written Consent. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to
act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Cayman Islands law and our currently effective memorandum and articles of
association provide that our shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of all
shareholders who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held.

      Shareholder Proposals. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting
of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors
or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.

                                                                             162
Table of Contents

       The Companies Act does not provide shareholders with an express right to put forth any proposal before a general meeting of the shareholders.
However, the Companies Act may provide shareholders with limited rights to requisition a general meeting but such rights must be stipulated in the
articles of association of the company.

      Any one or more shareholders holding in aggregate not less than one-tenth of the voting rights on a one vote per share basis, in the share capital of
the company at the date of deposit of the requisition shall at all times have the right, by written requisition to the board of directors or the secretary of
the company, to require an extraordinary general meeting to be called by the board of directors for the transaction of any business specified in such
requisition.

      Cumulative Voting. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for election of directors is not permitted unless the
corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders
on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which
increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director.

      There are no prohibitions relating to cumulative voting under the laws of the Cayman Islands, but our memorandum and articles of association do
not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a
Delaware corporation.

      Removal of Directors. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for
cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our
memorandum and articles of association, directors may be removed with or without cause, by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders at any time
before the expiration of his term of office notwithstanding anything in our memorandum and articles of association or in any agreement between our
company and such director (but without prejudice to any claim for damages under any such agreement).

       Transactions with Interested Shareholders. The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to
Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate
of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that
such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of
the target’s outstanding voting shares within the past three years.

      This statute has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not
be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors
approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any
potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.

       Cayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware
business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders,
it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper purpose and not with the effect
of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.

     Restructuring. A company may present a petition to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands for the appointment of a restructuring officer on the
grounds that the company:
       •      is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts; and
       •      intends to present a compromise or arrangement to its creditors (or classes thereof) either pursuant to the Companies Act, the law of a
              foreign country or by way of a consensual restructuring.

                                                                             163
Table of Contents

       The Grand Court may, among other things, make an order appointing a restructuring officer upon hearing of such petition, with such powers and
to carry out such functions as the court may order. At any time (i) after the presentation of a petition for the appointment of a restructuring officer but
before an order for the appointment of a restructuring officer has been made, and (ii) when an order for the appointment of a restructuring officer is
made, until such order has been discharged, no suit, action or other proceedings (other than criminal proceedings) shall be proceeded with or
commenced against the company, no resolution to wind up the company shall be passed, and no winding up petition may be presented against the
company, except with the leave of the court. However, notwithstanding the presentation of a petition for the appointment of a restructuring officer or the
appointment of a restructuring officer, a creditor who has security over the whole or part of the assets of the company is entitled to enforce the security
without the leave of the court and without reference to the restructuring officer appointed.

       Dissolution; Winding Up. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve,
dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board
of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in
its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board.

      Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its
members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding
up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so.

      Variation of Rights of Shares. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the
approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under Cayman Islands law and
our memorandum and articles of association, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any
class with the sanction of a special resolution passed by a majority of not less than three-fourths of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of
the shares of that class.

      Amendment of Governing Documents. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with
the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.

      Under Cayman Islands law, our memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with a special resolution of our shareholders.

      Rights of Non-resident or Foreign Shareholders. There are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles of association on the rights of
non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares.

     In addition, there are no provisions in our memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder
ownership must be disclosed.

      Inspection of Books and Records. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, any shareholder of a corporation may for any proper purpose
inspect or make copies of the corporation’s stock ledger, list of shareholders and other books and records.

      Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records (other
than the memorandum and articles of association, the register of mortgages and charges and any special resolutions passed by our shareholders) or
obtain copies of the list of shareholders of these companies. However, we intend to provide our shareholders with annual reports containing audited
financial statements.

E. Taxation
      The following summary of the material Cayman Islands, PRC and U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the ADSs or Class Z
ordinary shares is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this registration statement, all of which are subject to
change. This summary does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares, such as the tax
consequences under U.S. state and local tax laws or under the tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands, mainland China and the United
States. To the extent that the discussion related to matters of Cayman Islands tax law, it represents the opinion of Walkers (Hong Kong), our Cayman
Islands counsel, and to the extent that the discussion relates to matters of PRC tax law, it represents the opinion of Jingtian & Gongcheng.


Cayman Islands Taxation
      According to Walkers (Hong Kong), our Cayman Islands counsel, the Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations
based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to
be material to holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable
on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. In addition, the Cayman Islands does not impose withholding tax
on dividend payments. No stamp duty is payable in the Cayman Islands on transfers of shares of Cayman Islands companies except those which hold
interests in land in the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by our
company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.

      Payments of dividends and capital in respect of the ADSs or ordinary shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no
withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the ADSs or ordinary shares, nor will gains derived from the
disposal of the ADSs or ordinary shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.

      Our company has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and, as such, has
obtained an undertaking from the Government of the Cayman Islands as to tax concessions under the Tax Concessions Act (as amended). In accordance
with the provision of Section 6 of The Tax Concessions Act (as amended), the Governor in Cabinet undertakes with our company:
       •      that no law which is hereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall
              apply to Bilibili or its operations; and
       •      in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall
              be payable:
       •      on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of Bilibili; or
       •      by way of the withholding, in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in Section 6(3) of the Tax Concessions Act (as amended).

      These concessions shall be for a period of 20 years from March 14, 2018.

                                                                              165

PRC Taxation
       Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside mainland China with “de facto
management body” within mainland China is considered a resident enterprise. The implementation rules define the term “de facto management body” as
the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an
enterprise. In April 2009, the State Tax Administration issued a circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining
whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in mainland China. The State Tax
Administration issued Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises Income Tax Regulation, or the Bulletin 45, which took effect on
September 1, 2011 and was most recently amended on June 15, 2018, to provide more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82 and to clarify the
reporting and filing obligations of Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated resident enterprises. Bulletin 45 also provides procedures and administrative
details for the determination of resident status and administration of post-determination matters. Although Circular 82 only applies to offshore
enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the
circular may reflect the State Tax Administration’s general position on how the “de facto management body” text should be applied in determining the
tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC
enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in mainland China and will be subject to
PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational
management is in mainland China; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by
organizations or personnel in mainland China; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and
shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in mainland China; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually
reside in mainland China.

      We believe that Bilibili Inc. is not a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. Bilibili Inc. is not controlled by a PRC enterprise or PRC
enterprise group and we do not believe that Bilibili Inc. meets all of the conditions above. Bilibili Inc. is a company incorporated outside mainland
China. As a holding company, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its key assets are located, and its records (including the
resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained, outside mainland China. In addition, we are not aware of any
offshore holding companies with a similar corporate structure as ours ever having been deemed a PRC “resident enterprise” by the PRC tax authorities.
However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the
interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” We will continue to monitor our tax status.

      If the PRC tax authorities determine that Bilibili Inc. is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we may be required to
withhold a 10% withholding tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises, including the holders of the ADSs. In
addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) may be subject to a 10% PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other
disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within mainland China. It is unclear whether our non-PRC individual
shareholders (including the ADS holders) would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends or gains obtained by such non-PRC individual shareholders in
the event we are determined to be a PRC resident enterprise. If any PRC tax were to apply to such dividends or gains, it would generally apply at a rate
of 20% (and in the case of dividends would be withheld at source). The foregoing rates may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty, but it is unclear
whether non-PRC shareholders of Bilibili Inc. would be able to obtain the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and
mainland China in the event that Bilibili Inc. is treated as a PRC resident enterprise. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Doing Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable
tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.”


U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
       The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of our ADSs or Class Z
ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) that holds the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares as “capital assets” (generally, property held for
investment) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. This discussion is based upon existing U.S. federal tax law, which is
subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a
court will not take a contrary position. This discussion does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular
investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (including for example, financial
institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect
mark-to-market treatment, tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), holders who are not U.S. Holders, holders who own (directly,
indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of our stock (by vote or value), holders who acquire their ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares pursuant to any
employee share option or otherwise as compensation, investors that will hold their ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge,
conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors that have a functional currency other than
the U.S. dollars, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those discussed below). This discussion, moreover, does not
address the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or minimum tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares or the
Medicare tax on net investment income. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income
and other tax considerations of an investment in our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares.

                                                                            166
Table of Contents

General
      For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) created in, or organized under the law of, the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the
income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) the administration of
which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust or (B) that has otherwise validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person under the Code.

      If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of our ADSs or Class Z
ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
Partnerships holding our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares and their partners are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding an investment in our ADSs
or Class Z ordinary shares.

      For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will generally be treated as the beneficial owner of the underlying shares
represented by the ADSs. The remainder of this discussion assumes that a U.S. Holder of the ADSs will be treated in this manner. Accordingly, deposits
or withdrawals of Class Z ordinary shares for ADSs will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax.


Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations
      A non-U.S. corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i)
75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of “passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (generally
determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.
For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are categorized as a passive asset and the company’s goodwill and other unbooked
intangibles are taken into account. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the
disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any
other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock.

       Although the law in this regard is not entirely clear, we treat the VIEs as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, because we
control their management decisions and we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these entities, and, as a result, we
consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we do not own the stock
of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be treated as a PFIC for the current taxable year and any subsequent taxable year.

                                                                             167
Table of Contents

       Assuming that we are the owner of the VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and based upon the composition of our income and assets and
projections as to the value of our assets, including goodwill and other unbooked intangibles not reflected on our balance sheet, we do not believe that we
were a PFIC for the 2023 taxable year and we do not presently expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year. While we do not expect to be or become
a PFIC in the current taxable year, no assurance can be given that we are not or will not become classified as a PFIC because the determination of PFIC
status is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis and will depend, in part, upon the composition of our assets and income, and the continued
existence of our goodwill at that time. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent
taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, may be
determined by reference to the market value of our ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). In particular, recent declines in the market price of
the ADSs increased our risk of becoming a PFIC. The market price of the ADSs may continue to fluctuate considerably and, consequently, we cannot
assure you of our PFIC status for any taxable year. In addition, the composition of our income and our assets will be affected by how, and how quickly,
we spend our liquid assets. Under circumstances where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for capital expenditures and other
general corporate purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially increase.

      If we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares, we will generally continue to be
treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares, unless we cease to be a PFIC and a
“deemed sale” election is made, or a mark-to-market treatment (as further described below) applies to any year in which we are a PFIC.

      The discussion below under “Dividends” and “Sale or Other Disposition of ADSs or Class Z Ordinary Shares” is written on the basis that we will
not be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. federal income tax rules that apply if we are treated as a PFIC are generally
discussed below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”


Dividends
       Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” any cash distributions (including the amount of any tax
withheld) paid on our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income
tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the
U.S. Holder. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, any distribution we pay
will generally be treated as a “dividend” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

      A non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to tax on dividend income from a “qualified foreign corporation” at a lower applicable
capital gains rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain holding period requirements are met. A
non-U.S. corporation (other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable
year) will generally be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (i) if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United
States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of
information program, or (ii) with respect to any dividend it pays on stock (or ADSs in respect of such stock) which is readily tradable on an established
securities market in the United States. The ADSs are considered to be readily tradable on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is an established
securities market in the United States. Since we do not expect that our Class Z ordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market in the
United States, we do not believe that dividends that we pay on our Class Z ordinary shares that are not represented by ADSs will meet the conditions
required for the reduced tax rate. There can be no assurance that our ADSs will continue to be considered readily tradable on an established securities
market in later years.

       In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may become eligible for the
benefits of the U.S.-PRC income tax treaty (which the U.S. Treasury Department has determined is satisfactory for this purpose), or the Treaty, and in
that case we would be treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on our Class Z ordinary shares, or ADSs. Each
non-corporate U.S. Holder is advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income
for any dividends we pay with respect to our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares. Dividends received on our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares will not be
eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations.

                                                                            168

       Dividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes and will generally constitute passive
category income. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S. Holder may be
subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid on our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares. See “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—PRC
Taxation.” In that case, depending on the U.S. Holder’s individual facts and circumstances, a U.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of
complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit not in excess of any applicable treaty rate in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on
dividends received on our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares. A U.S. Holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may
instead claim a deduction, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in respect of such withholding, but only for a year in which such holder elects to do so
for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex and their outcome depends in large part on the U.S.
Holder’s individual facts and circumstances. In addition, under U.S. Treasury regulations, in absence of an election to apply the benefits of an applicable
income tax treaty, in order for foreign income taxes to be creditable the relevant foreign income tax rules must be consistent with certain U.S. federal
income tax principles, and we have not determined whether the PRC income tax system meets these requirements. Accordingly, U.S. Holders are urged
to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.


Sale or Other Disposition of ADSs or Class Z Ordinary Shares
      Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” a U.S. Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss
upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the
disposition and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in such ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the ADSs or
Class Z ordinary shares have been held for more than one year and will generally be U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Long-
term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. Holders is generally eligible for a reduced rate of taxation. The deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to
limitations.

       As described in “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—PRC Taxation,” if we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC
Enterprise Income Tax Law, gains from the disposition of the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares may be subject to PRC income tax and will generally be
U.S.-source, which may limit the ability to receive a foreign tax credit. If a U.S. Holder is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty, such holder may be able
to elect to treat such gain as PRC source income under the Treaty. In light of U.S. Treasury regulations, however, if a U.S. Holder is not eligible for the
benefits of the Treaty or does not elect to apply the Treaty, then such holder may not be able to claim a foreign tax credit arising from any PRC tax
imposed on the disposition of the Shares. The rules regarding foreign tax credits and deduction of foreign taxes are complex. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit or deduction in light of their particular circumstances, including their
eligibility for benefits under the Treaty, and the potential impact of the U.S. Treasury regulations.


Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
      If we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares, and unless the U.S.
Holder makes a mark-to-market election (as described below), the U.S. Holder will generally be subject to special tax rules that have a penalizing effect,
regardless of whether we remain a PFIC, on (i) any excess distribution that we make to the U.S. Holder (which generally means any distributions paid
during a taxable year to a U.S. Holder that are greater than 125 percent of the average annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or, if
shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition, including a
pledge, of ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares. Under the PFIC rules:
       •     the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares;
       •     the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in the U.S. Holder’s holding period prior to the first taxable year in
             which we are classified as a PFIC, each, a pre-PFIC year, will be taxable as ordinary income;
       •     the amount allocated to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year, will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for
             individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that year; and

                                                                             169
Table of Contents

       •     the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the tax attributable to each prior taxable year, other
             than a pre-PFIC year.

      If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares and any of our subsidiaries is also a
PFIC, such U.S. Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the
application of these rules. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries.

       As an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. Holder of “marketable stock” in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such
stock. The mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC, or
on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines is a qualified exchange that has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a
legitimate and sound fair market value. Our ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is an established securities market in the United
States. Consequently, if our ADSs continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and are regularly traded, we expect that the mark-to-market
election would be available to a U.S. Holder that holds our ADSs were we to be or become a PFIC. We expect the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, on
which our Class Z ordinary shares are listed, to be a qualified exchange but there can be no assurance in this regard because the IRS has not identified
specific non-U.S. exchanges as qualified for these purposes. Our ADSs and Class Z ordinary shares are expected to qualify as being regularly traded, but
no assurances may be given in this regard. If a U.S. Holder makes this election, the holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable
year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares held at the end of the taxable year over the
adjusted tax basis of such ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the ADSs or
Class Z ordinary shares over the fair market value of such ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares held at the end of the taxable year, but such deduction will
only be allowed to the extent of the amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. If a U.S.
Holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a corporation classified as a PFIC and such corporation ceases to be classified as a PFIC, the
holder will not be required to take into account the gain or loss described above during any period that such corporation is not classified as a PFIC. If a
U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, any gain such U.S. Holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our ADSs or Class Z ordinary
shares in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but such loss will only be treated as
ordinary loss to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder makes a
mark-to-market election it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the ADSs or
Class Z ordinary shares are no longer treated as marketable stock or the IRS consents to the revocation of the election.

      Because a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that we may own, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the
PFIC rules with respect to such U.S. Holder’s indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

       We do not intend to provide information necessary for U.S. Holders to make qualified electing fund elections which, if available, would result in
tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for PFICs described above.

      If a U.S. Holder owns our ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, the holder must generally file an annual
IRS Form 8621. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, holding and
disposing ADSs or Class Z ordinary shares if we are or become treated as a PFIC, including the possibility of making a mark-to-market election.

H.    Documents on Display
      We are subject to periodic reporting and other informational requirements of the Exchange Act as applicable to foreign private issuers, and are
required to file reports and other information with the SEC. Specifically, we are required to file annually an annual report on Form 20-F within four
months after the end of each fiscal year, which is December 31. All information filed with the SEC can be obtained over the internet at the SEC’s
website at www.sec.gov. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of
quarterly reports and proxy statements, and officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery
provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

      We will furnish Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, the depositary of the ADSs, with our annual reports, which will include a review of
operations and annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and all notices of shareholders’ meetings and
other reports and communications that are made generally available to our shareholders. The depositary will make such notices, reports and
communications available to holders of ADSs and, upon our request, will mail to all record holders of ADSs the information contained in any notice of a
shareholders’ meeting received by the depositary from us.

      In accordance with Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5250(d), we will post this annual report on Form 20-F on our website at http://ir.bilibili.com. In
addition, we will provide hardcopies of our annual report free of charge to shareholders and ADS holders upon request.

J.    Annual Report to Security Holders
     We intend to submit the annual report provided to security holders in electronic format pursuant to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities
on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited as an exhibit to a current report on Form 6-K.


ITEM 11.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign exchange risk
       Substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct
foreign exchange risk other than with respect to our -cash and cash equivalents and time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars and have not used any
derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk. Although our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited in general, the value
of the investment in the ADSs will be affected by the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Renminbi because the value of our business is effectively
denominated in RMB, while the ADSs will be traded in U.S. dollars.

      To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollars would
reduce the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making
payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs, servicing our outstanding debt and interests, or for other business purposes, appreciation of the
U.S. dollars against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollars amounts available to us.

      As of December 31, 2023, we had U.S. dollars-denominated cash and cash equivalents and time deposits of US$915.1 million. If the U.S. dollars
had appreciated or depreciated by 10% against the Renminbi, we would have had an increase or decrease of RMB648.1 million of cash and cash
equivalents and time deposits.


Interest rate risk
     Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash, which is mostly held in interest-bearing bank
deposits. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates, and
we have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure. However, our future interest income may fall short of
expectations due to changes in market interest rates.

                                                                            171

      Fees and Expenses

      As an ADS holder, you will be required to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental charges (in
addition to any applicable fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities represented by any of your ADSs):

                                        Service                                                                          Fees
      •       To any person to which ADSs are issued or to any person to which         Up to US$0.05 per ADS issued
              a distribution is made in respect of ADS distributions pursuant to
              stock dividends or other free distributions of stock, bonus
              distributions, stock splits or other distributions (except where
              converted to cash)
      •       Cancellation of ADSs, including the case of termination of the           Up to US$0.05 per ADS cancelled
              deposit agreement
      •       Distribution of cash dividends                                           Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
      •       Distribution of cash entitlements (other than cash dividends) and/or Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
              cash proceeds from the sale of rights, securities and other
              entitlements
      •       Distribution of ADSs pursuant to exercise of rights                      Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
      •       Distribution of securities other than ADSs or rights to purchase         Up to US$0.05 per ADS held
              additional ADSs
      •       Depositary services                                                      Up to US$0.05 per ADS held on the applicable record date(s) established
                                                                                       by the depositary bank

      As an ADS holder, you will also be responsible for paying certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary bank and certain taxes and
governmental charges (in addition to any applicable fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges payable on the deposited securities
represented by any of your ADSs) such as:
          •      Fees for the transfer and registration of Class Z ordinary shares charged by the registrar and transfer agent for the Class Z ordinary shares
                 in the Cayman Islands (i.e., upon deposit and withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares).

                                                                                 172
Table of Contents

       •      Expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into U.S. dollars.
       •      Expenses for cable, telex and fax transmissions and for delivery of securities.
       •      Taxes and duties upon the transfer of securities, including any applicable stamp duties, any stock transfer charges or withholding taxes (i.e.,
              when Class Z ordinary shares are deposited or withdrawn from deposit).
       •      Fees and expenses incurred in connection with the delivery or servicing of Class Z ordinary shares on deposit.
       •      Fees and expenses incurred in connection with complying with exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements applicable
              to Class Z ordinary shares, deposited securities, ADSs and ADRs.
       •      Any applicable fees and penalties thereon.

       The depositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of
their clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the
depositary bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash
or securities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable
ADS record date.

      The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable
property to pay the fees. In the case of distributions other than cash (i.e., share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the
ADS record date holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or
uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In the case of ADSs held in
brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is
the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who
hold their clients’ ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients’ accounts the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.

       In the event of refusal to pay the depositary fees, the depositary bank may, under the terms of the deposit agreement, refuse the requested service
until payment is received or may set off the amount of the depositary fees from any distribution to be made to the ADS holder.

       The depositary may make payments to us or reimburse us for certain costs and expenses, by making available a portion of the ADS fees collected
in respect of the ADR program or otherwise, upon such terms and conditions as we and the depositary bank agree from time to time. In 2023, we were
entitled to receive approximately US$1.3 million reimbursements from the depositary for our expenses incurred in connection with investor relationship
programs related to the ADS facility and the travel expense in connection with such programs.


Dealings and Settlement of Class Z Ordinary Shares in Hong Kong
      Our Class Z ordinary shares now trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in board lots of 20 ordinary shares. Dealings in our Class Z ordinary
shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are conducted in Hong Kong dollars.

       •     Accounting and Financial Reporting Council of Hong Kong transaction levy of 0.00015% of the consideration of the transaction, charged
             to each of the buyer and seller;
       •     trading tariff of HK$0.50 on each and every purchase or sale transaction. The decision on whether or not to pass the trading tariff onto
             investors is at the discretion of brokers;
       •     transfer deed stamp duty of HK$5.00 per transfer deed (if applicable), payable by the seller;
       •     ad valorem stamp duty at a total rate of 0.2% of the value of the transaction, with 0.1% payable by each of the buyer and the seller;
       •     stock settlement fee, which is currently 0.002% of the gross transaction value, subject to a minimum fee of HK$2.00 and a maximum fee
             of HK$100.00 per side per trade;
       •     brokerage commission, which is freely negotiable with the broker (other than brokerage commissions for IPO transactions which are
             currently set at 1% of the subscription or purchase price and will be payable by the person subscribing for or purchasing the securities);
             and
       •     the Hong Kong Share Registrar will charge between HK$2.50 to HK$20, depending on the speed of service (or such higher fee as may
             from time to time be permitted under the Hong Kong Listing Rules), for each transfer of ordinary shares from one registered owner to
             another, each share certificate canceled or issued by it and any applicable fee as stated in the share transfer forms used in Hong Kong.

       Investors must settle their trades executed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through their brokers directly or through custodians. For an investor
who has deposited his or her Class Z ordinary shares in his or her stock account or in his or her designated CCASS participant’s stock account
maintained with CCASS, settlement will be effected in CCASS in accordance with the General Rules of CCASS and CCASS Operational Procedures in
effect from time to time. For an investor who holds the physical certificates, settlement certificates and the duly executed transfer forms must be
delivered to his or her broker or custodian before the settlement date.


Conversion between Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong and ADSs
      In connection with the listing of our Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we have established a branch register of
members in Hong Kong, or the Hong Kong share register, which is maintained by our Hong Kong Share Registrar, Computershare Hong Kong Investor
Services Limited. Our principal register of members, or the Cayman share register, continues to be maintained by our Principal Share Registrar, Walkers
Corporate Limited.

       All Class Z ordinary shares offered in the Global Offering are registered on the Hong Kong share register in order to be listed and traded on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As described in further detail below, holders of Class Z ordinary shares registered on the Hong Kong share register are
able to convert these shares into ADSs, and vice versa.

     In connection with our listing in Hong Kong, and to facilitate fungibility and conversion between ADSs and Class Z ordinary shares and trading
between Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we have moved a portion of our issued Class Z ordinary shares from our register of members
maintained in the Cayman Islands to our Hong Kong share register.


The ADSs
      The ADSs are traded on Nasdaq. Dealings in the ADSs on Nasdaq are conducted in U.S. dollars.

      ADSs may be held either:
       •     directly (a) by having an American Depositary Receipt (ADR), which is a certificate evidencing a specific number of ADSs, registered in
             the holder’s name, or (b) by holding uncertificated ADSs in the direct registration system; or

                                                                           174

       •     indirectly, through the holder’s broker or other financial institution.

     The depositary for the ADSs is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, whose office is located at 1 Columbus Circle, 17th Floor, New York,
NY 10019, USA.


Converting Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong into ADSs
     An investor who holds Class Z ordinary shares registered in Hong Kong and who intends to convert them to ADSs to trade on Nasdaq must
deposit or have his or her broker deposit the Class Z ordinary shares with the depositary’s Hong Kong custodian, Deutsche Bank AG, Hong Kong
Branch, or the custodian, in exchange for ADSs.

      A deposit of Class Z ordinary shares trading in Hong Kong in exchange for ADSs involves the following procedures:
       •     If Class Z ordinary shares have been deposited with CCASS, the investor must transfer ordinary shares to the depositary’s account with the
             custodian within CCASS by following the CCASS procedures for transfer and submit and deliver a duly completed and signed letter of
             transmittal to the custodian via his or her broker.
       •     If Class Z ordinary shares are held outside CCASS, the investor must arrange to deposit his or her Class Z ordinary shares into CCASS for
             delivery to the depositary’s account with the custodian within CCASS, submit and deliver a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal
             to the custodian.
       •     Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, if applicable, and
             subject in all cases to the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will issue the corresponding number of ADSs in the name(s)
             requested by an investor and will deliver the ADSs to the designated DTC account of the person(s) designated by an investor or his or her
             broker.

      For Class Z ordinary shares deposited in CCASS, under normal circumstances, the above steps generally require two business days; provided that
the investor has provided timely and complete instructions. For Class Z ordinary shares held outside CCASS in physical form, the above steps may take
14 business days, or more, to complete. Temporary delays may arise. For example, the transfer books of the depositary may from time to time be closed
to ADS issuances. The investor will be unable to trade the ADSs until the procedures are completed.


Converting ADSs to Class Z Ordinary Shares Trading in Hong Kong
       An investor who holds ADSs and who intends to convert his/her ADSs into Class Z ordinary shares to trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
must cancel the ADSs the investor holds and withdraw Class Z ordinary shares from our ADS program and cause his or her broker or other financial
institution to trade such Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

      An investor that holds ADSs indirectly through a broker should follow the broker’s procedure and instruct the broker to arrange for cancelation of
the ADSs, and transfer of the underlying Class Z ordinary shares from the depositary’s account with the custodian within the CCASS system to the
investor’s Hong Kong stock account.

      For investors holding ADSs directly, the following steps must be taken:
       •     To withdraw Class Z ordinary shares from our ADS program, an investor who holds ADSs may turn in such ADSs at the office of the
             depositary (and the applicable ADR(s) if the ADSs are held in certificated form), and send an instruction to cancel such ADSs to the
             depositary. Such instructions must have a Medallion signature guarantee.
       •     Upon payment or net of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, if applicable,
             and subject in all cases to the terms of the deposit agreement, the depositary will instruct the custodian to deliver Class Z ordinary shares
             underlying the canceled ADSs to the CCASS account designated by an investor.

                                                                             175

       •     If an investor prefers to receive Class Z ordinary shares outside CCASS, he or she must receive ordinary shares in CCASS first and then
             arrange for withdrawal from CCASS. Investors can then obtain a transfer form signed by HKSCC Nominees Limited (as the transferor)
             and register Class Z ordinary shares in their own names with the Hong Kong Share Registrar.

       For Class Z ordinary shares to be received in CCASS, under normal circumstances, the above steps generally require two business days; provided
that the investor has provided timely and complete instructions. For Class Z ordinary shares to be received outside CCASS in physical form, the above
steps may take 14 business days, or more, to complete. The investor will be unable to trade the Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange until the procedures are completed.

       Temporary delays may arise. For example, the transfer books of the depositary may from time to time be closed to ADS cancellations. In addition,
completion of the above steps and procedures is subject to there being a sufficient number of Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong share registrar
to facilitate a withdrawal from the ADS program directly into the CCASS system. We are not under any obligation to maintain or increase the number of
Class Z ordinary shares on the Hong Kong share register to facilitate such withdrawals.


Depositary Requirements
      Before the depositary issues ADSs or permits withdrawal of Class Z ordinary shares, the depositary may require:
       •     production of satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or other information it deems necessary; and
       •     compliance with procedures it may establish, from time to time, consistent with the deposit agreement, including, but not limited to,
             completion and presentation of transfer documents.

      The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer, or register issuances, transfers and cancelations of ADSs generally when the transfer books of the
depositary or our Hong Kong or Cayman Share Registrar are closed or at any time if the depositary or we determine it advisable to do so, subject to such
refusal complying with U.S. federal securities laws.

       All costs attributable to the transfer of Class Z ordinary shares to effect a withdrawal from or deposit of Class Z ordinary shares into our ADS
program will be borne by the investor requesting the transfer. In particular, holders of Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs should note that the Hong Kong
Share Registrar will charge between HK$2.50 to HK$20, depending on the speed of service (or such higher fee as may from time to time be permitted
under the Hong Kong Listing Rules), for each transfer of Class Z ordinary shares from one registered owner to another, each share certificate canceled
or issued by it and any applicable fee as stated in the share transfer forms used in Hong Kong. In addition, holders of Class Z ordinary shares and ADSs
must pay up to US$5.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs for each issuance of ADSs and each cancelation of ADSs, as the case may be, in connection with the
deposit of Class Z ordinary shares into, or withdrawal of ordinary shares from, our ADS program.

                                                                          176

ITEM 15.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
      Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, which is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of
December 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act was accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.


Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15 (f)
under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.

      Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.


Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
      PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 as
stated in its report, which appears on page F-2 of this annual report on Form 20-F.


Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
      There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) during the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

                                                                           177

ITEM 16G.      CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
       Rule 5635(c) of the Nasdaq Rules requires a Nasdaq-listed company to obtain its shareholders’ approval for all equity compensation plans,
including stock plans, and any material amendments to such plans. Rule 5615 of the Nasdaq Rules permits a foreign private issuer like our company to
follow home country practice in certain corporate governance matters. We currently follow our home country practice that does not require us to seek
shareholder approval for amending our share incentive plan. Therefore, our shareholders are afforded less protection than they otherwise would under
the Nasdaq Global Market corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—
Risks Related to Our Listed Securities—As a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in
relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards, and these practices may afford
less protection to shareholders than shareholders would enjoy if we complied fully with the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.” In the
future, we may rely on other exemptions provided by Nasdaq.

ITEM 16K.      CYBERSECURITY
Risk Management and Strategy
      We have implemented comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment procedures to ensure effectiveness in cybersecurity management, strategy and
governance and reporting cybersecurity risks. We have also integrated cybersecurity risk management into our overall enterprise risk management
system.

      We have developed a comprehensive cybersecurity threat defense system to address both internal and external threats. We strive to manage
cybersecurity risks and protect sensitive information through various means, such as technical safeguards, procedural requirements, an intensive
program of monitoring on our corporate network, frequent testing of aspects of our security posture internally and with outside vendors, a robust
incident response program and regular cybersecurity awareness training for employees. Our IT department regularly monitors the performance of our
platforms, apps and infrastructure to enable us to respond quickly to potential problems, including potential cybersecurity threats.

      As of the date of this annual report, we have not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents or identified any material cybersecurity threats
that have affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.

                                                                           179

thorough review of information and disclosures. This involves our disclosure committee (comprising of the principal accounting officer or the head of
financial reporting, the head of the legal department, the principal investor relations officer, the principal officer in charge of cybersecurity matters, and
appropriate business unit heads of our company, as adjusted from time to time by the then incumbent committee members), as a whole, and the
executive directors of our company; and other members of senior management and external legal counsel, to the extent appropriate. The chief executive
officer, the chief financial officer, and the principal officer in charge of the cybersecurity matters are also responsible for assessing, identifying and

cybersecurity incident, maintaining oversight of the disclosure in Form 6-K for material cybersecurity incidents (if any) and meeting with our board of
directors (i) in connection with each quarterly earnings release, update the status of any material cybersecurity incidents or material risks from
cybersecurity threats to the Company, if any, and the relevant disclosure issues and (ii) in connection with each annual report, present the disclosure
concerning cybersecurity matters in Form 20-F, along with a report highlighting particular disclosure issues, if any, and hold a Q&A session. Our board
of directors is responsible for maintaining oversight of the disclosure related to cybersecurity matters in the periodic reports of our company.

                                              Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bilibili Inc.


Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bilibili Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also
have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.


Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.


Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

                                                                             F-2

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does
not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter
below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.


Revenue recognition for in-game virtual items
As described in Note 2(v) to the consolidated financial statements, revenues from mobile game services were RMB4,021.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023. Management recognized revenue from the sale of in-game virtual items in exclusively distributed mobile games over the estimated
average playing period of paying players, starting from the point-in-time when related in-game virtual items are delivered to the paying players’
accounts. Management has estimated the average playing period of paying players for each game, usually between one to ten months. Management
estimated the average playing period of paying players for each game, which involved the use of assumptions, related to the churn rates and the
similarities between newly-launched games and existing games, when a new game is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is
available.

The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for in-game virtual items is a critical audit
matter is the significant judgment by management in estimating the average playing period of paying players. This in turn led to significant auditor
judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating management’s assumptions used in developing these estimates, related to
the churn rates and the similarities between newly-launched games and existing games.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including
controls over the estimation of the average playing period of paying players for each game. These procedures also included, among others, testing
management’s process to estimate the average playing period of paying players by (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used; (ii) testing the
mathematic accuracy of the calculation; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the churn rates with reference to historical data, and the
reasonableness of the underlying assumption of the similarities between newly-launched games and existing games based on the characteristics of
mobile games and playing patterns of paying players.

1.    Operations
      Bilibili Inc. (the “Company” or “Bilibili”) is an iconic brand and a leading video community for young generations in China. Incorporated as a
limited liability company in the Cayman Islands in December 2013, the Company, through its consolidated subsidiaries, variable interest entities
(“VIEs”) and subsidiaries of the VIEs (collectively referred to as the “Group”), is primarily engaged in the operation of providing online entertainment
services to users in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”).

       In April 2018, the Company completed its IPO on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In March 2021, the Company successfully listed its
Class Z ordinary shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company issued a total 28,750,000 Class Z ordinary shares in the
global offering, including the fully exercised over-allotment option of 3,750,000 Class Z ordinary shares. Net proceeds from the global offering,
including the over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately HKD22.9 billion (RMB19.3
billion).

       On October 3, 2022 (the “Primary Conversion Effective Date”), the Company’s voluntary conversion of its secondary listing status to primary
listing on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange became effective. The Company became a dual-primary listed company on the main board
of Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Hong Kong and the NASDAQ Global Select Market in the United States.

       In January 2023, the Company completed the offering of 15,344,000 ADSs at US$26.65 per ADS. The amount of net proceeds from such offering
(after deducting all applicable costs and expenses including but not limited to selling commission) is approximately US$396.9 million (RMB2,689.4
million). Shortly thereafter, the Company completed repurchased of an aggregate principal amount of US$384.8 million (RMB2.6 billion) of its
outstanding 0.5% convertible senior notes due December 2026 with an aggregate purchase price of US$331.2 million (RMB2.2 billion), which was
funded by the net proceeds from the ADS Offering.

1.    Operations (Continued)
      Contractual agreements with major VIEs
       In order to comply with the PRC laws and regulations which prohibit or restrict foreign control of companies involved in provision of internet
content services, the Group operates its restricted businesses in the PRC through the VIEs, whose equity interests are held by certain founders of the
Group. The Company obtained control over these VIEs by entering into a series of contractual arrangements with the legal shareholders who are also
referred to as nominee shareholders. These nominee shareholders are the legal owners of the VIEs. However, the rights of those nominee shareholders
have been transferred to the Company through the contractual arrangements.

      The contractual arrangements that are used to control the VIEs include powers of attorney, exclusive technology consulting and services
agreements or exclusive business cooperation agreements, equity pledge agreements and exclusive option agreements. Management concluded that the
Company, through the contractual arrangements, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance,
bears the risks of and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the VIEs, and therefore the Company is the ultimate primary
beneficiary of these VIEs. As such, the Company consolidates the financial statements of these VIEs. Consequently, the financial results of the VIEs
were included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the presentation as stated in Note 2(a).

      The following is a summary of the contractual agreements entered into by and among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, the VIEs, and
respective nominee shareholders of the VIEs.

      Exclusive Technology Consulting and Services Agreements. Under the exclusive technology consulting and services agreements between the
Company’s relevant subsidiaries and the VIEs, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries have the exclusive right to provide the VIEs consulting and services
related to, among other things, research and development, system operation, advertising, internal training and technical support. The Company’s relevant
subsidiaries have the exclusive ownership of intellectual property rights created as a result of the performance of these agreements. These VIEs shall pay
the Company’s relevant subsidiaries an annual service fee, which are subject to the adjustment by the Company’s relevant subsidiaries at its sole
discretion. These agreements will remain effective for a 10 year’s term and then be automatically renewed, unless the Company’s relevant subsidiaries
give the VIEs a termination notice 90 days before the term ends. On December 23, 2020, the above agreements were replaced by the exclusive business
cooperation agreements, which contain terms substantially similar to the exclusive business cooperation agreements described above, the exclusive
business cooperation agreements have an infinite period commencing from December 23, 2020, unless the Company’s relevant subsidiaries give the
VIEs a termination notice 30 days before the term ends.

                                                                          F-14

      Contractual agreements with major VIEs (Continued)
       Exclusive Option Agreements. Pursuant to the exclusive purchase option agreement, among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, the VIEs and its
nominee shareholders, each of the nominee shareholders of the VIEs irrevocably granted the Company’s relevant subsidiaries an exclusive option to
purchase, or have its designated person to purchase, at its discretion, to the extent permitted under PRC law, all or part of their equity interests in the
VIEs, and the purchase price shall be the lowest price permitted by applicable PRC law. In addition, the VIEs irrevocably granted the Company’s
relevant subsidiaries an exclusive option to purchase, or have its designated person to purchase, at its discretion, to the extent permitted under PRC law,
all or part of the VIEs’ assets at the book value of such assets, or at the lowest price permitted by applicable PRC law, whichever is higher. The nominee
shareholders of the VIEs undertake that, without the prior written consent of the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, they shall not increase or decrease the
registered capital, dispose of its assets, incur any debts or guarantee liabilities, enter into any material purchase agreements, conduct any merger,
acquisition or investments, amend its articles of association or provide any loans to third parties. The exclusive option agreements will remain effective
until all equity interests in the VIEs held by their nominee shareholders and all assets of the VIEs are transferred or assigned to the Company’s relevant
subsidiaries or its designated representatives.

      Powers of Attorney. Pursuant to the powers of attorney, each of the nominee shareholders of the VIEs, executed a power of attorney to irrevocably
appoint the Company’s relevant subsidiaries or its designated person as nominee shareholder’s attorney-in-fact to exercise all of the rights as a
shareholder of the VIEs, including, but not limited to, the right to convene and attend shareholders’ meeting, vote on any resolution that requires a
shareholder vote, such as the appointment or removal of directors and executive officers, other voting rights pursuant to the then-effective articles of
association of the VIEs and transfer of VIE’s assets. The powers of attorney will remain in force for so long as the nominee shareholders remain
shareholders of the VIEs. The powers of attorney were amended on December 23, 2020, which were extended the life to an indefinite term commencing
from December 23, 2020 and will be terminated in the event that (i) the power of attorney is unilaterally terminated by the Company’s relevant
subsidiaries; or (ii) it is legally permissible for the Company or any of the subsidiaries to hold equity interests directly or indirectly in VIEs or their
designated person is registered to be the sole shareholder of VIEs.

      Equity Pledge Agreements. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, the VIEs and its nominee
shareholders, the nominee shareholders of the VIEs pledged all of their equity interests in the VIEs to guarantee their and the VIEs’ performance of their
obligations under the contractual arrangements. In the event of a breach by the VIEs or the VIEs’ shareholders of contractual obligations under these
agreements, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, as pledgee, will be entitled the right to dispose of the pledged equity interests in the VIEs. The
nominee shareholders of the VIEs also undertake that, during the term of the equity pledge agreements, they shall not dispose of the pledged equity
interests or create or allow any encumbrance on the pledged equity interests. During the term of the equity pledge agreements, the Company’s relevant
subsidiaries has the right to receive all of the dividends and profits distributed on the pledged equity interests. The pledge will remain binding until the
VIEs and their nominee shareholders discharge all their obligations under the contractual arrangements.

1.    Operations (Continued)
      Risks in relation to the VIE structure
       A significant part of the Group’s business is conducted through the VIEs of the Group, of which the Company is the ultimate primary beneficiary.
In the opinion of management, the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and the nominee shareholders are in compliance with PRC laws and
regulations and are legally binding and enforceable. The nominee shareholders are also shareholders of the Group and have indicated they will not act
contrary to the contractual arrangements. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and
regulations including those that govern the contractual arrangements, which could limit the Group’s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements
and if the nominee shareholders of the VIE were to reduce their interests in the Group, their interest may diverge from that of the Group and that may
potentially increase the risk that they would seek to act contrary to the contractual arrangements.

     On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, effective on January 1, 2020. The Foreign Investment
Law has a catch-all provision under the definition of “foreign investment” which includes investments made by foreign investors in China through
means stipulated in laws or administrative regulations or other methods prescribed by the State Council. In the event that the State Council in the future
promulgates laws and regulations that deem investments made by foreign investors through contractual arrangements as “foreign investment,” the
Group’s ability to use the contractual arrangements with its VIEs and the Group’s ability to conduct business through the VIEs could be severely limited.

                                                                          F-16

1.    Operations (Continued)
      Risks in relation to the VIE structure (Continued)
     The Company’s ability to control the VIEs also depends on the powers of attorney the founders have to vote on all matters requiring shareholder
approval in the VIEs. As noted above, the Company believes these powers of attorney are legally enforceable but may not be as effective as direct equity
ownership.

     In addition, if the Group’s corporate structure or the contractual arrangements with the VIEs were found to be in violation of any existing or future
PRC laws and regulations, the PRC regulatory authorities could, within their respective jurisdictions:
       •     revoke the Group’s business and/or operating licenses;
       •     impose fines on the Group;
       •     confiscate any of the Group’s income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations;
       •     discontinue or place restrictions or onerous conditions on the Group’s operations;
       •     restrict the Group’s right to collect revenues;
       •     shut down the Group’s servers or block the Group’s app/websites;
       •     require the Group to restructure the operations, re-apply for the necessary licenses or relocate the Group’s businesses, staff and assets;
       •     impose additional conditions or requirements with which the Group may not be able to comply; or
       •     take other regulatory or enforcement actions against the Group that could be harmful to the Group’s business.

      The imposition of any of these restrictions or actions could result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to conduct its business. In
such case, the Group may not be able to operate or control the VIEs, which may result in deconsolidation of the VIEs in the Group’s consolidated
financial statements. In the opinion of management, the likelihood for the Group to lose such ability is remote based on current facts and circumstances.
The Group believes that the contractual arrangements among each of the VIEs, their respective shareholders and relevant wholly foreign-owned
enterprises are in compliance with PRC law and are legally enforceable. The Group’s operations depend on the VIEs to honor their contractual
arrangements with the Group. These contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and disputes arising out of these agreements are expected to be
decided by arbitration in the PRC. Management believes that each of the contractual arrangements constitutes valid and legally binding obligations of
each party to such contractual arrangements under PRC laws. However, the interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations in the PRC
and their application on the legality, binding effect and enforceability of contracts are subject to the discretion of competent PRC authorities, and
therefore there is no assurance that relevant PRC authorities will take the same position as the Group herein in respect of the legality, binding effect and
enforceability of each of the contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve, the interpretations of many laws,
regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal
protections available to the Group to enforce the contractual arrangements should the VIEs or the nominee shareholders of the VIEs fail to perform their
obligations under those arrangements. Conflicts of interest may arise between the roles of them as shareholders, directors or officers of Group and as
shareholders of the VIEs.

                                                                           F-17

1.    Operations (Continued)
      In accordance with various contractual agreements, the Company has the power to direct the activities of the VIEs and can have assets transferred
out of the VIEs. Therefore, the Company considers that there are no assets in the respective VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the
respective VIEs, except for the registered capital of the VIEs amounting to RMB494.1 million and RMB501.8 million, as of December 31, 2022 and
2023, respectively, as well as certain non-distributable statutory reserves amounting to RMB24.1 million and RMB31.4 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2022 and 2023. As the respective VIEs are incorporated as limited liability companies under the PRC Company Law, creditors do not
have recourse to the general credit of the Company for the liabilities of the respective VIEs. There is currently no contractual arrangement that would
require the Company to provide additional financial support to the VIEs. As the Group is conducting certain businesses in the PRC through the VIEs,
the Group may provide additional financial support on a discretionary basis in the future, which could expose the Group to a loss.


      Liquidity
       The Group incurred net losses of RMB6,808.7 million, RMB7,507.7 million and RMB4,811.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021,
2022 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was RMB2,647.0 million and RMB3,911.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022, respectively, and net cash provided by operating activities was RMB266.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accumulated
deficit was RMB21,479.9 million and RMB26,310.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The Group assesses its liquidity by its
ability to generate cash from operating activities and attract investors’ investments. Historically, the Group has relied principally on both operational
sources of cash and non-operational sources of financing from investors to fund its operations and business development. The Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent on management’s ability to successfully execute its business plan, which includes increasing revenues while
controlling costs and operating expenses, as well as, generating operational cash flows and continuing to gain support from outside sources of financing.
In the past, the Group has been continuously receiving financing support from outside investors. In 2021, the Company successfully listed its Class Z
ordinary shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raising HKD22.9 billion (RMB19.3 billion), after deducting commissions and
offering expenses, and the Company completed an offering of convertible senior notes due December 2026 (the “December 2026 Notes”), raising
US$1,576.6 million (RMB10.1 billion), after deducting commissions and offering expenses. In January 2023, the Company completed an offering of
15,344,000 American depositary shares (the “ADS Offering”). The amount of net proceeds from the Offering (after deducting all applicable costs and
expenses including but not limited to selling commission) is approximately US$396.9 million (RMB2,689.4 million). Shortly thereafter, the Company
completed repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of US$384.8 million (RMB2.6 billion) of its outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due
December 2026 with the aggregate purchase price of US$331.2 million (RMB2.2 billion), which was funded by the net proceeds from the ADS
Offering. And the remaining net proceeds, after deducting selling commissions of the ADS Offering is US$68.8 million. Moreover, the Group can adjust
the pace of its operation expansion and control the operating expenses. Based on the above considerations, the Group believes the cash and cash
equivalents and the operating cash flows are sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations and other commitments for at least the
next twelve months from the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

                                                                          F-20

2.    Significant Accounting Policies
a)    Basis of presentation
     The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

     Significant accounting policies followed by the Group in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized
below.


b)    Principles of consolidation
      The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs (inclusive of the VIEs’
subsidiaries) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.

     Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Company, directly or indirectly, controls more than one half of the voting power, has the power to
appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of the board of directors, or has the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders.

      A consolidated VIE is an entity in which the Company’s subsidiary, through contractual arrangements, has the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, bears the risks of and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity,
and therefore the Company’s subsidiary is the primary beneficiary of the entity.

     All transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs (inclusive of the VIEs’ subsidiaries) have been eliminated upon
consolidation. There is no VIE in the Group where the Company or any subsidiary has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary.

                                                                           F-21
Table of Contents

                                                                      BILIBILI INC.

2.    Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
c)    Use of estimates
      The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with the U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported revenues
and expenses during the reported periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant accounting estimates include, but
are not limited to, determination of the average playing period for paying players, and assessment for the impairment of long-term investments
accounted for using the measurement alternative.


d)    Functional currency and foreign currency translation
       The Group uses Renminbi (“RMB”) as its reporting currency. The Company and several of its overseas subsidiaries use US$ or their respective
local currencies as their functional currency. The functional currency of the Group’s PRC entities is RMB.

       In the consolidated financial statements, the financial information of the Company and other entities located outside of the PRC have been
translated into RMB. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date, equity amounts are translated at historical
exchange rates, and revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as
foreign currency translation adjustments, and are shown as a component of other comprehensive (loss)/income on the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss.

      Foreign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are
included in exchange losses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.


e)    Convenience Translation
      Translations of balances on the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and consolidated
statements of cash flows from RMB into US$ as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 are solely for the convenience of the reader and were
calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB7.0999, representing the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of RMB as certified for
customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on December 29, 2023. No representation is made that the RMB amounts represent or
could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at such rate.

                                                                            F-22

2.    Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
f)    Fair value measurements
      Financial instruments
      Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or
permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

       Accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
             a.     Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
             b.     Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable
                    for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical asset or
                    liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which
                    significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
             c.     Level 3 applies to asset or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
                    measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

      The Group’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, time deposits, accounts receivable, other receivables,
amounts due from/to related parties, short-term investments, accounts payable, short-term loan, accrual liabilities and other payables of which the
carrying values approximate their fair values. Please see Note 22 for additional information.

                                                                              F-23

2.    Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
g)    Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits
      Cash and cash equivalents mainly represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with large reputable banks in the United States of America and
China, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with original maturities from the date of purchase with
terms of three months or less. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, there were cash on hand and demand deposits with terms less than three months
denominated in U.S. dollars amounting to approximately US$866.7 million and US$181.6 million, respectively (equivalent to approximately
RMB6,036.1 million and RMB1,286.5 million, respectively). As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Group had cash held in accounts managed by
online payment platforms such as Alipay and Paypal in connection with the collection of online service fees for a total amount of RMB51.4 million and
RMB43.0 million, respectively, which have been classified as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets.

       As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Group had approximately RMB4,414.9 million and RMB5,632.1 million cash and cash equivalents held
by its PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs, representing 43% and 78% of total cash and cash equivalents of the Group, respectively.

      Time deposits represent deposits placed with banks with original maturities more than three months but less than one year. As of December 31,
2022 and 2023, there were time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars amounting to approximately US$684.6 million, and US$733.5 million,
respectively (equivalent to approximately RMB4,768.0 million and RMB5,194.9 million, respectively).

      The Group had no other lien arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023. Cash that is restricted as to withdrawal or for
use or pledged as security is reported separately on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the restricted cash balance was
RMB14.8 million and RMB50.0 million.


h)    Receivables, net
      The Group’s accounts receivable, amount due from related parties and other receivables recorded in prepayments and other current assets are
within the scope of ASC Topic 326. Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables from advertising customers, and receivables from distribution
channels.

      To estimate expected credit losses, the Group has identified the relevant risk characteristics of its customers and the related receivables and other
receivables which include size, type of the services or the products the Group provides, or a combination of these characteristics. Receivables with
similar risk characteristics have been grouped into pools. For each pool, the Group considers the past collection experience, current economic
conditions, future economic conditions (external data and macroeconomic factors) and changes in the Group’s customer collection trends. This is
assessed at each quarter based on the Group’s specific facts and circumstances. No significant impact of changes in the assumptions since adoption.

                                                                            F-24

i)   Inventories, net
       Inventories, mainly represent products for the Group’s e-commerce business, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on the
consolidated balance sheets. Cost of inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. Adjustments are recorded to write down the cost
of inventories to the estimated net realizable value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as
historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Group takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased.
Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Certain costs attributable to buying
and receiving products, such as purchase freights, are included in cost of inventories.


j)   Property and equipment, net
      Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the
disposal of property and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized on
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

                                                                          F-25

k)    Intangible assets, net
      Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions are recognized as assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the “contractual-
legal” or “separability” criterion. Purchased intangible assets are initially recognized and measured at fair value. Major identifiable intangible assets that
have determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method as follows:

      Licensed copyrights of content              shorter of the licensed period or projected useful life of the content, mainly vary from 1 to 10
                                                  years
      License rights of mobile games              shorter of the licensed period or projected useful life of mobile games, mainly vary from 1 to 3
                                                  years
      Intellectual property and others            1 - 10 years, based on the underlying intangible assets expected to contribute to the future cash
                                                  flows

     If expectations of the usefulness of the content are revised downward, the unamortized cost is written down to the fair value, which establishes a
new cost basis.

                                                                            F-26

l)    Goodwill
       Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from the acquired entity as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. Goodwill is
not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, and between annual tests when an event or
circumstances change occurs that indicate the asset might be impaired. Under ASC 350-20-35, the Group has the option to choose whether it will apply
the qualitative assessment first and then the quantitative assessment, if necessary, or to apply the quantitative assessment directly.

      The Group, therefore, chooses the quantitative assessment directly and performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the
reporting unit with it carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.

       Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning
assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimated fair
value of reporting unit is determined using either an income approach or a market approach, when appropriate. The judgment in estimating the fair value
of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these
estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. The Group as a whole is determined to be one
reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. The Group applied the quantitative assessment and performed the goodwill impairment test by
quantitatively comparing the fair values of the reporting unit to it carrying amounts. The Group determines the fair value of the reporting unit based on

m)    Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill
      Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market
conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life is
shorter than the Group had originally estimated. When these events occur, the Group evaluates the impairment for the long-lived assets by comparing
the carrying value of the assets to an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual
disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets, the Group recognizes an impairment
loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value of the assets.


n)    Research and development expenses
     Research and development expenses mainly consist of payroll-related expenses incurred for the innovation of video function, development and
enhancement to the Group’s websites, platforms of applications, development of online games and the termination of certain game projects.

      For internal use software, the Group expenses all costs incurred for the preliminary project stage and post implementation-operation stage of
development, and costs associated with repair or maintenance of the existing platforms. Costs incurred in the application development stage are
capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life. Since the amount of the Group’s research and development expenses qualifying for
capitalization has been immaterial, as a result, all development costs incurred for development of internal used software have been expensed as incurred.

      For external use software, costs incurred for development of external use software have not been capitalized since the inception of the Group,
because the period after the date technical feasibility is reached and the time when the software is marketed is short historically, and the amount of costs
qualifying for capitalization has been immaterial.


o)    Sales and marketing expenses
      Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional expenses, salaries and other compensation-related expenses to the
Group’s sales and marketing personnel. Marketing and promotional expenses consist primarily of costs for the promotion of corporate image and
product marketing. The Group expenses all marketing and promotion costs as incurred and classifies these costs under sales and marketing expenses.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the marketing and promotional expenses were RMB5,102.9 million, RMB4,051.3 million and
RMB3,131.0 million, respectively.


p)    General and administrative expenses
     General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other compensation-related expenses to the Group’s general and
administrative personnel, professional fees, severance cost, rental expenses and allowance for expected credit losses.

                                                                             F-28

q)    Leases
      The Group recognizes the right-of-use assets recorded in “Other long-term assets” and corresponding short-term leasing liabilities recorded in
“Accrued liabilities and other payables” and long-term leasing liabilities recorded in “Other long-term liabilities” respectively on the consolidated
balance sheets.

       The Group elected to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less, and to not separate non-lease
components from lease components. Under ASC 842, the Group determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets and
liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease terms. The Group considers
only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of lease commencement.

      The Group leases office space under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, which mainly expire at various dates through 2026. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Group’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.3 years and 2.6 years and a weighted
average discount rate of 4.75% and 4.75%, respectively. Future lease payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:

                                                                                                                December 31, 2023

      Operating lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 was RMB177.4 million, RMB275.1 million and RMB198.7 million,
respectively, which excluded cost of short-term contracts. Short-term lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 was immaterial.
Supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases was as follows:

                                                                                                             For the Year Ended December 31,

r)    Share-based compensation
      Share based compensation expenses arise from share-based awards, including share options and restricted share units(“RSUs”) for the purchase of
the Company’s ordinary shares. The Group accounts for share-based awards granted to employees in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation - Stock
Compensation and share-based awards granted to nonemployees in accordance with ASC 505. The Group accounts for share-based awards granted to
non-employees in accordance with ASU 2018-07, which are similar to the model for employee awards.

      For share options for the purchase of ordinary shares granted to employees determined to be equity classified awards, the related share-based
compensation expenses are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values which are calculated using the
binomial option pricing model. The determination of the fair value is affected by the share price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex
and subjective variables, including the expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.

       The Group recognizes the estimated compensation cost of restricted share units based on the fair value of its ordinary shares on the date of the
grant. The Group recognizes the compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, over a vesting term for service-based RSUs.

      For share-based awards granted with service conditions only, share-based compensation expenses are recorded net of estimated forfeitures using
straight-line method during the requisite service period, such that expenses are recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to
ultimately vest.


s)    Employee benefits
      PRC Contribution Plan
      Full time employees of the Group in the PRC participate in a government mandated defined contribution plan, pursuant to which certain pension
benefits, medical care, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to the employees. Chinese labor regulations require that the PRC
subsidiaries and VIEs of the Group make contributions to the government for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees’ salaries, up
to a maximum amount specified by the local government. The Group has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made.


t)    Investments
      Short-term investments
    Short-term investments primarily include financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying assets issued by
commercial banks or other financial institutions and investments in publicly traded companies with the intention to be sold within twelve months.

       In accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, for financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying
assets, the Group elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carries these investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
these investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as “Investment loss, net (including impairments)”.
Fair value is estimated based on quoted prices of similar products provided by financial institutions at the end of each reporting period.

                                                                            F-30

      Short-term investments (continued)
       For investments in publicly traded companies, the Group carries the investments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the
fair value of these investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as “Investment loss, net (including
impairments)”.


      Long-term investments, net
     The Group’s long-term investments primarily consist of equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative, equity investments
accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at fair value.


      Equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative
     For those investments over which the Group does not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair value, the Group records
them at cost, less impairment, and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes (referred to as the measurement alternative).
Under this measurement alternative, changes in the carrying value of the equity investments are required to be made whenever there are observable price
changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

      Management regularly evaluates the impairment of these investments based on performance and financial position of the investee as well as other
evidence of market value. Such evaluation includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investee’s cash position, recent financing, historical financial
performance, financing needs, and industry environment. An impairment loss recognized equals to the excess of the investment cost over its fair value at
the end of each reporting period for which the assessment is made. The fair value would then become the new cost basis of investment.


      Equity investments accounted for using the equity method
      The Group applies the equity method of accounting to account for equity investments and limited partnership in a private equity fund, according
to ASC 323 Investment—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, over which it has significant influence but does not own a majority equity interest or
otherwise control. Under the equity method, the Group initially records the investments at cost and the difference between the cost of the equity investee
and the fair value of the underlying equity in the net assets of the equity investee is recognized as equity method goodwill, which is included in the
equity method investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Group subsequently adjusts the carrying amount of the investments to recognize its
proportionate share of each equity investee’s net income or loss into earnings and cash distributions from investees, after the date of investment. The
Group evaluates the equity method investments for impairment under ASC 323. An impairment loss on the equity method investments is recognized as
“Investment loss, net (including impairments)” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss when the decline in value is
determined to be other-than-temporary.

                                                                           F-31

      Investments accounted for at fair value
       In accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, for financial products with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying
assets and with original maturities greater than one year, the Group elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carries these
investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss as “Investment loss, net (including impairments)”.

      For investments in publicly traded companies with an intention of holding greater than one year, the Group carries the investments at fair value at
the end of each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of these investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss as “Investment loss, net (including impairments)”.


u)    Taxation
      Income taxes
       Current income taxes are provided on the basis of income/(loss) for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are
not assessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions. Deferred income taxes are
provided using the assets and liabilities method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period of change. A
valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more-likely-than-not that some portion of, or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.


      Uncertain tax positions
       In order to assess uncertain tax positions, the Group applies a more-likely-than-not threshold and a two-step approach for the tax position
measurement and financial statement recognition. Under the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained, including resolution of related
appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likelihood of being
realized upon settlement. The Group recognizes interest and penalties, if any, under accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its consolidated
balance sheets and under income tax expenses in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Group did not have any material
unrecognized uncertain tax positions as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The Group also did not expect any
material increase or decrease in unrecognized tax liability within 12 months following the reporting date.

                                                                               F-32

v)    Revenue recognition
      Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration
the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Group identifies its contracts with customers and all performance obligations
within those contracts. The Group then determines the transaction price and allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations within the
Group’s contracts with customers, recognizing revenue when, or as, the Group satisfies its performance obligations. The Group’s revenue recognition
policies effective upon the adoption of ASC 606 are as follows:


      Mobile game services
      Exclusively distributed mobile games

      For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Group primarily generates revenues from the sale of in-game virtual items to enhance
the game-playing experience.

      In accordance with ASC 606, the Group evaluates the contracts with its customers and determines that the Group has a single performance
obligation which is to make the game and the ongoing game related services available to the paying players. The transaction price, which is the amount
paid for in-game virtual items by the paying player, is allocated entirely to this single performance obligation. The Group recognizes revenue from
in-game virtual items over the estimated average playing period of paying players, starting from the point-in-time when related in-game virtual items are
delivered to the paying players’ accounts.

       The Group has estimated the average playing period of the paying players for each game, usually between one to ten months. The Group considers
the average period that players typically play the games and other game player behavior patterns, as well as various other factors to arrive at the best
estimates for the estimated playing period of the paying players. To compute the estimated average playing period for paying players, the Group
considers the initial purchase date as the starting point of a paying player’s lifespan. The Group tracks populations of paying players who made their
initial purchases during the interval period (the “Cohort”) and tracks each Cohort to understand the subsequent churn rate of the paying players of each
Cohort, i.e. the number of paying players from each Cohort who left subsequent to their initial purchases (the “churn rate”). To determine the ending
point of a paying player’s lifespan beyond the date for which observable data are available, the Group extrapolates the historical churn rate to arrive at
an average playing period for paying players of the selected games. If a new game is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is
available, then the Group considers the estimated average playing period of the Group’s other mobile games which has similar characteristics with the
new game. When the Group believes it can reasonably estimate average playing period of new games based on newly available paying players
information, the Group may prospectively apply the change of estimate.

      The Group applies portfolio approach in estimating the average playing period of the paying players for the recognition of mobile game revenue
given that the effect of applying a portfolio approach to a group game players’ behavior would not differ materially from considering each one of them
individually.

        In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-39, the Group assesses whether it acts as the principal or as an agent in the arrangement with each party
respectively. The Group records revenue generated from exclusively distributed mobile games on a gross basis as the Group is acting as the principal to
fulfill all obligations related to the mobile game operations. The Group is responsible for the launch of the games, hosting and maintenance of game
servers, and determination of when and how to operate the in-game promotions and customer services. The Group is also determining the pricing of
in-game virtual items and making a localized version for overseas licensed games.

                                                                          F-33

v)   Revenue recognition (continued)
      Mobile game services (continued)
       Proceeds earned from selling in-game virtual items are shared between the Group and the third-party game developers, with the amount paid to
the third-party game developers generally calculated based on amounts paid by paying players, after deducting the fees paid to the payment channels
and the distribution channels. Fees paid to third-party game developers, distribution channels and payment channels are recorded as “Cost of revenues”
on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.


      Jointly operated mobile game distribution services
      The Group is also offering distribution services for mobile games developed by the third-party game developers. In accordance with ASC 606, the
Group evaluates the contracts with the third-party game developers and identifies the performance obligations as distributing games and providing
payment solution and market promotion service to the game developers. Accordingly, the Group earns service revenue by distributing them to the game
players.

      In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-39, the Group assesses whether it acts as the principal or as an agent in the arrangement with each party
respectively. With respect to the jointly operated licensed arrangements between the Group and the third-party game developers, the Group considered it
does not have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the game services. The Group’s responsibilities are distributing games,
providing payment solution and market promotion service, and thus the Group views the third-party game developers to be its customers. Accordingly,
the Group records the game distribution service revenue from these games, on a net basis based on the ratios pre-determined with the third-party game
developers when the performance obligations are satisfied, which is generally when the paying players purchase virtual currencies issued by the third-
party game developers.

                                                                         F-34

      Valued added services (“VAS”)
      The Group offers premium membership, live broadcasting, comics and other paid contents to the customers.

      The Group offers premium membership services which provide subscribing members access to streaming of premium content in exchange for a
non-refundable upfront premium membership fee. When the receipt of premium membership fees is for services to be delivered over a period of time,
generally from one month to twelve months, the receipt is initially recorded as “Deferred revenue” and revenue is recognized ratably over the
membership period as services are rendered.

       The Group operates and maintains live broadcasting channel whereby users can enjoy live performances provided by the hosts and interact with
the hosts. Most of the hosts host the performance on their own. The Group creates and sells virtual items to users so that the users present them
simultaneously to hosts to show their support. The virtual items sold by the Group comprise of either (i) consumable items or (ii) time-based items, such
as privilege titles etc. Revenues derived from the sale of virtual items are recorded on a gross basis as the Group acts as the principal to fulfill all
obligations related to the sale of virtual items in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-39. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at point-in-time when the
virtual item is delivered and consumed if the virtual item is a consumable item or, in the case of time-based virtual item, recognized ratably over the
period each virtual item is made available to the user, which generally does not exceed one year. Proceeds received from the sales of virtual items before
they consumed are recorded as “Deferred revenue”.

      Under the arrangements with the hosts, the Group shares with them a portion of the revenues derived from the sales of virtual items. The portion
paid to hosts is recognized as “Cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.


      Advertising services
       The Group provides various advertising formats, mainly include but not limited to advertisements appearing on the app opening page, banner text-
links, logos, buttons and rich media, brand advertising, performance-based advertising and native advertisements which are customized according to
advertisers’ needs. The Group determines each format of advertisements which is a distinct performance obligation. Consideration is allocated to each
performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The Group recognizes revenue on a pro-rata basis for each performance obligation,
commencing on the date the advertisements are displayed on the Group’s platform or upon the performance obligations are satisfied, generally when
users click on links.


      Sales incentives to customers
      The Group provides various sales incentives to its customers, including cash incentives in the form of commissions to certain third-party
advertising agencies and noncash incentives such as discounts and advertising services provided free of charge in certain bundled arrangements, which
are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis with customers. The Group accounts for these incentives granted to customers as variable consideration in
accordance with ASC 606. The amount of variable consideration is measured based on the most likely amount of incentive to be provided to customers.

                                                                          F-35

      IP derivatives and others (formerly known as E-commerce and others)
       IP derivatives and others are mainly from the sales of products through the Group’s e-commerce platform, as well as revenues from e-sports
copyright sublicensing. IP derivatives and others are recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, which
generally occurs upon the acceptance of the goods or services by the customers. Pursuant to ASC 606-10-55-39, for arrangements where the Group is
primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, is subject to inventory risk, and has latitude in establishing prices and
selecting suppliers, revenues are recorded on a gross basis. Otherwise, revenues are recorded on a net basis. Cash coupons, granted to the customers for
free at the Group’s discretion, are recorded as a reduction of the arrangement’s transaction price thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized as
the payment is not for a distinct good or service received from the customer in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-25.

      Net revenues presented on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss are net of sales discount and sales tax.


      Other Estimates and Judgments
      The Group estimates revenue of mobile game, VAS from the third-party payment processors in the current period when reasonable estimates of
these amounts can be made. The processors provide reliable interim preliminary reporting within a reasonable time frame following the end of each
month and the Group maintains records of sales data, both of which allow the Group to make reasonable estimates of revenue and therefore to recognize
revenue during the reporting period. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that the Group
believes are reasonable, but actual results may differ from the Group’s estimates. When the Group receives the final reports, to the extent not received
within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month, the Group records any differences between estimated revenue and actual revenue in the
reporting period when the Group determines the actual amounts. The revenue on the final revenue report have not differed significantly from the
reported revenue for the periods presented.


      Contract balances
     Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Accounts receivable represent amounts invoiced, and
revenue recognized prior to invoicing when the Group has satisfied its performance obligations and has the unconditional right to consideration.

      Deferred revenue relates to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and consists of cash payment received in
advance from game players in mobile games, from customers in advertising services, live broadcasting services and other VAS, and e-commerce
platforms. Due to the generally short-term duration of the relevant contracts, the majority of the performance obligations are satisfied within one year.
The amount of revenue recognized that was included in the receipts in advance balance at the beginning of the year was RMB1,993.7 million,
RMB2,583.6 million and RMB2,760.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

                                                                            F-36

      Practical expedients
      The Group has used the following practical expedients as allowed under ASC 606:

       The transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, has not been disclosed, as substantially
all of the contracts have an original expected duration of one year or less.

      The Group expenses the costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less.

      The following table presents the Group’s net revenues disaggregated by revenue sources:

w)    Cost of revenues
       Cost of revenues consists primarily of revenue sharing costs to mobile games developers and distribution channels and payment channels, revenue
sharing with the hosts and content creators, staff costs, content costs, server and bandwidth service costs, depreciation expenses and other direct costs of
providing these services as well as cost of merchandise sold. These costs are charged to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss as incurred.


x)    Related parties
       Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence
over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or
significant influence, such as a family member or relative, shareholder, or a related corporation.

y)    Net loss per share
       Loss per share is computed in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. The two-class method is used for computing earnings per share in
the event the Group has net income available for distribution. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and
participating securities based on dividends declared (or accumulated) and participating rights in undistributed earnings as if all the earnings for the
reporting period had been distributed.

       Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares and potential ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Potential ordinary
shares include ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share options and restricted share units using the treasury stock method and
ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion of the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes using the if-converted method. The
computation of diluted net loss per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive
effect (i.e. an increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts) on net loss per share. Net loss per ordinary share is
computed on Class Y Ordinary Shares and Class Z Ordinary Shares combined basis, because both classes have the same dividend rights in the
Company’s undistributed net income.


z)    Statutory reserves
        In accordance with China’s Company Laws, the Company’s VIEs in PRC must make appropriations from their after-tax profit, as determined
under the accounting principles generally acceptable in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC GAAP”), to non-distributable reserve funds including
(i) statutory surplus fund and (ii) discretionary surplus fund. The appropriation to the statutory surplus fund must be at least 10% of the after-tax profits
calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP. Appropriation is not required if the statutory surplus fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of the
respective company. Appropriation to the discretionary surplus fund is made at the discretion of the respective company.

      Pursuant to the laws applicable to China’s Foreign Invested Enterprises(“FIE”), the Company’s subsidiaries that are FIEs in China have to make
appropriations from their after-tax profit (as determined under PRC GAAP) to reserve funds including (i) general reserve fund, (ii) enterprise expansion
fund and (iii) staff bonus and welfare fund. The appropriation to the general reserve fund must be at least 10% of the after-tax profits calculated in
accordance with PRC GAAP. Appropriation is not required if the general reserve fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of the respective
company. Appropriations to the other two reserve funds are at the respective companies’ discretion.

      The following table presents the Group’s appropriations to general reserve funds and statutory surplus funds for the years ended December 31,
2021, 2022 and 2023:

                                                                                                                 For the Year Ended December 31,

aa)   Noncontrolling interests
      For the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs, noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of the equity
which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company as the controlling shareholder. Noncontrolling interests acquired through a business
combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date, which is estimated with reference to the purchase price per share as of the acquisition
date.

      The noncontrolling interests will continue to be attributed with its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest
balance.


bb) Comprehensive loss
      Comprehensive loss is defined to include all changes in equity of the Group during a period arising from transactions and other events and
circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by shareholders and distributions to shareholders. Accumulated other comprehensive
income, as presented on the consolidated balance sheets, consists of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments.


cc)   Segment reporting
       Based on the criteria established by ASC 280, Segment Reporting, the Group’s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chairman
of the Board of Directors and CEO, who reviews consolidated results of the Group when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance. The Group has internal reporting of revenue, cost and expenses by nature as a whole. Hence, the Group has only one operating segment.
The Company is domiciled in the Cayman Islands while the Group mainly operates its businesses in the PRC and earns majority of the revenues from
external customers attributed to the PRC.


dd) Business combinations
       The Group accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business
Combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities incurred
by the Group to the sellers and equity instruments issued. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable
assets and liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any
noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any
previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss. During the measurement period, which can be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Group may record
adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or
final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded on the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

       In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group re-measures the previously held equity interests in the acquiree when obtaining control at
its acquisition date fair value and the re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss.

                                                                              F-39

dd) Business combinations (Continued)
      For the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs, noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of their
equity which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company.

       If a business combination is under common control, the acquired assets and liabilities are recognized at their historical book value. The
consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquired entities from the earliest date presented or, if more recent, from the date when the
entities first came under common control, regardless of the date of the combination. Consolidated financial statements for prior years would also be
retrospectively adjusted for periods during which the entities were under common control.


ee)   Recently issued accounting pronouncements
      In November, 2023, new FASB guidance requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the
definition of a segment, the method for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. The FASB
issued the new guidance primarily to provide financial statement users with more disaggregated expense information about a public entity’s reportable
segments. The new guidance is effective for calendar year public entities in 2024 year-end financial statements, and should be adopted retrospectively
unless impracticable. Early adoption is permitted.

      In December, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” to expand the
disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual
periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted.

      In March, 2024, the SEC adopted its rules covering climate-related disclosures which require registrants to provide certain climate-related
disclosures in registrants’ SEC filings. The rules require registrants to disclose strategy, governance, risk management, targets and goals, greenhouse gas
emissions, and financial statement effects. The rules provide phased effective dates and transition provisions, with some entities required to adopt most
elements of the new rules as early as 2025.

      The Group is currently evaluating the impact of the above new accounting pronouncements or guidances on the consolidated financial statements.

      Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated
to have an impact on or are unrelated to its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

                                                                            F-40

3.    Concentrations and Risks
a)    Telecommunications service provider
      The Group relied on telecommunications service providers and their affiliates for servers and bandwidth services to support its operations for the
years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 as follows:

                                                                                                            For the Year Ended December 31,
                                                                                                          2021            2022          2023
                                                                                                                   RMB in thousands

b)    Foreign currency exchange rate risk
      The functional currency and the reporting currency of the Company are U.S. dollars and RMB, respectively. The Group’s exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risk primarily relates to cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, short-term and long-term investments, convertible senior notes
and accounts payable denominated in the U.S. dollars. Most of the Group’s revenues, costs and expenses are denominated in RMB, while the
convertible senior notes and a portion of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, short-term and long-term investments, and accounts payable are
denominated in U.S. dollars. Any significant fluctuation of RMB against U.S. dollars may materially and adversely affect the Group’s cash flows,
revenues, earnings and financial positions.


c)    Credit risk
       The Group’s financial instruments potentially subject to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents,
time deposits, restricted cash, accounts receivable, money market funds and financial products (recorded in the short-term and long-term investments)
with variable interest rates referenced to performance of underlying assets issued by commercial banks and other financial institutions. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2023, substantially all of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits were held in major financial
institutions located in the United States of America and China, which management consider being of high credit quality. Accounts receivable is typically
unsecured and is primarily derived from revenue earned from advertising, VAS and mobile game services (mainly relates to remittances due from
payment channels and distribution channels). The following table presents distribution channel and customer that had receivable balance exceeding 10%
of the Group’s accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.

      Equity investments using the measurement alternative
      The Group elects to use measurement alternative for recording equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less
impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes, in accordance with ASU 2016-01. Under this measurement alternative, changes in the
carrying value of the equity investments will be recognized in current earning, whenever there are observable price changes in orderly transactions for
the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For those equity investments that the Group elects to use the measurement alternative, the Group
makes a qualitative assessment of whether the investment is impaired at each reporting date. If a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is
impaired, the Group has to estimate the investment’s fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC 820. If the fair value is less than the
investment’s carrying value, the Group recognizes an impairment loss in “Investment loss, net (including impairments)” equal to the difference between
the carrying value and fair value.

      RMB31.5 million re-measurement loss, RMB152.2 million re-measurement gain and RMB86.7 million re-measurement loss of equity
investments accounted for using the measurement alternative was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

      For equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative as of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded cumulative upward
adjustments of nil and cumulative impairments and downward adjustments of RMB519.7 million.

      For equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative as of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded cumulative upward
adjustments of nil and cumulative impairments and downward adjustments of RMB758.2 million.

      The Group recorded impairment charges for long-term investments of RMB91.5 million, RMB465.6 million and RMB278.9 million as
“Investment loss, net (including impairments)” for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, as the investees’ unsatisfied
financial performance with no obvious upturn or potential financing solutions in the foreseeable future, and the Group determined the fair value of these
investments was less than their carrying value.

      The Company disposes several equity investments of the Group with the carrying amount of RMB10.4 million, RMB493.1 million and
RMB10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The difference between the consideration and their carrying
value was recognized as “Investment loss, net (including impairments)”. RMB0.8 million, RMB171.3 million and RMB3.9 million disposal gain was
recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

       Realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and adequate
future taxable income, exclusive of reversing deductible temporary differences and tax loss or credit carry forwards. The Group evaluates the potential
realization of deferred tax assets on an entity-by-entity basis. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, valuation allowances were provided against deferred
tax assets in entities where it was determined it was more-likely-than-not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

       The following table sets forth the movement of the aggregate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for the periods presented:

10.   Taxation (Continued)
d)    Withholding income tax on dividends
        The EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a FIE to its immediate holding company outside of
China, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the received
dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China, unless such immediate holding
company’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. The Cayman Islands, where
the Company was incorporated, does not have such tax treaty with China. According to the arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion in August 2006, dividends paid by a FIE in China
to its immediate holding company in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate that may be lowered to 5% (if the foreign investor owns
directly at least 25% of the shares of the FIE). The State Administration of Taxation further promulgated Circular 601 on October 27, 2009, which
provides that tax treaty benefits will be denied to “conduit” or shell companies without business substance and that a beneficial ownership analysis will
be used based on a “substance-over-form” principle to determine whether or not to grant the tax treaty benefits.

      To the extent that subsidiaries and VIEs of the Group have undistributed earnings, the Group will accrue appropriate expected withholding tax
associated with repatriation of such undistributed earnings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Group did not record any withholding tax on the
retained earnings of its subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC as most of which were still in accumulated deficit position.

                                                                          F-49

initial conversion price of US$24.75 per ADS) at each holder’s option at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day immediately
preceding the maturity date of April 1, 2026.

      Holders of the April 2026 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their April 2026 Notes in cash on April 1, 2024 or in the
event of certain fundamental changes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The unamortized debt issuance costs were RMB33.4 million and RMB23.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

      The issuance costs of the April 2026 Notes were amortized to interest expense over the contractual life to the maturity date (i.e., April 1, 2026).
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the April 2026 Notes related interest expense was US$7.6 million, US$7.3 million and
US$7.4 million (RMB51.9 million), respectively.

      As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of RMB3,017.3 million (US$426.0 million) of the April 2026 Notes are short-term in nature as the
April 2026 Notes holder had a non-contingent option to require the Group to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their April 2026 Notes within one
year.

      During the year ended December 31, 2021, US$70.6 million in aggregate principal amount of April 2026 Notes were converted, pursuant to which
the Company issued 2,854,253 ADSs to the holders of such Notes. Accordingly, the balance of the notes converted were derecognized and recorded as

Notes may be converted, at an initial conversion rate of 24.5516 ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount (which represents an initial conversion price of
US$40.73 per ADS) at each holder’s option at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity
date of June 15, 2027.

       Holders of the 2027 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their 2027 Notes in cash on June 15, 2023 and June 15, 2025, or

      In November 2021, the Group issued US$1,600 million of December 2026 Notes with an interest rate of 0.50% per annum. The net proceeds to
the Company from the issuance of the December 2026 Notes were US$1,576.6 million (RMB10.1 billion), net of issuance costs of US$23.4 million
(RMB149.6 million). The December 2026 Notes may be converted, at an initial conversion rate of 10.6419 ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount
(which represents an initial conversion price of US$93.97 per ADS) at each holder’s option at any time prior to the close of business on the second
business day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2026. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be,
cash, ADSs or a combination of cash and ADSs, at the Company’s election. Holders of the Notes may elect to receive Class Z ordinary shares in lieu of
any ADSs deliverable upon conversion.

      Holders of the December 2026 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their December 2026 Notes in cash on December 1,
2024, or in the event of certain fundamental changes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

     As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of RMB3,036.4 million (US$428.7 million) of the December 2026 Notes are short-term in nature
because the December 2026 Notes holder had a non-contingent option to require the Group to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their December
2026 Notes within one year.

                                                                           F-52

14.   Convertible Senior Notes (Continued)
     During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of US$768.3 million (RMB5.2 billion) of
December 2026 Notes for a total cash consideration of US$568.6 million (RMB3.8 billion), with the gain of US$ 190.3 million (RMB1,289.5 million).

     During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of US$384.8 million (RMB2.6 billion) of
December 2026 Notes in the amount of US$331.2 million (RMB2.2 billion) funded by the net proceeds from the ADS offering, with the gain of

December 2026 Notes with the aggregate cash purchase price of US$13.0 million (RMB93.3 million) with the gain of
US$1.4 million (RMB9.8 million).

       The Company accounted for the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes as single instruments as debt measured at its amortized
cost, as none of the embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026
Notes were not issued with a substantial premium. The issuance costs were recorded as an adjustment to the debt and are amortized as interest expense
using the effective interest method.

December 31, 2023:

16.   Employee Benefits
      The Company’s subsidiaries and the VIEs and subsidiaries of the VIEs incorporated in China participate in a government-mandated multi-
employer defined contribution plan under which certain retirement, medical, housing and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese
labor regulations require the Company’s Chinese subsidiaries and VIEs and subsidiaries of the VIEs to pay to the local labor bureau a monthly
contribution at a stated contribution rate based on the monthly basic compensation of qualified employees. The relevant local labor bureau is responsible
for meeting all retirement benefit obligations; hence, the Group has no further commitments beyond its monthly contribution. The following table
presents the Group’s employee welfare benefits expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023:

                                                                                                            For the Year Ended December 31,

      Share options
b)    Valuation assumptions
       The Group uses binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share options. The estimated fair value of each share option granted
is estimated on the date of grant using the binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

                                                                                                        For the Year Ended December 31,

17.   Share-based Compensation (Continued)
      Share options (Continued)
(b)   Valuation assumptions (continued)
       The expected volatility at each grant date was estimated based on the annualized standard deviation of the daily return embedded in historical
share prices of comparable peer companies with a time horizon close to the expected expiry of the term of the share options. The weighted average
volatility is the expected volatility at the grant date weighted by the number of the share options. The Company has never declared or paid any cash
dividends on its capital stock, and the Company does not anticipate any dividend payments in the foreseeable future. Contractual term is the remaining
contract life of the share options. The Group estimated the risk-free interest rate based on the yield to maturity of U.S. treasury bonds denominated in
US dollars at the share option grant date.

19.   Commitments and Contingencies
(a)   Commitments
      Convertible Senior Notes
     The Group’s convertible senior notes are to repay the principal amount and cash interests in connection with the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and
December 2026 Notes. The expected repayment schedules of the April 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes and December 2026 Notes has been disclosed in Note
14.


(b)   Litigation
      From time to time, the Group is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently
available information, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, is
reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

       However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and the Group’s view of these matters may change in the future. The Group records a
liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Group reviews the need
for any such liability on a regular basis. The Group has not recorded material liabilities in this regard as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

                                                                              F-59

21.   Segment Information
      Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The
Group’s CODM is Mr. Rui Chen, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.

      The Group’s organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the CODM uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations which
include, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products and technology. The Group’s operating segment is based on such organizational
structure and information reviewed by the Group’s CODM to evaluate the operating segment results. The Group has internal reporting of revenue, cost
and expenses by nature as a whole. Hence, the Group has only one operating segment.

       Substantially the majority of the Group’s revenues are derived from China based on the geographical locations where services are provided to
customers. In addition, the Group’s long-lived assets are substantially all located in and derived from China, and the amount of long-lived assets
attributable to any other individual country is not material. Therefore, no geographical segments are presented.

                                                                         F-61

22.   Fair Value Measurement
      When available, the Group uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of an asset or liability. If quoted market prices are not available,
the Group will measure fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters,
such as interest rates and currency rates. The Group measures investments in money market funds, financial products and equity investments in publicly
traded companies at fair value.

      Equity investments in publicly traded companies. The Group values its money market funds and equity investments in publicly traded companies
using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for securities with identical characteristics, and accordingly, the Group classifies the valuation
techniques that use these inputs as Level 1.

      Financial products. The Group values its financial products investments held in certain banks or other financial institutions using quoted prices for
securities with similar characteristics and other observable inputs, and accordingly, the Group classifies the valuation techniques that use these inputs as
Level 2.

      Accounts receivable, amounts due from/to related parties and other current assets are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair
value due to their short-term nature. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities, short-term loan and other payables are financial liabilities with carrying
values that approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

      The Group measures equity investments accounted for using the equity method at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment charge
were to be recognized. Equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are generally not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.
However, if equity investments without readily determinable fair values were re-measured or impaired during the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2023, they were classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Group estimated the value of the instruments based on valuation
methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date or other unobservable inputs.

      As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, certain equity investments without determinable fair value (Note 9) were measured using unobservable inputs
(Level 3) and written down from their respective carrying value to fair value, with impairment charges of RMB465.6 million and RMB278.9 million
incurred and recorded in “Investment loss, net (including impairments)” for the years then ended.


23.   Restricted Net Assets
       Relevant PRC laws and regulations permit the PRC companies to pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in
accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, the Company’s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs can only distribute dividends upon
approval of the shareholders after they have met the PRC requirements for appropriation to the generically reserve fund and the statutory surplus fund
respectively. The general reserve fund and the statutory surplus fund require that annual appropriations of 10% of net after-tax income should be set
aside prior to payment of any dividends. As a result of these and other restrictions under the PRC laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries and VIEs
are restricted in their abilities to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans or advances, which restricted
portion amounted to approximately RMB6.5 billion or 46.0% of the Company’s total consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2023. Furthermore,
cash transfers from the Company’s PRC subsidiaries to their parent companies outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency
conversion. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to remit
sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to the Company, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations.
Even though the Company currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from the PRC subsidiaries and VIEs for working capital and
other funding purposes, the Company may in the future require additional cash resources from its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs due to changes in business
conditions, to fund future acquisitions and developments, or merely declare and pay dividends to or distributions to the Company’s shareholders.

                                                                             F-62

                                                                      BILIBILI INC.
                                                                 CLAWBACK POLICY

       The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Bilibili Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is
appropriate for the Company to adopt this Clawback Policy (the “Policy”) to be applied to the Executive Officers of the Company and adopts this Policy
to be effective as of the Effective Date.


     1.      Definitions
      For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:
             a)    “Group” means the Company and each of its subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities, as applicable.
             b)    “Covered Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person who served as an Executive
                   Officer at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-Based Compensation and that was Received (i) on or after
                   October 2, 2023 (the effective date of the Nasdaq listing standards), (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer and (iii) at a
                   time that the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association such as
                   Nasdaq.
             c)    “Effective Date” means November 29, 2023.
             d)    “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person during the
                   fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was attained that exceeds the
                   amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been granted, vested or paid to the person had such amount been
                   determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered
                   Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not
                   subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of
                   such Covered Compensation that constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the
                   effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted, vested or
                   paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.
             e)    “Exchange Act” means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
             f)    “Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such
                   accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function
                   (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person (whether or
                   not an officer or employee of the Company) who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. “Policy-making
                   function” does not include policy-making functions that are not significant. Both current and former Executive Officers are subject
                   to the Policy in accordance with its terms.
g)   “Financial Reporting Measure” means (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles
     used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures and may
     consist of IFRS/U.S. GAAP or non-IFRS/non-U.S. GAAP financial measures (as defined under Regulation G of the Exchange Act
     and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act), (ii) stock price or (iii) total shareholder return. Financial Reporting
     Measures need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.
h)   “Home Country” means the Company’s jurisdiction of incorporation, i.e., the Cayman Islands.
i)   “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the
     attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.
j)   “Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years (plus any transition period of less than nine months that is within or
     immediately following the three completed fiscal years and that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) immediately
     preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a Restatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the
     earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if
     Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a
     Restatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement.
     Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on whether or when the Restatement is
     actually filed.
k)   “Nasdaq” means the Nasdaq Stock Market.
l)   “Received”: Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial
     Reporting Measure specified in or otherwise relating to the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the grant,
     vesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.
m)   “Restatement” means a required accounting restatement of any Company financial statement due to the material noncompliance of
     the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including (i) to correct an error in previously issued
     financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as a “Big R” restatement) or
     (ii) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is not material to the previously issued financial statements but
     that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period
     (commonly referred to as a “little r” restatement). Changes to the Company’s financial statements that do not represent error
     corrections under the then-current relevant accounting standards will not constitute Restatements. Recovery of any Erroneously
     Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on fraud or misconduct by any person in connection with the Restatement.
             n)    “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


      2.     Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation
      In the event of a Restatement, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received during the Lookback Period prior to the Restatement (a) that is
then-outstanding but has not yet been paid shall be automatically and immediately forfeited and (b) that has been paid to any person shall be subject to
reasonably prompt repayment to the Group in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy. The Committee must pursue (and shall not have the discretion to
waive) the forfeiture and/or repayment of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy, except as provided
below.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or, if the Committee is not a committee of the Board responsible for the Company’s executive
compensation decisions and composed entirely of independent directors, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board) may determine
not to pursue the forfeiture and/or recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from any person if the Committee determines that such forfeiture
and/or recovery would be impracticable due to any of the following circumstances: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party (for example, reasonable
legal expenses and consulting fees) to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, including the costs that could be incurred
if pursuing such recovery would violate local laws other than the Company’s Home Country laws (following reasonable attempts by the Group to
recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the documentation of such attempts, and the provision of such documentation to Nasdaq), (ii)
pursuing such recovery would violate the Company’s Home Country laws adopted prior to November 28, 2022 (provided that the Company obtains an
opinion of Home Country counsel acceptable to Nasdaq that recovery would result in such a violation and provides such opinion to Nasdaq), or
(iii) recovery would likely cause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of Group, to fail
to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.


      3.     Means of Repayment
      In the event that the Committee determines that any person shall repay any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the Committee shall provide
written notice to such person by email or certified mail to the physical address on file with the Group for such person, and the person shall satisfy such
repayment in a manner and on such terms as required by the Committee, and the Group shall be entitled to set off the repayment amount against any
amount owed to the person by the Group, to require the forfeiture of any award granted by the Group to the person, or to take any and all necessary
actions to reasonably promptly recover the repayment amount from the person, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
including without limitation, Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance thereunder. If the Committee does not
specify a repayment timing in the written notice described above, the applicable person shall be required to repay the Erroneously Awarded
Compensation to the Group by wire, cash, cashier’s check or other means as agreed by the Committee no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such
notice.
      4.      No Indemnification
      No person shall be indemnified, insured or reimbursed by the Group in respect of any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this
Policy, nor shall any person receive any advancement of expenses for disputes related to any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with
this Policy, and no person shall be paid or reimbursed by the Group for any premiums paid by such person for any third-party insurance policy covering
potential recovery obligations under this Policy. For this purpose, “indemnification” includes any modification to current compensation arrangements or
other means that would amount to de facto indemnification (for example, providing the person a new cash award which would be cancelled to effect the
recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation). In no event shall the Group be required to award any person an additional payment if any
Restatement would result in a higher incentive compensation payment.


      5.      Miscellaneous
      This Policy generally will be administered and interpreted by the Committee, provided that the Board may, from time to time, exercise discretion
to administer and interpret this Policy, in which case, all references herein to “Committee” shall be deemed to refer to the Board. Any determination by
the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties. Any discretionary determinations of the
Committee under this Policy, if any, need not be uniform with respect to all persons, and may be made selectively amongst persons, whether or not such
persons are similarly situated.

      This Policy is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as it may
be amended from time to time, and any related rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC or Nasdaq, including any additional or new requirements
that become effective after the Effective Date which upon effectiveness shall be deemed to automatically amend this Policy to the extent necessary to
comply with such additional or new requirements.

      The provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be
unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted and shall automatically be deemed
amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Policy shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded
Compensation under this Policy is not dependent upon the Group satisfying any conditions in this Policy, including any requirements to provide
applicable documentation to Nasdaq.

       The rights of the Group under this Policy to seek forfeiture or reimbursement are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights of recovery, or
remedies or rights other than recovery, that may be available to the Group pursuant to the terms of any law, government regulation or stock exchange
listing requirement or any other policy, code of conduct, employee handbook, employment agreement, equity award agreement, or other plan or
agreement of the Group.


      6.      Amendment and Termination
     To the extent permitted by, and in a manner consistent with applicable law, including SEC and Nasdaq rules, the Committee may terminate,
suspend or amend this Policy at any time in its discretion.
      7.     Successors
      This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all persons and their respective beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal
representatives with respect to any Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to or administered by such persons or entities.
