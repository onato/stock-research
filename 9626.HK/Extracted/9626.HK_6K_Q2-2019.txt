million MAUs sequentially, the highest net addition since 2017, bringing our total MAUs to 110.4 million, representing 30% growth year-on-year. Paired
with strong user growth, our community is becoming more active and engaged. Our DAUs grew 41% year-on-year in the second quarter, reaching a
record 33.2 million and outpacing our MAU growth. As we move into the summer months, we are delighted to see this momentum continue. Looking
ahead, our strategic initiatives are designed to accelerate our targeted user acquisition efforts, enlarge our user base, enhance our content, and enrich
our community to fuel our monetization.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “High user growth and increased revenues marked our second quarter. We are pleased to once
again surpass the high-end of our guidance with an even more balanced revenue mix. Our non-game revenues grew by 162% while non-game
revenues per MAUs increased by 102%, year-on-year. As our monetization efforts progress, we continue to convert more online traffic to paying users.
In the second quarter, the number of MPUs on our platform more than doubled compared to the same period last year, reaching 6.3 million. Our gross
margin also improved to 16.4% from 13.8% sequentially. As we move forward with our growth plan, our focus will be on obtaining high quality growth
while securing adequate return on our investments.”

application offering comic content the Company launched in November 2018. Maoer is a platform that offers audio drama. In December 2018,
Company increased its shareholdings to 80.5% in Maoer Inc., operator of Maoer app. In the second quarter of 2019, Bilibili Comic and Maoer in an
aggregate contributed to 3.7 million of Bilibili’s MAUs.

2 The paying users are calculated by the number of users who paid for games, live broadcasting, premium membership, Bilibili Comics services and
Maoer, after eliminating duplicates of users paid for multiple services other than users of Maoer. The Company adds the number of paying users of
Maoer toward its total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted, in
evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
