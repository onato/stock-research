Recent Development

In accordance with the Central Cyberspace Administration of the People’s Republic of China’s (“CCA”) nationwide inspection of major internet
platforms providing short-video content, the Bilibili mobile app was temporarily removed from certain smart phone app stores from July 26,
2018 through August 25, 2018. The Bilibili mobile app was fully restored on all app stores on August 25, 2018.

The Company intends to fully cooperate with the relevant authorities, and plans to further strengthen its content monitoring procedures and policies.
The Company also plans to conduct a self-inspection by taking a comprehensive review of the content on its platform and double the headcount of
content monitoring personnel.

Outlook

For the third quarter of 2018, the Company currently expects:

         Net revenues to be between RMB1.0 billion and RMB1.04 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions,
and customer demand, which are all subject to change.

1 The Company has adopted ASU No. 2014-09, ''Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”, using the modified-retrospective transition
approach beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s operating results for the three months and six
months ended June 30, 2018 and comparable periods.

2 Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, please
see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set
forth at the end of this press release.

3 The Company has adopted ASU No. 2016-01, ''Financial Instruments," beginning January 1, 2018. The Company anticipates that the adoption of
this new standard might increase the volatility of its investment income, net, as a result of remeasurement of its equity investments. For equity
investments without readily determinable fair value, the Company elected to measure them at cost minus impairment (if any), plus or minus changes
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuers. In the first quarter of 2018,
the Company recorded an investment income of RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million) as a result.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share, in
evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
