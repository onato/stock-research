“We started the first quarter of 2023 on a positive note with a notable improvement in our gross profit and a
significant reduction in our losses,” said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive officer of Bilibili. “We
continue to execute our strategy of prioritizing profitability while fostering a vibrant and highly engaged
community for our users and creators. Led by this approach, our advertising revenues grew by 22% year-over-
year in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, our DAUs increased by 18% year-over-year to 93.7 million and

leverage and achieve a 37% increase in gross profit year-over-year. Our gross profit margin improved to 22%
from 16% for the same period last year. Many of the spending control measures we initiated were effective and
led to a notable reduction in our total operating expenses, including a 30% year-over-year decrease in our sales
and marketing expenses. These measures helped us meaningfully narrow our net loss by 72% year-over-year in
the first quarter. Going forward, our focus will remain on executing these initiatives, further improving our
margins and moving forward on our path to profitability.”

0.3% from the same period of 2022.

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB2.2 billion (US$314.0 million), representing an
increase of 5% from the same period of 2022, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization
efforts, led by an increased number of paying users for the Company’s live broadcasting services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1.3 billion (US$185.2 million), representing an increase of
22% from the same period of 2022, mainly attributable to the Company’s improved advertising product
offerings and enhanced advertising efficiency.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1.1 billion (US$164.8 million), representing a decrease
of 17% from the same period of 2022, mainly attributable to the lack of new game launch in the first quarter
2023.

IP derivatives and others (formerly known as E-commerce and others). Revenues from IP derivatives and others
were RMB510.0 million (US$74.3 million), representing a decrease of 15% from the same period of 2022,

Company had repurchased a total of 2.6 million ADSs for a total cost of US$53.6 million as of March 31, 2023.

In January 2023, the Company completed the offering of 15,344,000 ADSs at US$26.65 per ADS. Shortly after
the completion of the ADS offering, the Company completed the exchange of an aggregate principal amount of
US$384.8 million of its outstanding December 2026 Notes (the “Exchange Notes”) purchased by Goldman
Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. (“Goldman Sachs”) and its applicable affiliate(s), as duly engaged and authorized by the
Company, from the holders of such Exchange Notes in privately negotiated transactions for the issuance of the
Company’s ADSs. The aggregate purchase price of the Exchange Notes in the amount of US$331.2 million was
funded by the net proceeds from the ADS offering.

As of March 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased a total principal amount of US$54.0 million 2027 Notes
and a total principal amount of US$1.2 billion December 2026 Notes for a total cash consideration of US$0.9

The Company’s repurchase programs of its ADSs or convertible senior notes will depend upon a variety of
factors, including market conditions. These programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS,
basic and diluted, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by
excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets
acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business
acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain on repurchase of
convertible senior notes, expenses related to organizational optimization, and termination expenses of certain
game projects. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about
the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and
future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management
in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the
Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or
as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
