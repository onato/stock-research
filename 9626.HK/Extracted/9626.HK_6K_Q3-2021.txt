“We are proud to announce another stellar quarter of quality growth,” said Mr. Rui Chen, the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Bilibili.
“During our peak summer season, user growth surged, engagement levels reached an all-time high, and we continued to expand our topline. In the
third quarter, MAUs and DAUs each grew 35% year-over-year, advancing us toward our 3-year growth goal. Importantly, our community is stickier and
more engaged than ever. Users spent an average of 88 minutes per day on Bilibili, the longest time we have seen in our operating history. Along with
our growth, we are deepening our commitment as a responsible public company. We continue to cultivate an inclusive community, promoting positive
content and engaging in better environmental, social and governance practices. We hope to instill heartening Chinese culture and values across our
community, and bring more ‘Created-in-China’ content to the world.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “We closed the third quarter with record high revenues of RMB5.2 billion, up 61% year-over-year.
Our revenue mix is more balanced and healthier, and we continue to improve monetization across our growing businesses. Motivated by our
expansive brand influence, revenues from our advertising business continued to increase, up 110% in the third quarter to RMB1.2 billion, compared
with the same period in 2020. MPUs also grew to 24 million in the third quarter, up 59% year-over-year, and our paying ratio reached 8.9%. We believe
we are on the right path to achieve our near- and long-term goals, fortified by our strong fundamentals, healthy balance sheet and ample cash
reserves of RMB24.4 billion.”

2020.

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB1,908.9 million (US$296.3 million), representing an increase of 95% from the same
period of 2020, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts, led by an increased number of paying users for the Company’s
value-added services including the premium membership program, live broadcasting services and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1,172.0 million (US$181.9 million), representing an increase of 110% from the same period of 2020.
This increase was primarily attributable to further recognition of Bilibili’s brand name in China’s online advertising market, as well as Bilibili’s improved
advertising efficiency.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB734.0 million (US$113.9 million), representing an increase of 78% from
the same period of 2020, primarily attributable to the increase in sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.

period of 2020.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB1,633.3 million (US$253.5 million), representing a 37% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to increased channel and marketing expenses to promote Bilibili’s app and brand, as well as
promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games and an increase in headcount in sales and marketing personnel.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB474.9 million (US$73.7 million), representing an 87% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in general and administrative personnel, increased share-based

investment loss was RMB724.3 million (US$112.4 million), compared with net investment income of RMB14.2 million in the same period of 2020. The
change was mainly attributable to the fair value change of investments in publicly traded companies.

Net loss. Net loss was RMB2,686.3 million (US$416.9 million), compared with RMB1,100.9 million in the same period of 2020.

related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions and
loss/(gain) on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, was RMB1,622.0 million (US$251.7 million), compared to RMB967.1
million in the same period of 2020.

Basic and diluted EPS and adjusted basic and diluted EPS2. Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB6.90 (US$1.07), compared with

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to various
uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions and loss/(gain) on fair
value change in investments in publicly traded companies, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this announcement.
