average DAUs also reached a new high of 37.6 million, increasing by 40% year-on-year in the third quarter. These exceptional levels of daily user

lines, with revenues from our advertising business, and live broadcasting and VAS business growing 80% and 167% year-on-year, respectively.
Fueled by strong user growth, exceptional content and improved monetization capabilities, we will continue to increase our top line and enhance the

18.9% sequentially, showing our growing leverage. Along with high quality user growth and increased monetization levels, the number of average
MPUs on our platform grew to 7.9 million, an increase of 124% from the same period last year. Looking ahead, we will continue to convert our growing
traffic to paying users, further improve our gross margin and continue to work to achieve sustainable growth.”

Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB1,859.0 million (US$260.1 million), representing an increase of 72% from the same period of 2018.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB933.1 million (US$130.6 million), representing an increase of 25% from the same period of
2018. The increase was primarily due to the increasing popularity of both existing and newly launched mobile games.

Live broadcasting and Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from live broadcasting and VAS were RMB452.5 million (US$63.3 million), representing
an increase of 167% from the same period of 2018, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts, led by increases in the
number of paying users for live broadcasting services, the Company’s premium membership program and other VAS.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB247.2 million (US$34.6 million), representing an increase of 80% from the same period of 2018.
This increase was primarily attributable to the ramp-up of brand advertising and performance-based advertising, driven by further recognition of
Bilibili’s brand name in China’s online advertising market.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB226.1 million (US$31.6 million), representing an increase of 703% from
the same period of 2018, primarily attributable to the increase in sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB1,507.7 million (US$210.9 million), representing an increase of 71% compared to the same period of
2018. Revenue-sharing cost, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB664.6 million (US$93.0 million), representing an increase of 49% from
the same period in 2018.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB351.3 million (US$49.1 million), representing an increase of 80% from the same period in 2018.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses were RMB774.4 million (US$108.3 million), representing an increase of 71% from the same
period of 2018.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB363.9 million (US$50.9 million), representing an 85% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili’s app and brand in
the summer holidays, as well as promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games, increase in headcount in sales and marketing personnel,
and an increase in fulfillment costs associated with Bilibili’s e-commerce stream.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB163.2 million (US$22.8 million), representing a 48% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased personnel-related expenses, increased amortization expense related to intangible assets
acquired through business acquisitions and other increased general and administrative expenses.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB247.3 million (US$34.6 million), representing a 69% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel, increased share-based
compensation expenses, and other increased research and development expenses.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB423.1 million (US$59.2 million), compared to RMB259.0 million in the same period of 2018.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB8.1 million (US$1.1 million), compared to RMB11.4 million in the same period of 2018.

Net loss. Net loss was RMB405.7 million (US$56.8 million), compared to RMB246.1 million in the same period of 2018.

Adjusted net loss3. Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, was RMB343.1 million (US$48.0 million), compared to RMB202.7 million in the
same period of 2018.

Basic and diluted EPS and adjusted basic and diluted EPS3. Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB1.24 (US$0.17), compared to
RMB0.88 in the same period of 2018. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB1.05 (US$0.15), compared to RMB0.72 in the same
period of 2018.

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents,
time deposits, as well as short-term investments of RMB8.4 billion (US$1,174.4 million), compared to RMB5.2 billion as of December 31, 2018.

Outlook

For the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB1.93 billion and RMB1.98 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions,
and customer demand, which are all subject to change.

1 Starting from the first quarter of 2019, the Company counts mobile MAUs of Bilibili Comic and Maoer toward its MAUs. Bilibili Comic is a mobile
application offering comic content the Company launched in November 2018. Maoer is a platform that offers audio drama. In December 2018,
Company increased its shareholdings to 80.5% in Maoer Inc., operator of Maoer app. In the third quarter of 2019, Bilibili Comic and Maoer in
aggregate contributed 6.1 million of Bilibili’s MAUs.

2 The paying users are calculated by number of users who paid for games, live broadcasting, premier membership, Bilibili Comics services and Maoer,
after eliminating duplicates of users paid for multiple services other than users of Maoer. The Company adds the number of paying users of Maoer
toward its total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

3 Adjusted net loss and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures,
please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense related to
intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures
provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and
future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational
decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
