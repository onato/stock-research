gross profit increased by 33% year over year and our gross profit margin reached 26.1%, marking our sixth
consecutive quarter of margin expansion. We also reduced our operating expenses by 17% year over year
during the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year. As a result, our adjusted net loss narrowed by 58% in
the fourth quarter and 49% in 2023, both year over year, putting us on track to achieve our profitability
goal. Moreover, we are delighted to share that we have achieved positive operating cash flow for the full
year of 2023, and we are committed to further improving our financials in 2024.”

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1.0 billion (US$141.8 million), representing a 12%
year-over-year decrease, and a 2% quarter-over-quarter increase. The year-over-year decrease was mainly

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB4.7 billion (US$660.4 million), representing a decrease of
4% from the same period of 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower content costs, server and

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted loss from operations, adjusted net loss, adjusted
net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted and adjusted net loss attributable to the Bilibili Inc.’s
shareholders in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its
business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to
intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired
through business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies,
gain/loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes, expenses related to organizational optimization, and
termination expenses of certain game projects. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall
understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with
respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when
assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them
in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
