“We began the year on a strong note with continued growth of both our user base and topline,” said Mr. Rui Chen, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of Bilibili. “With an increasing number of talented content creators producing diverse, high quality content, along with our expanding
live-broadcasting and comics offerings, we are attracting more users to our platform and gaining substantial traction. For the first quarter, our MAUs
grew by 31% to 101.3 million and our mobile MAUs grew by 39% to 88.6 million, both on a year-over-year basis. At the same time, our user
engagement is higher than ever, reaching a milestone of 30 million DAUs in the first quarter. Looking ahead, our focus for 2019 remains on continued
user growth and enhancing our commercialization capabilities. We have a number of initiatives underway to support this goal, including rolling out new
and diversified games titles, further advancing our live broadcasting and value-added service streams, and progressing our new business initiatives for
our growing community.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “During the first quarter, our total net revenues increased 58% year-over-year reaching RMB1.37
billion, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. We maintained a healthy revenue mix, with our non-games business lines growing by 179%,
year-over-year. As our commercialization strategy progresses, the number of average monthly paying users more than doubled in the first quarter
reaching 5.7 million, particularly across our games, premium memberships and comic businesses. We are also pleased to have successfully raised
approximately US$734 million of net proceeds in our recent capital raise after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by the Company. With these funds, we expect to have sufficient cash reserves to support our growth initiatives.”

First Quarter 2019Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB1,373.5 million (US$204.7 million), representing an increase of 58% from the same period of 2018.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB873.5 million (US$130.2 million), representing an increase of 27% from the same period of
2018. The increase was primarily due to the increasing popularity of mobile game Fate/Grand Order (“FGO”), particularly with the major content
update Chapter 2.0, which was revealed in early February 2019.

Live broadcasting and Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from live broadcasting and VAS were RMB291.7 million (US$43.5 million), representing
an increase of 205% from the same period of 2018, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts, led by increases in the
number of paying users for the live broadcasting services and the Company’s premium membership program.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB112.5 million (US$16.8 million), representing an increase of 60% from the same period of 2018.
This increase was primarily attributable to the ramp-up of brand advertising and performance-based advertising driven by further recognition of Bilibili’s
brand name in China’s online advertising market.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB95.9 million (US$14.3 million), representing an increase of 621% from the
same period of 2018, primarily attributable to the increase in sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 81% to RMB1,184.2 million (US$176.5 million), compared to RMB654.9 million in the same period
of 2018. Revenue-sharing cost, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB551.7 million (US$82.2 million), representing an increase of 65% from
the same period in 2018.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB189.3 million (US$28.2 million), representing a decrease of 11% from the same period of 2018.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses were RMB496.0 million (US$73.9 million), representing an increase of 73% from the same
period of 2018.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB181.5 million (US$27.0 million), representing a 130% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili’s app and brand,
including promotional activities for offline events, as well as promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games, and an increase in headcount in
sales and marketing personnel.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB128.5 million (US$19.1 million), representing a 25% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased general and administrative personnel related expenses and increased amortization
expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, and partially offset by one-time share-based compensation expense with
an IPO condition recorded in the first quarter of 2018.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB186.1 million (US$27.7 million), representing a 76% increase
year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel and other increased research and
development expenses.

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB306.7 million (US$45.7 million), compared to RMB74.3 million in the same period of 2018.

Investment income, net. Investment income, net was RMB82.0 million (US$12.2 million), representing an increase of 222% from the same period of
2018. The increase was primarily due to the gain arising from the disposal of the Company’s interest in one of its investees during the first quarter of
2019.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB8.2 million (US$1.2 million), compared to RMB3.2 million in the same period of 2018.

Net loss. Net loss was RMB195.6 million (US$29.2 million), compared to RMB57.8 million in the same period of 2018.

Adjusted net loss.1Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, was RMB145.4 million (US$21.7 million) compared to RMB3.2 million in the same
period of 2018.

Basic and diluted EPS and adjusted basic and diluted EPS. Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB0.60 (US$0.09), compared to RMB1.73
in the same period of 2018. Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB0.44 (US$0.06), compared to RMB0.94 in the same period of
2018.

Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, as well as time deposits of
RMB3.5 billion (US$519.1 million), compared to RMB4.3 billion as of December 31, 2018.

Recent Developments

On April 5, 2019, the Company completed the offering of US$500 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026 (the
“Notes”), with interest at a rate of 1.375% per year, including US$70 million in aggregate principal amount to cover overallotments.

The Company also closed the concurrent offering of 14,173,813 American depositary shares (the “ADSs”), at US$18.00 per ADS on the same day (the
“Primary Offering”). In addition, certain selling shareholders completed the offering of 6,526,187 ADSs of the Company at the same price.

The Company received a total of approximately US$733.9 million of net proceeds from the Primary Offering and the Notes, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

The Company plans to use the new proceeds from the Primary Offering and the Notes for enriching contents offerings, investing in research and
development, and other general corporate purposes.

Outlook

For the second quarter of 2019, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB1.45 billion and RMB1.49 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions,
and customer demand, which are all subject to change.

1 Adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on
non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations
of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

2 Starting from the first quarter of 2019, we count mobile MAUs of Bilibili Comic and Maoer towards our MAUs. Bilibili Comic is a mobile application
offering comic content the Company launched in November 2018. Maoer is a platform that offers audio drama. In December 2018, Company
increased its shareholdings to 80.5% in Maoer Inc., operator of Maoer app. In the first quarter of 2019, Bilibili Comic and Maoer in an aggregate
contributed to 3.2 million of our MAUs.

3 The paying users are calculated by number of users who paid for games, live broadcasting, premier membership, Bilibili Comics services and Maoer,
after eliminating duplicates of users paid for multiple services other than users of Maoer. We add the number of paying users of Maoer towards our
total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted, in
evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
