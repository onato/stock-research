2021.

Second Quarter 2021 Highlights:

        Total net revenues reached RMB4,495.3 million (US$696.2 million), a 72% increase from the same period in 2020.
        Average monthly active users (MAUs) reached 237.1 million, and mobile MAUs reached 220.5 million, representing
        increases of 38% and 44%, respectively, from the same period in 2020.

        Average monthly paying users (MPUs1) reached 20.9 million, a 62% increase from the same period in 2020.

“Our robust second quarter performance shows that our high-quality user growth strategy is working,” said Mr. Rui Chen, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of Bilibili. “In the second quarter, our total MAUs reached 237.1 million, representing year-on-year growth of 38%. At the same
time, our users remain sticky and engaged, with the average user time spent on Bilibili rising to an impressive 81 minutes per user per day, the most
we have seen in the second quarter throughout our operating history. Having celebrated our 12-year anniversary in June, we are proud to say we have
stayed true to our mission and root, that is to create an outstanding community for our users and content creators, and promote Chinese original
content worldwide. Looking ahead, we hope to take on more social responsibility, increasing our facilitation of social development, bringing more
fulfilling and positive cultural influence to society and introducing more ‘Made-in-China’ content to the world.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “We achieved another quarter of record high revenues of RMB4,495.3 million in the second
quarter, up 72% year-over-year. Our continuous growth was driven by a more balanced revenue mix, particularly from our advertising business, which
grew by over 200% year-over-year, representing 23% of our total net revenues. Our MPUs also grew substantially, reaching 20.9 million and our
paying ratio improved to 8.8%, compared with 7.5% in the same period last year. Our fundamentals continue to be strong with a cash reserve of
RMB27.6 billion to support our long-term growth strategy.”

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB1,634.9 million (US$253.2 million), representing an increase of 98% from the same

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1,049.1 million (US$162.5 million), representing an increase of 201% from the same period of 2020.
This increase was primarily attributable to further recognition of Bilibili’s brand name in China’s online advertising market, as well as Bilibili’s improved
advertising efficiency.

E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB578.0 million (US$89.5 million), representing an increase of 195% from
the same period of 2020, primarily attributable to the increase in sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.

promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games and an increase in headcount in sales and marketing personnel.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB435.9 million (US$67.5 million), representing a 109% increase

uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions and income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, which are non-cash
charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations,
enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics
used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this announcement.

Weighted Voting Rights

Bilibili Inc. (the “Company”) is controlled through weighted voting rights. Each Class Y ordinary share entitles the holder to exercise 10 votes and each
Class Z ordinary share entitles the holder to exercise one vote on all matters that require a shareholder’s vote, subject to Rule 8A.24 of the Hong Kong
Listing Rules that requires certain matters to be voted on a one vote per share basis (the “Reserved Matters”). The Company’s weighted voting rights
structure enables Mr. Rui Chen, Mr. Yi Xu and Ms. Ni Li, holders of the Class Y ordinary shares (the “WVR Beneficiaries”), to exercise voting control
over the Company notwithstanding that the WVR Beneficiaries do not hold a majority economic interest in the share capital of the Company. This
allows the Company to benefit from the continued vision and leadership of the WVR Beneficiaries.

Shareholders and prospective investors are advised to be aware of the potential risks of investing in companies with weighted voting rights structures,
in particular that interests of the WVR Beneficiaries may not necessarily always be aligned with those of our shareholders as a whole, and that the
WVR Beneficiaries will be in a position to exert significant influence over the affairs of the Company and the outcome of shareholders’ resolutions,
irrespective of how other shareholders vote. Prospective investors should make the decision to invest in the Company only after due and careful
consideration.

As of June 30, 2021, the WVR Beneficiaries were interested in a total of 83,715,114 Class Y ordinary shares, representing a total of 73.6% voting
rights in the Company with respect to shareholders’ resolutions relating to matters other than the Reserved Matters (excluding 3,068,854 Class Z
ordinary shares issued and reserved for future issuance upon the exercise or vesting of awards granted under the Company’s share incentive plans).
Class Y ordinary shares may be converted into Class Z ordinary shares on a one-to-one ratio. Upon the conversion of the Class Y ordinary shares, the
Company would redesignate 83,715,114 Class Y ordinary shares and reissue the same number of Class Z ordinary shares, representing 21.8% of the
issued share capital of the Company as of June 30, 2021 (excluding 3,068,854 Class Z ordinary shares issued and reserved for future issuance upon
the exercise or vesting of awards granted under the Company’s share incentive plans).

As of June 30, 2021, Mr. Rui Chen was interested in and controlled through Vanship Limited 49,299,006 Class Y ordinary shares, representing 43.4%
of the voting rights in the Company. Vanship Limited is controlled by a trust of which Mr. Chen and his family members are the beneficiaries. As of June
30, 2021, Mr. Yi Xu was interested in and controlled through Kami Sama Limited 27,216,108 Class Y ordinary shares and 151,100 Class Z ordinary
shares and held 45,000 Class Z ordinary shares in the form of American Depositary Shares, representing a total of 24.0% of the voting rights in the
Company. Kami Sama Limited is controlled by a trust, and Mr. Xu and his family members are the trust’s beneficiaries. As of June 30, 2021, Ms. Ni Li
was interested in and controlled through Saber Lily Limited 7,200,000 Class Y ordinary shares and 908,300 Class Z ordinary shares, representing a
total of 6.4% of the voting rights in the Company. Saber Lily Limited is controlled by a trust, and Ms. Li and her family members are the trust’s
beneficiaries.
The weighted voting rights attached to the Class Y ordinary shares will cease when none of the WVR Beneficiaries have beneficial ownership of any of
the Class Y ordinary shares, in accordance with Rule 8A.22 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules. This may occur:

(i)   upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances set out in Rule 8A.17 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, in particular where a WVR Beneficiary is:
      (1) deceased; (2) no longer a member of our board; (3) deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to be incapacitated for the purpose of
      performing his duties as a director; or (4) deemed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to no longer meet the requirements of a director set out in
      the Hong Kong Listing Rules;

(ii) when a WVR Beneficiary have transferred to another person the beneficial ownership of, or economic interest in, all of the Class Y ordinary
     shares or the voting rights attached to them, other than in the circumstances permitted by Rule 8A.18 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules;

(iii) where a vehicle holding Class Y ordinary shares on behalf of a WVR Beneficiary no longer complies with Rule 8A.18(2) of the Hong Kong Listing
      Rules; or

(iv) when all of the Class Y ordinary shares have been converted to Class Z ordinary shares.


The Company confirms that it has, since its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and up to June 30, 2021, complied with the Corporate
Governance Code set out in Appendix 14 to the Hong Kong Listing Rules to the extent required by Chapter 8A of the Hong Kong Listing Rules.
