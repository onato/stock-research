exceeded our guidance and improved gross margin. Our diverse content library and unique community fuel continuous expansion of our user base.
Both MAUs and DAUs reached record high in the fourth quarter, up 40% and 41% year-over-year, respectively. We are thrilled to see that our platform
is increasingly welcomed by a mass audience. Our 2020 New Year’s Eve Gala event not only exemplified our deep understanding of young people’s
interests, but also impressed generations born in the ’70s and ’80s, and quickly became one of the most talked about New Year’s Eve broadcasts in
China. To further our growth momentum in 2020, we will continue to cultivate a healthy content ecosystem and enhance our community bond. Paired
with our effective user acquisition strategy and improving commercialization capabilities, we are committed to unleashing the great potential of our
expanding online entertainment ecosystem.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili, said, “For the fourth quarter of 2019, our total net revenues surpassed RMB2 billion, up 74%
year-over-year, once again exceeding the top end of our guidance. We continue to convert our fast growing traffic to paying users with diverse
premium content and services. MPUs grew 100% year-over-year, reaching 8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. As our top line expands and
operational efficiency improves, we are delighted to see increasing gross margin for three consecutive quarters, reaching 19.8% in the fourth quarter
of 2019. In 2020, we are positioned to further execute on our growth strategy, with a keen focus on maximizing shareholder value, while maintaining
our high quality growth standards.”

Notes to Unaudited Financial Information

The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial statements and related notes to be included
in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been completed, the
Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of December 31, 2019.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could result in significant differences between the
Company’s audited financial statements and this preliminary unaudited financial information.

Outlook

For the first quarter of 2020, the Company currently expects net revenues to be between RMB2.15 billion and RMB2.20 billion.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to change,
particularly in light of the uncertainties related to how COVID-19 develops.

____________________
1 Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company began counting mobile MAUs of Bilibili Comic and Maoer toward its MAUs. Bilibili Comic is a
mobile application offering comic content the Company launched in November 2018. Maoer is a platform that offers audio drama. In December 2018,
Company increased its shareholdings and acquired majority equity interests in Maoer Inc., operator of Maoer app. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Bilibili
Comic and Maoer in aggregate contributed 7.5 million to Bilibili’s total MAUs.

2 The paying users are calculated by number of users who paid for games, live broadcasting, premium membership, Bilibili Comic and Maoer, after
eliminating duplicates of users paid for multiple services other than users of Maoer. The Company adds the number of paying users of Maoer toward
its total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

3 Adjusted net loss and adjusted basic and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures,
please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense related to
intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures
provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and
future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational
decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
