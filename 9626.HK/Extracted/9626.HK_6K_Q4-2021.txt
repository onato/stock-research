Notes to Unaudited Financial Information

The unaudited financial information disclosed in this press release is preliminary. The audit of the financial statements and related notes to be included
in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021 is still in progress. In addition, because an audit of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in connection with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has not yet been completed, the
Company makes no representation as to the effectiveness of those internal controls as of December 31, 2021.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when the audit work is completed, which could result in significant differences between the
Company’s audited financial statements and this preliminary unaudited financial information.

Share Repurchase Program of the Company and Proposed Share Purchase by Management

The Company announced today that its board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up

prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market
conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The Company plans to fund the repurchases from its existing cash balance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted, in evaluating its
operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions and loss/(gain) on fair
value change in investments in publicly traded companies, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this announcement.
