consecutive quarter of gross profit margin expansion, which reached 29.9% compared with 23.1% in the
same period last year. As a result, our adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss narrowed meaningfully
by 69% and 72%, respectively, both on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, we generated RMB1.75 billion
in operating cash flow in the second quarter, and our deferred revenue balance at the end of June 2024 also
increased by RMB738 million compared with the end of March 2024, driven by strong mobile games and
advertising performances. The solid progress in our financials has put us on the right track toward
profitability and paved the way for sustainable growth in the future. ”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted loss from operations, adjusted net loss, adjusted
net loss per share and per ADS, basic and diluted and adjusted net loss attributable to the Bilibili Inc.’s
shareholders in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business
by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible
assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through
business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, and
gain/loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall
understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with
respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s
operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a
substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
