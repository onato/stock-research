                      Bilibili Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results

SHANGHAI, November 29, 2022 -- Bilibili Inc. (“Bilibili” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: BILI and HKEX:
9626), an iconic brand and a leading video community for young generations in China, today announced its
unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022.

Third Quarter 2022 Highlights:

•   Total net revenues reached RMB5.8 billion (US$814.5 million), an 11% increase from the same period in
    2021.
•   Net loss was RMB1.7 billion (US$241.2 million), narrowed by 36% from the same period in 2021.
•   Average daily active users (DAUs1) reached 90.3 million, a 25% increase from the same period in 2021.
•   Average monthly active users (MAUs1) reached 332.6 million, a 25% increase from the same period in
    2021.
•   Average monthly paying users (MPUs2) reached 28.5 million, a 19% increase from the same period in
    2021.

“In the third quarter, we took steps to shore-up our business foundation and narrow our losses, while continuing
to provide users with the products and services they love,” said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive
officer of Bilibili. “Our DAUs and MAUs each increased by 25% year-over-year to over 90 million and nearly
333 million, respectively. Users remained highly engaged and the average daily time spent on Bilibili reached
a 96-minute record high. While our community remains key to our long-term success, we believe it is essential
to stay adaptive to the increasingly challenging macro environment. Putting profitability first, we will take
additional initiatives to accelerate our monetization and implement cost containment measures including
rationalizing headcount planning and cutting sales and marketing expenses, with our goal set to improve our
margins and narrow our losses.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “Total net revenues increased by 11% year-over-year and
18% quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter. By improving operating efficiency and controlling our expenses,
we expanded our gross margin and narrowed our losses, both on a sequential basis. Sales and marketing
expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 21%, compared with 24% in the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP
adjusted net loss ratio also narrowed by 10 percentage points sequentially. Going forward, we will continue to
implement strict cost control measures, while actively managing our liabilities.”


Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results

Total net revenues. Total net revenues were RMB5.8 billion (US$814.5 million), representing an increase of
11% from the same period of 2021.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1.5 billion (US$206.8 million), representing an increase
of 6% from the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the newly launched mobile
games.

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB2.2 billion (US$310.6 million), representing an
increase of 16% from the same period of 2021, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization
efforts, led by an increased number of paying users for the Company’s value-added services, including the
premium membership program, live broadcasting services and other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB1.4 billion (US$190.5 million), representing an increase of
16% from the same period of 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to further recognition of Bilibili’s
brand name in China’s online advertising market, as well as Bilibili’s improved advertising efficiency.
E-commerce and others. Revenues from e-commerce and others were RMB757.8 million (US$106.5 million),
representing an increase of 3% from the same period of 2021.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB4.7 billion (US$666.3 million), representing an increase of 13%
from the same period of 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher revenue-sharing costs and content costs.
Revenue-sharing costs, a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB2.4 billion (US$335.1 million),
representing an increase of 11% from the same period of 2021.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB1.1 billion (US$148.2 million), representing an increase of 4% from the
same period of 2021.

Total operating expenses. Total operating expenses remained flat at RMB2.9 billion (US$408.1 million),
compared with the same period of 2021.

Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$172.7 million),
representing a 25% decrease year-over-year. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced promotional
spending in the third quarter of 2022.

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB543.4 million (US$76.4
million), representing a 14% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in
general and administrative personnel.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB1.1 billion (US$159.0
million), representing a 43% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in

Loss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB1.8 billion (US$259.9 million), compared with RMB1.9
billion in the same period of 2021.

million in the same period of 2021.

optimization and termination expenses of certain game projects, was RMB1.8 billion (US$248.1 million),
compared with RMB1.6 billion in the same period of 2021.

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2022, the
Company had cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments of RMB23.9 billion (US$3.4
billion).

December 2026 Notes for a total cash consideration of US$197.7 million. In October 2022, the Company
repurchased an aggregate principal amount of US$54.0 million of 2027 Notes for a total cash consideration of

The Company announced in March 2022 that its board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program,
under which the Company may repurchase up to US$500 million of its ADSs for the next 24 months. The
Company repurchased a total of 2.6 million ADSs for a total cost of US$53.6 million as of September 30, 2022.

  Starting from the second quarter of 2022, we count our active users as the sum of active users
on mobile apps and PC ends during a given period. We calculate active users on mobile apps based on the
number of mobile devices (including smart TV and other smart devices) that have launched our mobile apps
during a given period. Active users on the PC ends refer to the sum of valid logged-in users who visit our PC
website at www.bilibili.com and engage in PC application during a given period, after eliminating duplicates.

  The paying users refer to users who make payments for various products and services on our platform,
including purchases in games and payments for VAS (excluding purchases on our e-commerce platform). A
user who makes payments across different products and services offered on our platform using the same
registered account is counted as one paying user and we add the number of paying users of Maoer toward our
total paying users without eliminating duplicates. Starting from the second quarter of 2022, we add the number
of paying users of smart TVs toward our total paying users without eliminating duplicates.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS,
basic and diluted, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by
excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets
acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business
acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain on repurchase of
convertible senior notes, expenses related to organizational optimization, and termination expenses of certain
game projects. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about
the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and
future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management
in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains
(losses) and other items (i) that are not expected to result in future cash payments or (ii) that are non-recurring
in nature or may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the
Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or
as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
