Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted profit/(loss) from operations, adjusted net
profit/(loss), adjusted net profit/(loss) per share and per ADS, basic and diluted and adjusted net profit/(loss)
attributable to the Bilibili Inc.’s shareholders in evaluating its operating results and for financial and
operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses,
amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related
to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in
publicly traded companies, and gain/loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes. The Company believes
that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of
operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial
and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s
operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a
substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
