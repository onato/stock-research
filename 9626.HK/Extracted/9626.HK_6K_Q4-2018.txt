“2018 marked a year of exceptional growth across our business led by the expansion of our diverse content, attracting more users to our increasingly
engaged community,” said Mr. Rui Chen, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Bilibili. “Our user growth has been substantial with
fourth quarter MAUs reaching 92.8 million and mobile MAUs increasing to 79.5 million, representing impressive year-over-year growth of 29% and
37%, respectively. During the fourth quarter, we generated a multitude of high-quality content though our robust PUGV ecosystem and OGV outlets,
including our first self-produced variety show Storyman 2 and series of Bilibili-produced domestic animation. We also expanded our presence in
e-sports and comics, with new premium e-sports streaming offerings and the launch of Bilibili Comic app, both of which cater to Generation Z’s diverse
entertainment needs. Additionally, we considerably strengthened our anime, mobile games content and commercialization capabilities by securing
relationships with market leaders Tencent and Alibaba during the period. As we move through 2019, we will continue to grow our business by adding
best-in-class content to our industry-leading platform, and further increase the bond within our community.”

Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili said, “Our total net revenues increased 57% year-over-year reaching RMB1.16 billion in the fourth
quarter, with advancements in each of our core business divisions. As we execute our commercialization strategy, we are pleased to see a more
balanced revenue mix with increased revenue contribution from our advertising and live broadcasting, and value-added services businesses. This shift
has led to outstanding growth in the number of average monthly paying users, which nearly quadrupled year-over-year to 4.4 million in the fourth
quarter. As our community continues to grow, we see considerable potential for increased monetization in the expanding online entertainment
industry.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss margin and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted, in
evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense
related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial
measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past
performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and
operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not
consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations
and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance
measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP
Results” set forth at the end of this press release.
