DAU/MAU ratio to 28.5%, an improvement from 26.6% in the same period last year. Our community remained
highly engaged, with the average daily time spent per user reaching 96 minutes in the fourth quarter, driving the
total time spent4 on our platform up by 51% from the same period last year. Nowadays, the changing market
environment calls for increased adaptability. As such, we have taken steps to tighten our expenses and streamline
our organization to further prioritize commercialization. Moving through 2023, we will elevate our execution

community for our users.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “For the fourth quarter, total net revenues reached RMB6.1
billion, gross margin improved to 20.3%, and we further narrowed our adjusted net loss by 21% year-on-year
and 26% quarter-on-quarter, respectively. Notably, we reduced our sales and marketing expenses by 28% year-
on-year while continuing to grow our DAUs. Since October 2022, we have taken a more active stance toward
balance sheet management through convertible senior notes repurchases. As a result, during the period of
October 2022 to January 2023, we reduced the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior
notes by US$932 million. Looking ahead, we will maintain strict cost control measures as we continue to
improve our margins and further narrow our losses.”

Recent Developments

On January 11, 2023, the Company completed an offering of 15,344,000 American depositary shares, each
representing one Class Z ordinary share, par value US$0.0001 per share of the Company (the “ADS Offering”),
at US$26.65 per ADS. Shortly thereafter, the Company completed the exchange of an aggregate principal
amount of US$384.8 million of its outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due December 2026 (the
“Exchange Notes”) purchased by Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. and its applicable affiliate(s), as duly engaged
and authorized by the Company, from the holders of such Exchange Notes in privately negotiated transactions
for the Company’s issuance of ADSs. The aggregate purchase price of the Exchange Notes in the amount of
US$331.2 million was funded by the net proceeds from the ADS Offering. The Company plans to use the
remaining net proceeds (after deducting selling commissions) of the ADS Offering in the amount of US$68.8
million to replenish its cash reserve after its repurchases of certain convertible senior notes in the fourth quarter
of 2022 and for other working capital purposes.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and per ADS,
basic and diluted, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by
excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets
acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business
acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, gain on repurchase of
convertible senior notes, expenses related to organizational optimization, and termination expenses of certain
game projects. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about
the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and
future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management
in its financial and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the
Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or
as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
