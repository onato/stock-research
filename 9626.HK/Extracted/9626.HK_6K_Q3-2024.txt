"This quarter, we sustained strong growth momentum across our community metrics and key business lines,”
said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive officer of Bilibili. “Both DAUs and MAUs hit record
highs of 107 million and 348 million, respectively. Users' average daily time spent also reached a new high
of 106 minutes, increasing by 6 minutes compared to the same period last year. With our thriving
community and highly engaged user base, we are well-positioned to tap into greater user value through our
diverse commercial offerings. Total revenues in the third quarter came in at RMB7.31 billion, increasing
by 26% year over year. In particular, revenues from our mobile games and advertising businesses increased
by 84% and 28% year over year, respectively. With our consistent effort in improving commercialization
efficiency, we achieved our first non-GAAP net profit in this quarter. This milestone is just a new starting
point. Going forward, we will further develop our commercial capabilities while reinforcing our community
ecosystem, bringing long-term value to all of our stakeholders.”

Mr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, "In the third quarter, robust growth in our high-margin
mobile games and advertising businesses accelerated our total revenue growth and significantly expanded
our margins. Our gross profit surged by 76% year on year and our gross profit margin rose considerably to
34.9%, up from 25.0% in the same period last year. Consequently, we recorded an adjusted operating profit
of RMB272.2 million compared with a loss of RMB755.4 million from the same period of 2023. The
significant improvement in our financials showed the elasticity of our business model, as well as the vast
commercialization potential within our community. We will build on this landmark and continue to drive
sustainable growth in the future."

Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from VAS were RMB2.82 billion (US$402.0 million), representing
an increase of 9% from the same period of 2023, led by increases in revenues from live broadcasting and
other value-added services.

Advertising. Revenues from advertising were RMB2.09 billion (US$298.5 million), representing an
increase of 28% from the same period of 2023, mainly attributable to the Company’s improved advertising
product offerings and enhanced advertising efficiency.

Mobile games. Revenues from mobile games were RMB1.82 billion (US$259.7 million), representing an
increase of 84% from the same period of 2023, mainly attributable to the strong performance of the

million), representing a decrease of 2% from the same period of 2023.

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues was RMB4.76 billion (US$678.1 million), representing an increase of
9% from the same period of 2023. The increase was mainly due to higher revenue-sharing costs and was
partially offset by lower content costs. Revenue-sharing costs, a key component of cost of revenues, were
RMB2.91 billion (US$414.8 million), representing an increase of 19% from the same period of 2023,
mainly due to the increase of mobile games-related revenue-sharing costs.

Gross profit. Gross profit was RMB2.55 billion (US$363.0 million), representing an increase of 76% from
the same period of 2023, mainly attributable to the growth in total net revenues, while costs related to

representing an increase of 2% from the same period of 2023.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB906.1 million

from the same period of 2023.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted profit/(loss) from operations, adjusted net
profit/(loss), adjusted net profit/(loss) per share and per ADS, basic and diluted and adjusted net profit/(loss)
attributable to the Bilibili Inc.’s shareholders in evaluating its operating results and for financial and
operational decision-making purposes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help
identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses,
amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related
to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in
publicly traded companies, and gain/loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes. The Company believes
that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of
operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial
and operational decision-making.

The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s
operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a
substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the
Company’s performance.

For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited
Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”
