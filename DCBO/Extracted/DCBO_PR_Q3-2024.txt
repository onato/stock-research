Docebo Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results


TORONTO, ONTARIO - November 8, 2024 - Docebo Inc. (NASDAQ: DCBO; TSX:DCBO) (“Docebo” or the “Company”), a leading learning platform provider with a foundation in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation, announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. All amounts are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated.

“We surpassed our Q3 targets in both revenue and profitability, showcasing our continued leadership in automating learning outcomes for our customers." said Alessio Artuffo, President and CEO. "At Docebo Inspire, our largest customer event, we showcased our commitment to AI-driven innovation by unveiling cutting-edge applications and enhanced analytics. These advancements, offering a highly personalized learner experience, solidify Docebo's position as a disruptive leader in learning technology."


Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights

•Total revenue of $55.4 million, an increase of 19% from the comparative period in the prior year.
•Gross profit of $45.0 million, an increase of 19% from the comparative period in the prior year, represented 81.1% of revenue in line with the comparative period in the prior year.

•Adjusted Net Income1 of $8.3 million, or Adjusted Earnings per share of $0.27, compared to Adjusted Net Income of $5.0 million, or Adjusted Earnings per share of $0.15 for the comparative period in the prior year.
•Annual Recurring Revenue1 as at September 30, 2024 of $214.1 million, an increase of $32.3 million from $181.8 million as at the end of the third quarter of 2023, or an increase of 18%, including the positive impact of approximately 2 percentage points given the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.
•Adjusted EBITDA1 of $8.7 million, representing 15.7% of total revenue, compared to $4.5 million, representing 9.7% of total revenue, for the comparative period in the prior year.

The decrease was driven by the adoption and payout of semi-annual bonuses and the timing of payments to vendors. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Free Cash Flow improved to 13.9% of total revenue, up from 10.0% in the same period last year.

•Tumi Holdings, Inc., a manufacturer of high-end luxury and performance suitcases and bags for travel, chose Docebo to consolidate multiple CX and EX use cases across their global operations that span North America, APAC, Europe and China.

•A large and growing US-based furniture store known for their fast time-to-deliver and product availability, chose Docebo to be their learning solutions partner as they address retail, distribution and corporate training requirements.

•A US-based major fast food company with operations in North American and the United Kingdom that has been a Docebo customer since 2022, expanded their use of our EX learning technology solutions as part of their larger initiative to increase their employees’ product knowledge, improving employee on the job satisfaction, and reducing costly employee turnover.
•The world’s leading event and exhibition organizer expanded their use of Docebo’s learning platform to support first responder firefighter and EMS training in fire departments across the US.

Financial Outlook

Docebo is providing financial guidance for the three months ended December 31, 2024 as follows:

•Total revenue between $56.0 million and $56.2 million
•Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue between 16.5% to 16.7%

Management expects subscription revenue to grow about two percentage points higher than overall company revenue while professional services revenue to be down sequentially from Q3.

Docebo is raising financial guidance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:

•Total revenue growth of approximately 19.5%
•Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 15.5%

The information in this section is forward-looking. Please see the sections entitled “Non-IFRS Measures and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures” and “Key Performance Indicators” in this press release for how we define “Adjusted EBITDA” and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Information.” A reconciliation of forward-looking “Adjusted EBITDA” to the most directly comparable IFRS measure is not available without unreasonable effort, as certain items cannot be reasonably predicted because of their high variability, complexity and low visibility. Docebo believes that this type of guidance provides useful insight into the anticipated performance of its business.

Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts but instead represent management’s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events or circumstances.

This forward-looking information in this press release includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding the Company’s business; the guidance for the three months ended December 31, 2024 in respect of total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue and subscription revenue and fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 in respect of total revenue growth, and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue discussed under “Financial Outlook” in this press release; the expanded use of AI across our platform; future financial position and business strategy; the learning management industry; our growth rates and growth strategies; addressable markets for our solutions; the achievement of advances in and expansion of our platform; expectations regarding our revenue and the revenue generation potential of our platform and other products; our business plans and strategies; and our competitive position in our industry.

Forward-looking information is necessarily based on a number of opinions, estimates and assumptions that, while considered by the Company to be appropriate and reasonable as of the date of this press release, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to:

•the Company’s ability to execute its growth strategies;

Our guidance for the three months ended December 31, 2024 in respect of total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue and subscription revenue and fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 in respect of total revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue is subject to certain assumptions and associated risks as stated under “Forward-Looking Statements,” and in particular the following:
•currency assumptions, in particular that the US dollar will remain strong against other major currencies;
•there will be continued macro-economic headwinds that will specifically affect our SMB and lower mid-market customers;
•there will be a seven-figure negative impact on our Annual Recurring Revenue base resulting from a large enterprise customer terminating its agreement with us following its acquisition of an organization that has an in-house LMS;
•our ability to win business from new customers and expand business from existing customers;
•the timing of new customer wins and expansion decisions by our existing customers;
•maintaining our customer retention levels, and specifically, that customers will renew contractual commitments on a periodic basis as those commitments come up for renewal, at rates not materially inconsistent with our historical experience; and
•with respect to Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, our ability to contain expense levels while expanding our business.

If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the opinions, estimates or assumptions underlying the forward-looking information prove incorrect, actual results or future events might vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking information. The opinions, estimates or assumptions referred to above and described in greater detail in the “Summary of Factors Affecting our Performance” section of our MD&A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in the “Risk Factors” section of our AIF, should be considered carefully by prospective investors.

Although we have attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other risk factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking information. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information, which speaks only as of the date made. The forward-looking information contained in this press release represents our expectations as of the date specified herein, and are subject to change after such date. However, we disclaim any intention or obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities laws.

All of the forward-looking information contained in this press release is expressly qualified by the foregoing cautionary statements.

Non-IFRS Measures and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures

This press release makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures including key performance indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors in the software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) industry. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with alternative measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying
6


solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures, including SaaS industry metrics, in the evaluation of companies in the SaaS industry. Management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, the preparation of annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. The non-IFRS measures referred to in this press release include “Annual Recurring Revenue”, “Average Contract Value”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Net Income”, “Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted”, “Working Capital” and “Free Cash Flow”.


Key Performance Indicators

We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period under the provisions of our agreements with customers. The terms of our agreements, combined with high customer retention rates, provides us with a significant degree of visibility into our near-term revenues. Management uses a number of metrics, including the ones identified below, to measure the Company’s performance and customer trends, which are used to prepare financial plans and shape future strategy. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies.


•Annual Recurring Revenue: We define Annual Recurring Revenue as the annualized equivalent value of the subscription revenue of all existing contracts (including Original Equipment Manufacturer contracts) as at the date being measured, excluding non-recurring revenues from implementation, support and maintenance fees. Our customers generally enter into annual or multi-year contracts which are non-cancellable or cancellable with penalty. Accordingly, our calculation of Annual Recurring Revenue assumes that customers will renew the contractual commitments on a periodic basis as those commitments come up for renewal. Subscription agreements may be subject to price increases upon renewal reflecting both inflationary increases and the additional value provided by our solutions. In addition to the expected increase in subscription revenue from price increases over time, existing customers may subscribe for additional features, learners or services during the term. We believe that this measure provides a fair real-time measure of performance in a subscription-based environment. Annual Recurring Revenue provides us with visibility for consistent and predictable growth to our cash flows. Our strong total revenue growth coupled with increasing Annual Recurring Revenue indicates the continued strength in the expansion of our business and will continue to be our focus on a go-forward basis.

•Average Contract Value: Average Contract Value is calculated as total Annual Recurring Revenue divided by the number of active customers.



Annual Recurring Revenue and Average Contract Value as at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding net finance income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, other income, foreign exchange gains and losses, acquisition related compensation, transaction related expenses and restructuring costs, if any.

The IFRS measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA presented in our financial statements is net income.
