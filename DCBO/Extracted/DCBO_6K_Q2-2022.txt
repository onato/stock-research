Basis of preparation


Statement of compliance

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared by management using the same accounting policies and methods as those used in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in compliance with IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, certain disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”) have been omitted or condensed. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

These financial statements were approved and authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors of the Company on August 10, 2022.


Use of estimates, assumptions and judgments

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

DOCEBO INC.
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2022
(expressed in thousands of US dollars, except share amounts)
Estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, with its combined health toll and sharp decline in global economic output, is unprecedented and the full extent of the impact continues to depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning its severity, its duration and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or manage its impact. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 and measures taken to contain the virus on our results of operations and overall financial performance continues to remain uncertain.


In preparing these financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key sources of uncertainty are the same as those applied and described in the Company’s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

On January 21, 2022, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Skillslive for total consideration, including a working capital adjustment, of $1,071. The acquisition of Skillslive will contribute to the expansion of the Company’s footprint in Australia and accelerate time-to-market by immediately adding specialized talent and infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) region.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method whereby the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. No identifiable intangible assets were acquired in connection with the acquisition of Skillslive. Goodwill arising on the acquisition reflects the benefits attributable to synergies and the estimated fair value of an assembled workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they did not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. This goodwill is not deductible for income taxes.

1 In March 2021, the Company granted stock options to certain executives. Subsequently, the Company identified an error in determining the expected life and volatility inputs used in the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of options, which led to the Company determining that 63,992 excess options were granted in March 2021 to six senior executives (the “Awardees”). The granting of excess options was immaterial to the Company but the error resulted in an award of options to the Awardees that was not reasonable and appropriate to grant. During 2021, the Company amended and restated the option award agreements for those affected Awardees to reflect the issuance of the appropriate number of options.

The Company has three categories of potentially dilutive securities outstanding: stock options, DSUs and RSUs. All potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the periods in which the Company is in a net loss position. Including the dilutive securities in these periods would be anti-dilutive; therefore, basic and diluted number of shares used in the calculation is the same for the periods presented.

The weighted average outstanding number and type of securities that could potentially dilute basic net income per share in the future but would have decreased the loss per share (anti-dilutive) for the periods in which the Company is in a net loss position are as follows:

Financial instruments and risk management


Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from deposits with banks and outstanding receivables. The Company trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. Due to the Company’s diversified customer base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. Potential effects from COVID-19 on the Company’s credit risk have been considered and have resulted in increases to its allowances for expected credit losses on customer balances. The Company continues its assessment given the fluidity of COVID-19’s global impact.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and borrowings approximate fair values due to the short-term nature of these items or being carried at fair value or, for borrowings, the interest rates charged approximate current market rates. The risk of material change in fair value is not considered to be significant. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk.

Contingent consideration is classified as a Level 3 financial instrument. The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated using discounted cash flows. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, there were no transfers of amounts between levels in the fair value hierarchy.








18
Segment information

The Company reports segment information based on internal reports used by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make operating and resource allocation decisions and to assess performance. The CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes decisions and assesses performance of the Company on a consolidated basis such that the Company is a single reportable operating segment.
