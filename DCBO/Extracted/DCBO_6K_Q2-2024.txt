Basis of preparation


Statement of compliance

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared by management using the same accounting policies and methods as those used in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, certain disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) have been omitted or condensed. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

These financial statements were approved and authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors of the Company on August 7, 2024.

liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

In preparing these financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key sources of uncertainty are the same as those applied and described in the Company’s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Financial instruments and risk management


Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from deposits with banks and outstanding receivables. The Company trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. Due to the Company’s diversified customer base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables approximate fair values due to the short-term nature of these items or being carried at fair value. The risk of material change in fair value is not considered to be significant. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no transfers of amounts between levels in the fair value hierarchy.








18
Segment information

The Company reports segment information based on internal reports used by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make operating and resource allocation decisions and to assess performance. The CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes decisions and assesses performance of the Company on a consolidated basis such that the Company is a single reportable operating segment.
