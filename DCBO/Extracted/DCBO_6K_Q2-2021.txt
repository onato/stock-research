Nature of business

Docebo Inc. (the “Company” or “Docebo”) is a provider of cloud-based learning management systems. The Company was incorporated on April 21, 2016 under the laws of the Province of Ontario. The Company’s head office is located at Suite 701, 366 Adelaide Street West, Toronto, M5V 1R9, Canada.

The Company’s shares are listed on both the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”), as of October 8, 2019, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the “Nasdaq”), as of December 3, 2020, under the stock symbol “DCBO”.

The impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, with its combined health toll and sharp decline in global economic output, is unprecedented and the full extent of the impact will depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning its severity, its duration and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or manage its impact.

In response to the pandemic, we have modified our business practices with a focus on the health and well-being of our workforce both in Europe and North America which is now working remotely where required by local law or regulation and has been, depending on personal preferences and circumstances, provided with the flexibility to continue working remotely when such laws or regulations are lifted. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 and measures taken to contain the virus on our results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.

Basis of preparation


Statement of compliance

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared by management using the same accounting policies and methods as those used in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in compliance with IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, certain disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”) have been omitted or

DOCEBO INC.
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(expressed in thousands of US dollars, except share amounts)
condensed. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

These financial statements were approved and authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors of the Company on August 11, 2021.


Use of estimates, judgments and assumptions

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.


In preparing these financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key sources of uncertainty are the same as those applied and described in the Company’s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.








3
Summary of significant accounting policies


In preparing these financial statements, the significant accounting policies applied in these financial statements are the same as those applied and described in the Company’s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, except as described below.


Change in accounting policy

In March 2021, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) finalized an agenda decision which clarified the customer’s accounting for configuration and customization in a cloud computing arrangement. As a result of this decision, in Q1 2021, the Company changed its accounting policy for costs incurred for cloud computing arrangements with retrospective application. As a result of the change, intangible assets of $362 were derecognized with a corresponding increase to deficit as of December 31, 2020. There was no impact to operating expenses or net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as a result of this change. The impact of the change for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an increase to research and development costs of $384 and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of $22. The impact on net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an increase of $362.








4
Business combination

On October 30, 2020, Docebo acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of forMetris, a leading SaaS-based learning impact evaluation platform based in Paris, France. Total consideration of $6,417, which includes the estimated amounts of contingent consideration, consisted of $2,624 cash paid on the closing date and the issuance of 29,024 Common Shares of the Company for consideration of $1,163, at a fair value of C$53.38 per share at the closing date, which is based on the quoted price of the Common Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the closing date. The fair value of the contingent consideration of $2,630 (maximum undiscounted payable of $2,803) is payable contingent on the performance of agreed revenue milestones in each of the next three years. In addition, compensation expense is being recorded for one employee of the acquiree who is entitled to payments of up to $2,447 over the next three years based on the achievement of both yearly performance milestones and continued

employment. The contingent consideration and the employee compensation expense installments are to be paid by a combination of 20% in cash and 80% in shares of the Company (subject to any required regulatory approvals).

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method whereby the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on management’s best estimates of the fair values as at October 30, 2020. As at March 31, 2021, the Company finalized the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date which led to a revised assessment of trade and other payables resulting in a reduction of $102 to goodwill compared to the previously estimated amounts reported in the 2020 financial statements.

The following table summarizes the allocations of the consideration paid and the amounts of fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:

Goodwill arising on the acquisition reflects the benefits attributable to synergies, revenue growth, future market development and the fair value of an assembled workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they did not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. This goodwill is not deductible for income taxes.

Contingent consideration comprises earn-out payments due to sellers for meeting certain revenue conditions over the three years following the date of acquisition. The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated using discounted cash flows and was $2,630 as at the date of acquisition. The fair value of the contingent consideration as at June 30, 2021 was $2,666 (December 31, 2020 - $2,630); $467 (December 31, 2020 - nil) will be paid in the first quarter of 2022 if the acquiree achieves its performance milestones for the fiscal year 2021. The Company incurred interest accretion in relation to the contingent consideration for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 of $18 and $36, respectively.

Credit Facility

On July 25, 2019, the Company secured a committed revolving term credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) from the Toronto-Dominion Bank. Upon the closing of initial public offering on October 8, 2019, the commitment was increased to $15,000. The amount available to be drawn under the Credit Facility from time to time is equal to the lesser of (i) the commitment and (ii) an amount equal to the trailing one-month consolidated recurring revenue of the Company (“MRR”) multiplied by six multiplied by the trailing twelve month gross retention rate percentage on MRR (which rate shall not exceed 100%), minus the amount of any statutory prior claims then in existence. The Credit Facility will mature on July 25, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”).

Loss per share
The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive securities: stock options and DSUs. All potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for all periods presented given the Company is in a net loss position during those periods. Including the dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive; therefore, basic and diluted number of shares used in the calculation is the same for the periods presented.

The outstanding number and type of securities that could potentially dilute basic net loss per share in the future but would have decreased the loss per share (anti-dilutive) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

Financial instruments and risk management


Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from deposits with banks and outstanding receivables. The

14

DOCEBO INC.
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2021
(expressed in thousands of US dollars, except share amounts)
Company trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. Due to the Company’s diversified customer base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. There are no receivables from individual customers for 10% or more of revenues or receivables. Potential effects from COVID-19 on the Company’s credit risk have been considered and have resulted in increases to its allowances for expected credit losses on customer balances. The Company continues its assessment given the fluidity of COVID-19’s global impact.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and borrowings approximate fair values due to the short-term nature of these items. The items being carried at fair value or the interest rates charged approximate current market rates. The risk of material change in fair value is not considered to be significant. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk.

Contingent consideration is classified as a Level 3 financial instrument. The valuation method and significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration has been disclosed in Note 4. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, there were no transfers of amounts between levels in the fair value hierarchy.








19
Segment information

The Company reports segment information based on internal reports used by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make operating and resource allocation decisions and to assess performance. The CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes decisions and assesses performance of the Company on a consolidated basis such that the Company is a single reportable operating segment.
