Our produce business
Select excellence from orchard to market

Seeka grows, processes and supplies premium, healthy fruit to domestic and international consumers. We are
founded on kiwifruit and have expanded to be New Zealand and Australia’s largest kiwifruit grower. We also
grow and supply New Zealand kiwiberry, avocados and citrus and Australian nashi, pears and other fruits.
We supply Zespri with premium New Zealand kiwifruit, while also servicing key retail customers in New Zealand, Australia and other
international markets. We also sell fresh produce from our Auckland wholesale market.
We are a large regional employer, operating packing and coolstore facilities in all major kiwifruit and avocado growing regions in New
Zealand’s North Island. Seeka also operates orchard and post harvest facilities in Victoria Australia, with Australians buying Seekasupplied fruit all year round.
We deliver excellence in supply chain management, and have extended our services to import and condition tropical fruits for New
Zealand retailers, plus we produce and sell avocado oil and the digestive aid Kiwi Crush.
At Seeka, we deliver excellence from orchard to market.

Seeka KKP post harvest facility and adjoining kiwifruit orchards near Maketu in the Bay of Plenty. KKP is one of 12 post harvest facilities
operated by the Seeka Group; 11 in New Zealand and one in Australia. KKP is currently being upgraded with a highly-automated packline
and new energy-efficient coolstores that use environmentally-friendly coolant are being built at neighbouring Transcool.
This $20 million investment is expected to deliver sufficient post harvest capacity through to 2024.

Chair and Chief Executive's report

We are pleased to present Seeka’s results and commentary for the financial year to 31 December 2021.
2021 was a busy year. Seeka increased our regional services with the acquisition of Ōpōtiki Packing and
Coolstorage Limited (OPAC) and Kerikeri-based Orangewood Limited (Orangewood), and in December
announced the acquisition of Gisborne-based NZ Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits), with the acquisition
completed 2 February 2022.
These regional acquisitions increase Seeka’s market share
in our foundation kiwifruit business to approximately 26%.
Integration of the acquired companies is complete and steps
taken to deliver all forecast synergy gains. While increasing
Seeka's scale and regional presence, these acquisitions are
accretive to shareholders.
The Seeka Group generated a record $23.5 million net profit
before tax, compared to $16.3 million in FY20. Net profit
before tax includes a $7.6 million settlement received from
the Psa kiwifruit claim class action taken by a number of
growers following the significant losses experienced by the
industry from the 2010 Psa outbreak.
Seeka’s growth has led to a new funding structure, and an
enlarged syndicated facility was negotiated in November.
Lead by Westpac New Zealand, this five-bank syndicated
facility secures funding for all near-term post harvest
capacity upgrades and supports Seeka’s growth strategy.
Post harvest capacity plans are constantly reviewed, and a
decision on a greenfield development at Pukenga has been
deferred in favour of upgrading KKP’s capacity by installing a
new packing machine and building high efficiency cool stores
at Transcool.
Fully staffing the business remains a constant challenge for
management as Covid-19 continues to disrupt the market
and availability of labour, including restricting the availability
of recognised seasonal employer workers (RSEs). Labour
availability currently looks better for harvest 2022.
All of Seeka's diverse business operations performed well in
FY21 with Seeka Australia, SeekaFresh and VLS all performing
ahead of expectation, noting the challenging local market
environment for SeekaFresh with Covid-19.
Seeka continues its progress on sustainability and in addition
to the sustainability information included in this report, we will
publish a full sustainability report for 2021 by 30 June. We are
working to build a sustainable business in a changing climate.

Seeka's strategy
Our strategy is to deliver operational excellence by working to
a disciplined and professional plan with robust contingency
measures. We understand the demand dynamics for each
fruit we handle, and are implementing innovative solutions
and automation to improve productivity. Seeka is investing
across the value chain.
SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

We are focussed on growth and making acquisitions that are
consistent with strategy and meet accretive thresholds, and
are working to lift financial performance and shareholder
returns as we build a bigger, more diverse produce company.
Seeka operates in a dynamic environment, we monitor new
developments and use commercial innovation to realise new
opportunities across our business.
We are fundamentally focussed on delivering an excellent
service to all growers and customers by operating a value
chain that delivers safe, sustainably-produced, high-quality
fruit. We strive to be a company where people want to work
and know they will be safe.

Strategic investments
The Seeka Group acquired two regional kiwifruit businesses
for $67.4 million in FY21 and secured a cornerstone investment
in the agritech start-up Fruitometry for $2.6 million.
In May, Seeka acquired OPAC for $60.6 million by issuing
$38.7 million of new Seeka shares and assuming $21.9 million
of debt. The OPAC acquisition secures 7.9 million kiwifruit
trays and new grower clients as it extends Seeka’s regional
presence eastward to Ōpōtiki, Te Kaha, East Coast and
Gisborne.
In November, Seeka acquired Orangewood for $6.8 million by
issuing $3.4 million of new Seeka shares, paying $1.3 million
in cash and assuming $2.1 million of debt. Now integrated,
Orangewood adds 2.2 million kiwifruit trays to Seeka’s
Northland operations along with contract avocado packing.
In July, Seeka invested $2.6 million for a 26% shareholding in
agritech start-up Fruitometry. Using smart orchard-scanning
technology, Fruitometry generates detailed maps to optimise
vine management on Seeka orchards, as well as refining
harvest and supply chain planning from orchard to market.
The current integration of orchard information into Seeka’s
systems will create a platform for efficiency gains.
In December, Seeka announced the acquisition of NZ Fruits
for $22.0 million by issuing $8.9 million new Seeka shares,
paying $8.9 million in cash and assuming $4.2 million of
debt. Completed February 2022, the NZ Fruits acquisition
consolidates Seeka’s presence in Gisborne, adds 2.2 million
kiwifruit trays and contract packing of citrus and persimmon.

Review of operations
Lifting earnings from Seeka's core business

Seeka's FY21 financial results are the result of a deliberate strategy to significantly improve Seeka’s
underlying operating earnings. Revenue is up 23% to $309.6 million (FY20 $251.5m) helped by a rebound
in Hayward volumes following a drought-impacted 2020, and the ongoing lift in SunGold production.
Net bank debt is up $22.8 million to $100.6 million (FY20
$77.9m) with the Group assuming $24.0 million of debt
and making $3.9 million in cash payments for the OPAC,
Orangewood and Fruitometry investments, as well as
absorbing acquisition and integration costs.

EBITDA is up 32% to $56.8 million (FY20 $42.9m) as a tight
focus on costs improved Seeka’s operating margin, especially
following the one-off Covid-19 expenses incurred FY20.
FY21 EBITDA also benefited from a $7.6 million
compensation payment from the Crown’s settlement of the
kiwifruit class action. This class action relates to the 2010
Psa incursion which impacted industry revenues, production
costs and asset values of many growers.

The two kiwifruit businesses are now fully integrated, and
along with the February 2022 acquisition of NZ Fruits are set
to significantly increase FY22 kiwifruit volumes and deliver
synergy gains across Seeka’s value chain.

Net profit before tax is up 44% to $23.5 million (FY20
$16.3m), with FY21 including $1.2 million of impairments for
the removal of the old KKP packline and Transcool coolstores
as the sites are prepared for 2022 capacity upgrades. It also
includes a $3.5 million lift in Group depreciation expense
largely associated with the acquired OPAC facility.

Dividend
Having lifted underlying profitability and generated strong
cash flows, the Board approved a final dividend of 13 cents for
FY21 (fully imputed), to be paid 23 February 2022. Combined
with the 13 cents per share interim dividend paid 13 October,
this brings the total dividends paid to shareholder relating to
the FY21 year to 26 cents per share (FY20 24c).

Net profit after tax is down 2% to $14.9 million (FY20
$15.2m), noting FY20 included a one-off $5.6 million
deferred tax benefit.

of Group revenue

$77.1m
Up 2% on
FY20 $75.7m

Orcharding generated $77.1 million in revenue; up 2% on FY20.
EBITDA was $5.2 million, compared to $5.4 million FY20 due to
lower market returns for kiwifruit, higher production costs and the
addition of OPAC overheads post acquisition.
Seeka (excluding OPAC) grew 14.4 million trays of kiwifruit; up 11% on FY20.
Hayward production rebounded to 8.7 million trays on improved yields and
SunGold increased to 5.4 million trays driven by increases in productive hectares
and yields.
Orcharding also produced 220,000 trays of Hayward and SunGold organic
kiwifruit, along with 1,394 tonnes of avocado for the 2020/21 season, (2019/20:
1,614 tonnes) and 140 tonnes of kiwiberry for harvest 2021 (2020: 172 tonnes).
Eastern and Northland operations increased with the OPAC and Orangewood
acquisitions and are set to deliver significant volume growth in FY22. Seeka also
continues to invest in new kiwifruit and avocado developments, partnering with
landowners, iwi and the Kānoa - Regional Economic Development & Investment
Unit (previously the Provincial Growth Fund) to collectively develop 156 hectares of
kiwifruit on managed and leased land.

Post harvest
Stewarding 42 million trays of fruit from New Zealand orchards to the markets 1

Post harvest generated $195.9 million in revenue; up 40% on FY20.
EBITDA was $61.6 million, compared to $41.9 million FY20, on
volume growth, an improved operating margin following the oneoff Covid-19 costs incurred FY20, and the contribution from VLS
laboratory maturity testing service to the national kiwifruit industry.
Seeka's eight facilities packed 37.2 million trays of kiwifruit; up 10% on FY20.
OPAC, acquired in May 2021, packed a further 3.5 million trays post acquisition.
Post harvest also packed 295,000 trays of avocado at the end of the 2020/21
season, and 683,000 trays from the start of the 2021/22 season, along with 3,928
tonnes of citrus and 91 tonnes of berries.
Post harvest financial performance includes OPAC revenue and expenses post
acquisition. This includes packing 3.5 million trays, cool chain management of
5.4 million trays, and operating overheads until year end. Now fully integrated,
OPAC, Orangewood, and NZ Fruits acquired February 2022, are set to significantly
increase FY22 volumes and release synergies from a significantly enlarged post
harvest operation. With these three acquisitions, we enter harvest 2022 with 11
post harvest facilities and an expectation to increase earnings.

SeekaFresh benefitted from an improved performance from our New Zealand
wholesale and retail service operations, including the import and ripening of
tropical fruits. This is despite the ongoing impact of lockdowns and other Covid-19
restrictions on New Zealand operations. Weak pricing from the Australian avocado
market for the 2021/22 season, however, significantly impacted SeekaFresh’s sales
commission.
Retailed by SeekaFresh and sold under the Seeka brand, the 2020/21 avocado
season benefited from a strong Australian market, with SeekaFresh able to sell a
high proportion direct to Australia's premium supermarket retailers. With a high
demand for summer avocado, SeekaFresh sold 33% of the 2020/21 crop in the
FY21 period. This generated good revenues from SeekaFresh's sales commission
and returned excellent value to Seeka's supplying growers.
The 2021/22 Australian avocado market, however, is weak and revenues down
with SeekaFresh selling more avocados into Asia and on the domestic market.
With the bulk of each season’s crop sold in the August to December period, this
impacted FY21 earnings from SeekaFresh’s sales commission.

Growing and selling Australian kiwifruit, nashi and pears

Australian operations generated $13.9 million in revenue; up 6% on
FY20. EBITDA was $1.6 million, compared to $7.4 million FY20.
FY20 benefited from a one-off $6.2 million gain on sale of the producing kiwifruit
orchards, which the Group now leases. If removed, FY20 operating EBITDA would
be $1.2 million, showing a 33% growth in Australian operating earnings in FY21.

Revenue
– Fruit sales

While impacted by Covid-19, local management produced an excellent result as
they dealt with labour shortages, ongoing market disruptions and lockdowns, and
delivered efficiency gains that outweighed the new orchard lease costs.
Seeka continues to invest in growing more produce in Australia with 63 hectares of
kiwifruit in development, 11 hectares of the red-blush Ricó pear and nine hectares of
new nashi varieties. We are also trialling new crops, including dates.

Automation, technology and capacity
Implementing new technology along Seeka's full value chain

Seeka continues to test and then invest in automation and new technologies that are reliable, provide
the opportunity to redeploy labour, and generate a return on capital. Innovations are being implemented
across our full value chain in New Zealand and Australia.
Seeka’s investment in Fruitometry provides direct access to smart-scanning
technology. By detailing fruit density and condition, the online Fruitometry maps
provide orchard owners with accurate information to optimise on-orchard work. It
also provides reliable information to Seeka’s post harvest team to plan supply chain
operations.
In post harvest, new automated tray-preparation, bag inserters and packing
machines for bulk boxes and single-layer trays have been implemented, along with
automated pallet strappers. A fully-automated packing and stacking option will be
trialled at Seeka’s NZ Fruits facility in 2023.
In Australia, Seeka has implemented new packing technologies, including a new
nashi machine to carefully grade and pack this delicate fruit. By removing hand
grading the new nashi machine has improved fruit quality and delivered efficiency
gains to our operations.

Fruitometry to watch kiwifruit
orchard scanning.

The Group continues to innovate its management systems, particularly labour
management on the orchard and in the packhouse. When our Australian
operations were impacted by on-going lockdowns and the Omicron outbreak, our
Australian business innovated, and these learnings are now being adopted across
our New Zealand business, including new touchless site entry and revised health
protocols.
Post harvest capacity is continuously reviewed, and the decision to build a
greenfield facility at Pukenga has been deferred until there is more certainty on
demand, pack configuration and shipping.
To meet near-term capacity demand, a $20 million build at KKP and Transcool
has been commissioned. KKP is being upgraded with a highly-automated MAF
Roda packline that will lift shed capacity and reduce the labour load. A new
650,000 tray static capacity cool store with environmentally-friendly coolant is
under construction at Transcool. These upgrades are expected to deliver sufficient
capacity through to 2024.

Labour and safe-and-healthy workspaces
Delivering a professional service and keeping our people safe
in a fast-paced environment

Labour is an ongoing challenge for all producers, service providers and exporters across New Zealand
and Australia. Severe shortages at peak periods were experienced in 2020 and 2021. Seeka was short of
skilled orcharding and packhouse workers in both countries. The company has invested in on-site gyms,
provided transport and meals, and paid competitive remuneration, including working and paying public
holidays in the season to attract staff.
Additionally, our teams are collaborating with iwi and
government agencies and run induction programmes at our
facilities to train job seekers and prepare them for work.
Local workers are complemented by New Zealand’s RSE
programme. In 2021, at a cost of $1.9 million we recruited
300 RSE workers from the Government’s 2000 RSE quota.
Including RSE workers that remained in the country since
the Covid-19 outbreak, Seeka’s total RSE workforce at
peak demand was 480. For 2022, Seeka has approval for
approximately 1200 RSEs.

Watch video
See Seeka's social media video
on working at Seeka.

While labour shortages exacerbated the safety risk profile,
our safety focus continues to lift and Seeka has become a
safer company in 2021. Seeka continues to invest to keep
people safe, including adding more guarding and barriers
that remove opportunities for mobile plant and humans to
collide, and rolled out a new HIT-NOT proximity detection
system that detects and protects people from moving
forklifts. These actions have helped eliminate serious harm
forklift incidents in 2021.
On-orchard movements are tracked via the one-step
Seeka app sign-in process, which provides direct access to
accurate orchard maps that clearly mark all hazards. In FY21,
Seeka invested $1 million replacing its orchard tractor fleet to
ensure our workers use modern, fit-for-purpose equipment.

Watch video
See the HIT-NOT proximity
detection system in operation.

Seeka developed an infectious diseases manual and
operated to strict hygiene protocols throughout 2020
and 2021. While parts of the business experienced high
levels of lockdown, the processes secured the safety of the
Seeka team, including our stakeholder community, and
ensured business continuity so the business could deliver an
essential service in New Zealand and Australia.

Outlook
Delivering performance to shareholders, employees
and supply chain partners

The Board and management have enacted Seeka's strategy in 2021,
with the Group completing key investments that are positioned to
further improve shareholder returns in 2022.
Seeka is pursuing an active growth strategy through acquisitions to build shareholder
value and lift returns on capital employed. By becoming bigger and more diverse, Seeka
is building a robust, sustainable business to deliver performance to shareholders,
employees and our supply chain partners.
Throughout this growth process, the Board keeps a careful watch on Seeka's balance
sheet to ensure we have headroom to prioritise operations, manage risk, and invest
in opportunities that drive shareholder returns. With broad support from the banking
community, we have secured an enlarged syndicated banking facility that supports
near-term growth.
Key to our operational success is Seeka's dedicated team of employees in New Zealand
and Australia. Seeka’s people have excelled under the pressure of Covid-19 and labour
shortages across New Zealand and Australia. They have adapted, innovated and
strived to deliver an excellent service and returns to our growers, and excellent fruit
quality to our customers.
We invest in the safety of our people, and set remuneration structures, training and
career pathways that attract and promote the best people within our industry. Our
people continue to make Seeka an inspiring company to work for and are celebrated
and thanked for their efforts.
We continue to review our post harvest capacity and are investing in new technology
to manage volume growth through to 2024. We recognise that innovation and
automation are key to improving productivity and making the best use of a tight
seasonal labour market. At Seeka, we achieve operational excellence by having a
professional team execute a disciplined plan using the best technology.
Our strategy extends beyond operational and financial performance to ensure we have
a sustainable business which includes how we support our communities, care for our
environment and govern the company. We are progressing our carbon footprint plan to
reduce Seeka's environmental impact.
We are excited by the progress we have made in FY21, which has grown our fruit
supply base by more than 25%, and look forward to tangible benefits being generated
for stakeholders in FY22.

SEEKA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
Sustainability focuses on meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Seeka’s
ambition is to measure and incrementally improve our environmental and social performance and the associated governance processes
and to demonstrate that we are meeting our corporate responsibilities as a sustainable company.
Environmental sustainability lies at the heart of Seeka’s brand attribute Growing Futures; Seeka is focused on continually improving
operations to deliver healthy produce, use less resources, care for the environment, and deliver better outcomes to stakeholders.
Social responsibility lies at the heart of Seeka's brand attribute Founded on Relationships; Seeka wants to be the employer and service
provider of choice and values its connections to the communities with whom it works. It cares for the welfare of its growers, clients,
employees, investors and the communities in which it operates.
The sustainability committee is tasked with providing strategic guidance and feedback to the Board and management on Seeka's
sustainability framework, establishment of targets, measurement, and performance monitoring. Comprised of three directors, Seeka’s
sustainability committee is a forum that works with management to assess the potential impacts and opportunities of a changing climate.

Governance
Seeka's strategic direction is based on the sustainable production and supply of healthy produce to consumers.
Governance is specifically covered as a section in this annual report, see page 77.

Environmental report
Seeka's aim is to be an industry leader, transparently reporting on our environmental impact and the opportunities and risks associated
with climate change.
Seeka's Agile Sustainability Team (SAST) is representative of all of Seeka’s businesses connecting people from across the company.
They work to integrate sustainability into every aspect of our business, including delivering projects intended to reduce Seeka’s
environmental footprint.
Climate change is an active risk, impacting the yield, quality and marketability of the produce Seeka grows and handles. By disclosing
climate-related risks, stakeholders can see how Seeka is flexing business activities and operations to mitigate environmental risks and
embrace new opportunities.
Seeka is committed to advancing regenerative horticulture practices. Seeka's research and development team are conducting
environmental trials to better understand the impact to our environment of inputs such as sprays, fertilisers and irrigation. These trials
build knowledge that leads to more sustainable on orchard practices that are shared with our growers.
Seeka has analysed all business operations to identify and understand the production inputs, how they flow through the business, and
the waste outputs that impact the environment. Seeka is working to transition to a circular model whereby waste is circulated back into
operations, thereby reducing its environmental impact.

Scenario analysis – understanding how a changing climate impacts fruit production
Scenario analysis is underway to gauge how higher temperatures, varying water availability and rising sea levels may impact New
Zealand orchard production. By understanding how a changing climate may impact crop yields and quality, Seeka can prepare its
operations to provide an efficient, sustainable service to Seeka's growers and a reliable product supply to consumers.
Carbon footprint – measuring and setting targets
Seeka is committed to understanding and lowering its carbon footprint to support Government targets under the Paris Agreement
intended to limit global temperature increases to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.
Seeka has established a baseline by calculating 2019 greenhouse gas emissions using ISO 14064-1: 2018 Greenhouse Gases and the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, see ghgprotocol.org, with the calculations independently verified by Toitu Envirocare. Toitu Envirocare has also
been engaged to verify Seeka's 2020 and 2021 years. Seeka will then set ‘point in time’ carbon-reduction targets.
The 2020 and 2021 results will be reported in Seeka's sustainability report once verified.

Sustainability projects 2021 and 2022
As we work to measure our emissions, Seeka has already embarked on a series of carbon-reduction initiatives.

Hybrid vehicle fleet

Waste audits

Seeka is exploring hybrid electric vehicles
(HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV)
and battery electric vehicles (BEV). Seeka
has introduced hybrid options and is actively
encouraging their selection to reduce the
number of conventional ICE fleet vehicles.

Seeka has developed a waste audit programme
to identify, measure and report the volume
and type of waste produced by our operating
business units. Waste reduction plans are
being developed at a business unit level. The
first waste audit was undertaken at head office
and a waste reduction plan is currently under
development.

2022 goal is to increase the proportion of
hybrid EV vehicles in Seeka's fleet

Worm farm
In full production, Seeka's continuous-flow
worm farm is expected to divert 50 tonnes of
packhouse organic waste from landfill. It will
produce quality vermicompost, delivering a
regenerative, fully circular approach to orchard
production.
2022 goal is to continue to increase throughput
and trial alternative waste streams

Solar energy
The solar panels at Seeka 360 head office
have generated 120 MWh of energy since
2018, which is approximately one third of the
building's energy demand. They also feed
batteries providing energy security in the event
of an outage. In 2021 Seeka installed a 238
kWh solar system at its Northland Kerikeri post
harvest facility.
2022 goal is to evaluate and install solar
systems on more of our post harvest facilities

LED lighting and sensors

LED

Seeka is rolling out more than one million kWh
of savings by converting existing lighting to LED
with sensors. It is estimated this will reduce
Seeka's carbon emissions by 167 tonnes,
equivalent to the emissions from 239 houses.
2022 goal is to continue the roll out of LED
lighting and sensors

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

2022 goal is to complete and monitor the head
office waste reduction plan and scope orchard
and post harvest operations

Regenerative horticulture
Seeka is researching practical ways to
incorporate regenerative horticulture practices.
This includes cover crops, new mowing and
spraying protocols that allow orchards to
naturally retain higher carbon and water levels.
2022 goal is to continue investigating
regenerative horticulture options and share
findings with our grower community

Refrigerants
With fugitive emissions from refrigeration units
identified as a significant contributor to Seeka's
emissions footprint, Seeka has aligned with the
government’s efforts to reduce ozone-depleting
gases by only installing new systems that run
on naturally-occurring refrigerant gases with no
global warming potential. Existing refrigerant
gasses are being assessed and will be phased
out.

Packaging and waste
Seeka is committed to moving the fresh
produce industry towards a circular economy
using low-impact packaging innovation, and is
working with packaging experts to introduce
new technology and materials to its logistics
processes.

Basis of preparation
Accounting policies that apply to Seeka's full set of financial statements

This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements. Accounting policies
which are limited to a specific note are described in that note.

Reporting entity and statutory base

Basis of consolidation

The financial statements presented are those of the consolidated
Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as Seeka Limited or the
Company. The group is referred to as the Group, Seeka, or Seeka
Group.

Subsidiaries

Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New
Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets
Conduct (FMC) Reporting Entity for the purposes of the FMC Act
2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the
NZX main board equity security market (NZX Main Board).

Nature of operations
Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
In New Zealand the Group provides orchard management, orchard
leasing, post harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit,
avocado, citrus, berry and kiwiberry industries. Seeka manufactures
and sells the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product range along with
avocado oil. The Group also provides retail and ripening services for
imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale market.
In Australia, Seeka owns, leases and operates orchards and associated
post harvest assets, making the Group the largest producer and
supplier of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of
European pears, plus lesser production of other temperate-climate
fruits, including plums.

Summary of significant accounting policies
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the
periods presented in the financial statements.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The financial statements for the Group have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the FMC Act 2013.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),
incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other applicable financial
reporting standards as appropriate for profit-oriented entities. The
Group financial statements also comply with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with
the exception of:
– assets classified as held for sale at fair value (note 9)
– land and buildings at fair value (note 10)

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intragroup balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting
from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets exchanged, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date the acquisition is
settled. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on
transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency (NZD) using the exchange rates prevailing during the month
of that transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income
statement. The presentational currency is the New Zealand dollar
(NZD).
Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of
which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
– Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the
Group are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance
sheet;
– Income and expenses for each entity's income statement and
statement of other comprehensive income, are translated at
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
– All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other
comprehensive income.

– water shares at fair value (note 11)
– biological assets - crop at fair value (note 12)
– right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities at present value of
expected cash payments (note 13)
– financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at
fair value through comprehensive income (note 30 and note 31)
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
financial statements are set out below.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the
Board) on 18 February 2022.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Current economic environment

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future
operational and financial performance. By definition, these
assumptions may not always equal actual results. The estimates
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are
identified in the notes below. Estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as
adjusted for current market conditions and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Assumptions underlying management’s estimates
can be found in the following notes to the financial statements.

The economic environment has been impacted by the arrival of
Covid-19 in March 2020, and it continues to have an impact through
2021 and into 2022.
During the 2021 financial year Covid-19 presented a number
of challenges, including varying levels of national and localised
Government lockdowns in both New Zealand and Australia.
Throughout all of these challenges, Seeka continued to operate as
an essential business for fruit production, processing and wholesale
market operations.

While the impact on revenue was minimised, the increased health and
safety measures that were rolled out, including protective screens,
face masks, and other personal protective equipment, are an ongoing,
significant operating expense and contribute to reduced operating
efficiency during periods of lockdown.

Going concern assumption
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Goods and services tax (GST)
The statement of financial performance and statement of
comprehensive income have been prepared so that all components are
stated exclusive of GST. All items in the statement of financial position
are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables,
which include GST invoiced.

Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the
entity
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have
been issued and are effective that are expected to have a significant
impact on the Group.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

Post harvest and orchard revenue was minimally impacted by the
effect of Covid-19.
Revenue in the retail services operations segment, which includes
Seeka’s wholesale market operations in Auckland, was impacted due
to reduced wholesale market demand from independent fresh produce
retailers who were closed during the extended level four and level
three Covid-19 lockdowns in Auckland. Demand for the Group's Kiwi
Crush, Crushies ice blocks and avocado oil which are sold in retail
stores and to schools was also down during the Covid-19 lockdown
periods. The reduction in revenue flowed through to reduced profit
levels for the retail services operations segment.
The Australian operational result improved as fruit returns remained
strong for the 2021 year.
Statement of financial position
The statement of financial position is healthy and Seeka operated
profitably throughout the year. The Group increased its bank facilities
through a new syndicated loan facility lead by Westpac New Zealand
Limited.
The upcoming 2022 harvest volumes are looking positive and the
future projections for Seeka remain strong subject to a major Covid-19
outbreak during the kiwifruit harvest period of March to June. While
labour availability will be an issue for the coming harvest, (see note
28), Seeka has a number of mechanisms in place to recruit local
workers and has secured some employees under the Recognised
Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in business
activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a
manner consistent with the internal reports provided to the chief
decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the
allocation of resources alongside operational outcomes, such as
EBITDA and EBIT, and are responsible for setting strategic direction.
The Group has five operating segments:
– Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary
services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the
retail sector.
– A single Australian segment encompasses the integrated business
associated with the Group’s Australian-grown produce.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each
segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs and
other income from the sale of assets recorded in the statement of
financial performance are allocated to all other segments. Transactions
between segments are conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated
on consolidation.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations
The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.

Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and
internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This
includes fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post
harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported fruit, and operates a wholesale market.
Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi
Crush, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and hospitals,
along with post harvest services for kiwiberry.
All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower
services and overhead sections recorded in the statement of financial
performance and impairment and revaluations of other assets not
attributed directly to any other segment. It also includes other nonoperating income, including the gain on sale from assets that had been
classified as held for sale, and the settlement of the Psa claim with the
Crown.

Australian operations
The Group grows, provides post harvest services, and retails all
produce from orchards the Group owns or leases in Australia. The
main products are kiwifruit, nashi pears and European pears, which are
primarily sold in Australia. Included in the 2020 result is a one-off gain
from the settlement of the sale and leaseback transaction, see note 9.

The Group also produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
orchard owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
citrus, berry, and kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the
Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from
independent orchard owners.

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors and
management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expense associated with
debt (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large investments in fixed and leased
assets (EBITDA).

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

Main contents
Financial contents

Accounting policies
The Group’s major revenue streams are post harvest operations,
orchard management, retail services and Australian operations in
accordance with NZ IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers (NZ
IFRS 15).
Post harvest
The Group enters into two standardised post harvest contracts:
– The first has two performance obligations; to collect the supply
of fruit via picking and transportation, and maturity testing. The
charges are separated in the contract. All revenue is recognised
when the service is performed.
– The second has three performance obligations; to pack fruit, to cool
and dispatch fruit, and to sell class 2 fruit to authorised markets.
These are stand-alone services provided by the Group. Each
performance obligation has a separate transaction price detailed in
the contract and the obligations are recognised when services are
performed; packing revenue as fruit is packed, cooling revenue as
fruit is loaded out from cool storage, and class 2 as fruit is sold and
delivered.
Orchard management
The Group enters into two orchard management contracts that are
largely standardised:
– The first has one performance obligation; to manage fruit growing.
Revenue is recognised as the service is performed and calculated
at cost plus a margin per the contract or at a fixed per-hectare
charge. The management fee included in the contract is recognised
evenly over the contract's 12 month period. An incentive fee is only
recognised when agreed orchard gate return (OGR) targets are
achieved and an incentive would be receivable.
– The second has one performance obligation; to collect the supply
of fruit on short term and long term managed orchards. The
transaction price is determined using a forecasted OGR. Revenue
is recognised when crops are picked (in the June half year accounts
for kiwifruit).
Retail services
The Group enters into three retail service contracts which are
customised to the service being offered (such as ripening or fruit sales):
– The first has one performance obligation; to sell fruit on the owner’s
behalf. As the sales agent, the Group only collects a marketer’s
commission which is recognised when the fruit is sold and delivered.
– The second has one performance obligation; to either store or ripen
fruit. Revenue is recognised as the fruit is stored or ripened.
– The third has one performance obligation; to provide ordered
product. The transaction price is based on the agreed price (either
in writing or verbally) with revenue recognised when the fruit is sold
and delivered.
Australia
The Group has two types of contracts that are entered by the Australian
business; one is for the long-term leasing of kiwifruit orchards, and the
other is for the sale and supply of fruit.
– The orchard leasing contract is an obligation to make lease
payments as the Group manages leased orchards.
– The fruit sale and supply contacts are entered on a one-to-one basis
with the fruit purchaser and are largely standardised. They have one
performance obligation; to provide the fruit to the customer. The
transaction price is based on the agreed price (either in writing or
verbally) and recognised when the fruit is sold and delivered.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

Contracts from acquired businesses
All revenue contracts acquired as part of the Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool
Storage Limited (OPAC) and Orangewood Limited (Orangewood)
acquisitions, (see note 19) are substantially similar in nature to Seeka’s
current revenue contracts, with the exception of the timing of the cool
storage revenue recognition related to OPAC, which is accounted for
as fruit is packed rather than loaded out. From the end of 2021, the
Group's standard service contracts will apply.
Principal versus agent relationship
A principal relationship is one where the Group has the performance
obligation to provide the good or service directly and has control of the
asset or has a right to direct the asset. An agency relationship is one
where the performance obligation is to arrange for the good or service
on behalf of the supplier. The Group currently has agent relationships
for the sale of some fruit and vegetables in the retail services segment.
Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations,
with post harvest revenues recognised as services are provided and
orcharding revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail
revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New Zealand kiwifruit
are harvested from March to June, avocados from July to February, and
kiwiberry from February to March. In Australia nashi and European
pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit from March to
May. As a result of these harvest timings around 60~70% of orchard
revenues are recognised in the first six months of the financial year.
Due to seasonal fluctuations, the timing of the provision of post
harvest services can vary from year to year, however normally 70~80%
is recognised in the first six months of the financial year, but can be
impacted by seasonal fluctuations.
Irrigation water rights
Water allocation rights are carried at fair value supported by the
value of the traded rights on a recognised exchange or market at
measurement date. Annual water allocation rights are recognised as
a current asset when they are allocated to the Group's permanent
water shares from the first of July each year by the Victorian Water
Register, and are subsequently expensed when the entitlement is
used to irrigate orchards. Any gain on revaluation is recognised in the
statement of financial performance.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the
effective interest method.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.
Gain on sale of assets classified as held for sale
The gain on sale of assets classified as held for sale is recognised when
a sale and purchase agreement is unconditional and the consideration
is paid or payable at that date.
Proceeds from settlement of kiwifruit Psa claim
The income relating to the proceeds from the settlement of the
kiwifruit Psa claim from the Crown is recognised when the claim is
settled and the amount is confirmed as received or receivable.

During the year the Group recognised $0.15m of costs relating to the measurement of the employee share schemes issued based on the Black
Scholes Model (Dec 2020 - $0.15m).

Accounting policies
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of financial performance as incurred, except where future economic benefits arise and they
are recorded as a prepayment.
Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are
recognised in other payables. The employee liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating
sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

Main contents
Financial contents

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date,
and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability
in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit. Differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following table details the offset amounts.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2020 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.
Legislation enacted 25 March 2020 reinstated tax depreciation deductions on non-residential buildings. This resulted in a one-off $5.6m gain in
the income tax calculation for the 2020 financial year, see note 6.

8. Events occurring after balance date
On 10 December 2021, the Group announced the conditional acquisition of New Zealand Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits) by way of amalgamation with
Seeka East Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, for an enterprise value assessed at $21.90m. As at 31 December 2021 balance date
the amalgamation was subject to a number of conditions including NZ Fruits shareholder approval, which was then subsequently obtained post
year end on 19 January 2022. The settlement and amalgamation was completed after balance date, on 2 February 2022 with the issue of 1,687,860
Seeka shares and a cash payment of $8.85m to NZ Fruits shareholders. As at this reporting date a detailed assessment of the fair value of acquired
net assets has not been performed due to limited time available between settlement date and the preparation of the financial statements.
On 20 January 2022, the Group declared a full year dividend of $0.13 per share in relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2021. The
dividend will be fully imputed, and the dividend reinvestment plan will apply. The dividend record date is 28 January 2022 and the dividend will be
paid on 23 February 2022.
On 2 February 2022 Seeka completed the acquisition of New Zealand Fruits Limited by way of amalgamation which included consideration of new
Seeka shares to be issued ex-dividend and cash. The full year dividend is normally paid in April each year, however this year the payment date for
the full year dividend has been varied to ensure the new shares relating to NZ Fruits are issued ex-dividend on their issue date.
There are no other material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statements.

Asset class

Total assets classified as held for sale

Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and
the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within one year from the date of classification. The accounting standards allow
for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control. In limited cases it has taken more than
12 months to find a willing buyer, however Seeka remains committed to selling the properties and with the current interest in the properties sales
contracts are anticipated within the next 12 months. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
At 31 December 2021, 13 hectares of orchards (Dec 2020 - 23 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. These properties were
part of the 2018 purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited.
Sale and leaseback transaction in Seeka Australia
Assets related to three kiwifruit orchards in Australia (Hayward, Austral and Lakes) were recognised as held for sale at 31 December 2019. On 15
December 2020, the Group sold the three orchards for AU$26.50m and leased them back for an initial term of 10.5 years, with rights of renewal out
to 25 years. The terms of the sale and leaseback are typical of those entered into for an orchard.
The definition of a sale under NZ IFRS 15 was met and the transaction was carried out at fair value. Sales proceeds received were judged to reflect
the fair value of the underlying assets. The quarterly rental was deemed to be a fair market rent.
The transaction was accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 98 to 103 of NZ IFRS 16 and the Group estimated the present value of the rental
obligations in respect of the leaseback to be AUD$14.08m (NZD$15.01m), based on the initial term of the leaseback of 10.5 years, discounted at an
incremental borrowing rate of 6.79% per annum, with the transaction giving rise to the following:
– Right of use asset of AUD$7.47m (NZD$7.97m)
– Net proceeds from sale and leaseback of AUD$26.50m (NZD$28.24m)
– Lease liability assumed of AUD$14.08m (NZD$15.01m)
– Net gain on sale and leaseback of AUD$5.83m (NZD$6.18m)
All goodwill from the Australia cash generating unit was allocated in 2019 to the disposal group, based on the Group's assessment of relative fair
values of the assets held for sale and Australia assets being retained.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group used estimates to judgementally recognise the remaining Northland orchards as held for sale, despite being classified as held for sale for
greater than 12 months. For the year ended 31 December 2020 the Group used judgement to classify the Australian sale and leaseback as an asset held
for sale and estimates to calculate and judgementally recognise the gain on sale. This included judging the right-of-use lease asset, lease liability, lease
term and estimated discount rate.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and
are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred
to the appropriate asset class. At 31 December 2021 the assets
under construction relate to the extension of the packhouse, and the
purchase and installation of a MAF Roda Grader at KKP, stage two of
the Transcool coolstore construction, and further investment relating
to automation in multiple packhouses.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a
three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for
buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung
Valuers, ANZIV, independent registered valuer.
In Australia valuations are undertaken by Preston Rowe Paterson
Shepparton (previously known as Goulburn Valley Property Services),
independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. All Australian
land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2019.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

The valuers consider up to four different approaches in concert to
arrive at a fair value;
1. Direct replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the
replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements based on
the current cost of construction less depreciation based on the age
of the building with an allowance for physical depreciation. Specific
consideration is given to the 'optimised depreciated replacement
cost' methodology.
2. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.
3. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the
property with a current market rental being established and
capitalising this at an appropriate rate of return (2021 valuations:
6.50% – 8.75%) that would be expected by a prudent investor. The
2021 year saw capitalisation rates decrease between 1.75% - 2.25%
since the previous valuations of the same properties.

41

Main contents
Financial contents

4. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the investment method
and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market rentals and estimated costs incurred
to maintain land and buildings in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are sold in the terminal year (year 11).
The net book value of land is $36.87m (Dec 2020 - $23.43m) and buildings is $191.65m (Dec 2020 - $147.14m), see note 29.
The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax, of $11.54m (Dec 2020 $10.43m).

Impairment of bearer plants
For the year ended 31 December 2020, $0.03m of cherries were at the end of their useful life and removed with the remaining costs impaired.
There was no significant impairment relating to bearer plants in the year ended 31 December 2021.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group impaired the following fixed assets:
– Coolstore facilities at Transcool in preparation for the construction of a new five-high, semi-automated, coolstore facility
– An existing canopy at KKP packhouse in preparation for the construction of the packhouse extension
– Decommissioning of the existing 10 lane grader at KKP to be replaced by a new MAF Roda grader
There was no significant impairment relating to property, plant and equipment in the year ended 31 December 2020.

Accounting policies
Bearer plants
Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear,
avocado and other fruiting vines and trees on Group-owned and leased
land. Bearer plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase or establish the
asset.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at
least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any subsequent
improvements at cost, less depreciation. At each annual balance date,
no less than one third of assets classified as land and buildings are
revalued and those valuations are used to assess the appropriateness
of the carrying values of all land and building assets held by the Group,
which effectively revalue all land and buildings annually. Revaluations
are performed more frequently if changing industry conditions may
cause their carrying value to differ significantly from fair value. Any
accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is
restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and
buildings are accounted for through comprehensive income and other
reserves, except where an asset's assessed fair value is less than the
original cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of
financial performance.
Property, plant and equipment
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical
cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to
purchase the asset.

42

Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other
repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of financial
performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Asset impairments are recognised in the statement of financial
performance.
Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
– Buildings
20 - 50 years
– Machinery
10 - 20 years
– Vehicles
4 - 7 years
– Furniture, fittings and equipment
– Bearer plants:

3 - 10 years
5 - 50 years

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted
if appropriate, at balance date and an asset’s carrying amount is
immediately written down to its recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is included in the
statement of financial performance. When revalued assets are sold, the
amounts included in the revaluation reserve in respect of those assets
are transferred to retained earnings.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 31 December 2021, 44% of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was revalued in line with policy. The change in property values in the
current year is consistent with the valuations completed in the year ended 31 December 2020 and results in 91% of Seeka's New Zealand property
portfolio being revalued over a two year period. Seeka operates in the food production industry, which remained stable with a high demand for healthy
foods during the Covid-19 pandemic. Properties situated in the Bay of Plenty are also expected to be less affected than other regions given the ongoing
strength of horticulture and agriculture businesses.
Seeka’s Australian properties are in the food production region of Victoria. The sale and leaseback transaction completed on 15 December 2020
supports the carrying values of the remaining properties.
Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause an increase in land and buildings of a further 3-5%.
This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

Impairment tests for goodwill
The Board reviews business performance based on operating segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level. Goodwill
represents the 2021 acquisitions of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited and Orangewood Limited, the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete
Coolstores Limited, the 2018 acquisition of the Northland business, the previously-acquired Glassfields business (now named SeekaFresh) and
the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value in use), with a terminal value
beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated in this note.
The assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit, is determined based on past
performance and the Board's expectations of future market dynamics, plus the Group's five year financial plans. The Group's market capitalisation
compared to net assets is also considered as part of the impairment review.
All amounts recognised as goodwill at 31 December 2021 were tested for impairment at balance date and no impairment arose in the current year.
Additions to goodwill
$8.25m of goodwill was recognised during the year; $7.63m from the OPAC acquisition, and $0.62m from the Orangewood acquisition. No
goodwill was recognised for the year ended 31 December 2020, see note 19.
Cash generating units (CGUs)
During the year ended 31 December 2021, the scope of the post harvest CGUs were reviewed. Previously the CGUs were defined as each packhouse
but following the review it was determined that with a number of recent acquisitions and growth in the business it was more appropriate that the post
harvest CGUs represented the group of packhouses in a region that operated as a collective group, with fruit allocated to sites within the region.
This reflects the operational coordination of packhouses in each region to maximise efficiency and flexibility by packing fruit at the optimum maturity
by allocating it to the next available facility. Fruit in Northland is not generally directed to the Bay of Plenty region, so this segment remains on its own
for consideration of goodwill. It was determined that there are two regional CGUs for the post harvest operations, being Northland and Bay of Plenty
(including Coromandel).
The goodwill that had been previously allocated to the Northland business is now part of the Northland postharvest CGU, along with the recent
Orangewood acquisition. The Aongatete Coolstores Limited goodwill is now part of the Bay of Plenty post harvest CGU which now includes the
goodwill recognised for the OPAC acquisition in 2021.

The following table details how water shares would be stated on the historical cost basis.

1. The discount rate is calculated based on the specific circumstances of the cash generating unit and its operations, and is derived from its
weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate for Seeka's Bay of Plenty CGU is set at 8% as this represents the Board's assessment of the
Group's weighted average cost of capital with an additional 1% added to recognise the higher risk of a smaller division.
2. The long term growth rate is based on growth in GDP, market conditions and opportunities for growth within the industry. The Group has set its
terminal growth rates between 1% - 2% to ensure a long term conservative growth estimate has been applied in the impairment tests.
3. If the EBITDA growth rates reduced to 2%, there is no impairment.
4. The EBITDA growth rates used for the Northland packhouse reflect the expected increase in SunGold kiwifruit volumes as plantings come into
production during the period being assessed, with 18% revenue growth expected in the second year, falling to 3% by year five. If the revenue
growth rates reduced to 2% in years 2 to 5, there would be no impairment.
5. The EBITDA growth used for the SeekaFresh business reflects the expected performance of the business over the period being assessed. A 10%
revenue growth rate is expected in the first year as the business recovers from Covid-19 lockdowns in Auckland.
6. The EBITDA and terminal growth rates used for Kiwi Crush reflects expected performance over the next 5 years as the business continues to
commercialise new product lines and explore new markets.
7. EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations.

ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Financial contents

At 31 December 2021, all goodwill balances were reviewed for indicators of impairment.
The goodwill relating to the Bay of Plenty Post Harvest and Northland Post Harvest cash generating units are supported by 2021 operational
outcomes. 2021 kiwifruit harvest volumes increased on the prior year and packing volumes are expected to increase further in future years. Whilst
Covid-19 impacted 2021 costs and labour supply, the post harvest segment operated profitably throughout the year, and throughout national
and localised lockdowns. For these reasons, there are no indications of impairment of the goodwill relating to the Bay of Plenty Post Harvest or
Northland Post Harvest cash generating units.
The goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush business is supported by current trading performance. There are no indications of impairment of the
goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush business.
SeekaFresh started the year well, until sales were impacted by Covid-19. The business continued to operate as an essential service, but was
affected by the temporary closure of hospitality and independent retail based customers during the lockdown. Following completion of the
restructuring period for SeekaFresh in 2020, the commission business (which includes the domestic and export sales of Seeka-grown avocado,
kiwiberry, and class two, class three, and collaboratively marketed kiwifruit), is integrated with the original Glassfields business to a degree where
it is indistinguishable from the original cash generating unit, and has therefore been included in the forecasted EBITDA assumptions. The terminal
growth rate has remained consistent, but sensitivity was performed to ensure a 1% terminal growth rate would not result in an impairment.
No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an impairment of goodwill.

Accounting policies
Intangible assets
Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested at least annually for impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the
recoverable amount. When assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able to generate cash flow.
Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. Internally
developed computer software is capitalised when it enters the development phase and includes costs incurred to develop and test the software
for use. Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life (typically three to five years).
Costs relating to software deemed to be classified as software as a service (S.A.A.S.) have been expensed during the year and included in the
statement of financial performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill on a business acquisition is included in intangible assets, and on acquisition of an associate is included in investments in
associates. When acquired in business combinations, the goodwill is annually tested for impairment (or more frequently if deemed prudent)
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to that business.
Water shares
The Group records permanent water shares at fair value based on the market price at balance date. The shares are fully tradeable and have an
indefinite life and are not amortised.
Other intangibles
Other intangibles subject to amortisation are amortised over the life of the asset on a straight line basis. The expense is charged to the statement
of financial performance.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The intangible assets impairment tests require judgement to determine the appropriate forecast cash flows and inputs into the calculations. The primary
estimates relate to the forecast EBITDA growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates.

Crop where cost is deemed fair value
Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date and as
such cost is deemed fair value, see note 29.
During the year $1.4m of biological assets within the 1 January 2021 opening balance relating to the Groups long-term orchard developments were
reclassified as bearer plants assets under construction (Dec 2020 - nil)

Accounting policies
Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair value depends
on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (provided the costs are
considered recoverable). When costs are not considered recoverable they are expensed in the statement of financial performance.
When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.
The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference to current and expected sales returns when available. When market data is
not available an assessment is made based on historical data.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The valuation of biological assets uses estimates of market returns to determine value.

Additions
On 15 December 2020, the Group completed a sale and leaseback transaction for three kiwifruit orchards totalling 199 hectares in Australia. The
completion of this sale created a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability, with the difference between the two recognised as a gain on sale
through the statement of financial performance.
On 4 May 2021, the Group acquired OPAC, which included $0.55m of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities, see note 19.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

Main contents
Financial contents

Accounting policies
Lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, including any renewal periods that are likely to be exercised,
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate which ranges between 3% and 11%. The discount rate is based on the Group's
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate the Group would borrow the funds required to purchase the asset. When determining the discount rate,
Seeka considers that the value of the right-of-use lease asset should not be greater than the fair value of the underlying asset being leased.
The Group’s right-of-use lease asset is equal to the lease liability on the day of lease inception, with the exception of sale and leaseback
transactions where the asset is measured as the proportion of the carrying value of the asset sold of which the benefit is retained by the Group.
The right-of-use lease asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Costs incurred with a lease that are not part of the
cost of the right-of-use lease asset are expensed.
All leases have been classified into one of the following asset classes:
– Land and building - leases for rental of all properties, including packhouses and coolstores
– Orchard - leases held for the development of productive orchards
– Equipment - leases for equipment, including plant equipment and forklifts
– Motor vehicles - three year leases for motor vehicles
The Group leases various properties for the packing and cooling of kiwifruit, leases orchards to grow kiwifruit and avocados, and leases equipment
and vehicles. The terms of the leases vary, with land and building leases ranging from 10 - 15 years, with one 99 year lease. Orchard leases range
from 3 - 25 years, and equipment and vehicle leases range from 1 - 3 years.
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. In the case of orchard leases, only the fixed rental is recognised as a lease liability.
Any variable consideration relating to profit share on the orchard leases is not accounted for as the profit share is only determined after a crop has
been harvested and is not identifiable at the commencement of the lease. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide
range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interest in the leased assets
that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
The Group is exposed to potential future increases in land and building lease payments based on contractual market rent reviews that are not
included in the lease liability until the rent review takes place.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and lease interest. The lease interest is charged to the statement of financial performance over
the term of the lease.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The valuation of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities uses judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rate and the likelihood of
exercising any rights of renewal to extend the lease term.

Accrued income and other sundry receivables includes income to be received from orcharding operations over leased and owned orchards
relating to 399 hectares (Dec 2020 - 484 hectares).
$2.26m of accrued income relates to funds still be received in relation to the settlement of the Psa claim.
Within current trade receivables, $2.49m are past due (Dec 2020 - $1.97m), of which 1.81% are more than 90 days (Dec 2020 - 1.6%). Noncurrent trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up
to five years.
A $0.25m provision for doubtful debts is recognised in the accounts (Dec 2020 - $0.16m).

Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group reviewed trade and other receivables for any debtor impairment, credit risk, or any other such risks that may result in non-payment.
The Group did not identify any circumstances that required further provisioning or impairment of financial instruments.

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the freehold
land and buildings, and a General Security Agreement over all the assets
of the following trading entities within the Group, as either borrowers or
guarantors. These entities make up the bank Charging Group.
The value of the Group’s assets that are not part of the Charging
Group is $11.83m, being less than 2.45% of the total Group assets.
The Charging Group comprises the following entities:
Borrowers and guarantors:
– Seeka Limited
– Seeka Australia (Pty) Limited

Guarantors:
– Aongatete Coolstores Limited
– Kiwi Coast Growers (Te Puke) Limited
– Northland Horticulture Limited
– OPAC Properties Limited
– Seeka East Limited
– Seeka OPAC Limited
– Seeka Te Puke Limited
The Group’s policy is to protect the term portion of the loans from
exposure to changing interest rates via the use of derivatives, see note 30.

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction
cost. When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the
period of the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
after balance date.

Grower loyalty share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit,
avocado and kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share
scheme, whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares
based on their orchard's current or forecast production. This issue of up
to 2.6m shares was approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
In April 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on
behalf of 405 participating growers. The issue price of $4.76 per share
was funded by the Group making a $9.8m non-interest-bearing loan
to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying
all product from the participating orchards for three consecutive
seasons the shares vest and participating growers can elect to pay the
outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend payments made
on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.

During 2021, 1,917,165 shares issued to kiwifruit growers vested, leaving
144,638 shares issued to avocado growers due to vest in 2022, see note 21.
Employee share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible employees to participate
in a five-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would
be allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business. In
April 2019, 568,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on
behalf of 319 participating employees. The issue price of $4.76 per share
was funded by the Group making a $2.7m non-interest-bearing loan
to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing
employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can
elect to pay the outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend
payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.
Shares issued under this scheme vest in 2022, see note 21.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

19. Business combination
Acquisition through amalgamation of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited (OPAC)
During the year the Group acquired OPAC, a kiwifruit post harvest and orcharding business based in Ōpōtiki, the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, into a
newly-formed 100% owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Seeka OPAC Limited. OPAC shares were cancelled with each share being exchanged
for 1.4833 shares in Seeka Limited, based on a price of $4.82 per Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing
on 24 March 2021, with all fractions of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole number). The purchase was settled 4 May 2021 for a recorded
consideration of $38.73m when Seeka issued 7,042,574 ordinary shares at $5.50, being the share market price on the acquisition date as per NZ
IFRS 3. The change in share price between the VWAP and the share price on acquisition date had the impact of increasing goodwill by $4.80m.
On acquisition, the Group drew down a $27m loan to repay the acquired interest bearing liabilities of $21.86m, with the remainder used to service
OPAC's working capital requirements for the remainder of the season.
OPAC contributed $29.46m of revenue and $1.07m of net profit before tax to the Group for the period from 4 May to 31 December 2021. If the
acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021, OPAC would have contributed $36.06m of revenue and $2.87m of net profit before tax for the 12
months ended 31 December 2021. These calculations are not significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies between the Group
and the acquired subsidiary, and no significant additional depreciation would have been charged if fair value adjustments to property, plant and
equipment had applied from 1 January 2021, including consequential tax effects.

OPAC fair value of assets and liabilities, goodwill and acquisition-related costs
The fair value of acquired trade receivables, within trade and other receivables, is $0.40m. There was no loss allowance recognised on acquisition.
The goodwill of $7.63m is allocated to the Bay of Plenty post harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of the amalgamation was to
obtain the post harvest facility and associated grower relationships. The goodwill is attributable to the operation’s strong market position in the
Ōpōtiki, East Cape and Gisborne regions, and synergies expected to arise from adding an extra post harvest facility to the Seeka Group. The
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs of $0.47m are included in administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $1.61m was provided in relation to differences between
tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets. Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the disclosed fair values of
assets and liabilities. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the acquisition date.
Seeka has identified and updated the fair values of assets and liabilities for the crystallisation of expense provisions made in the initial fair values as
disclosed in June 2021 and the tax implications arising as a result. The net impact was a reduction of initially disclosed goodwill by $2.11m.

Acquisition through amalgamation of Orangewood Limited (Orangewood)
During the year the Group amalgamated Orangewood, an integrated kiwifruit and avocado post harvest and orchard management business based
in Kerikeri, Far North District, New Zealand, into a newly formed 100% owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Northland Horticulture Limited.
Orangewood shares were cancelled with each share being exchanged for 0.663 shares in Seeka and $1.35 cash. Seeka shares were issued based
on a price of $5.33 per Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 13 September 2021, with all fractions
of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole number).
The purchase was settled on 22 November 2021 for a purchase consideration of $4.66m by the issue of 639,302 ordinary shares in Seeka Limited
at a market price of $5.25 on the settlement date of 22 November 2021, being the market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3, and a
cash consideration of $1.30m. The change in the share price on acquisition date had the impact of decreasing goodwill by $0.05m.
Orangewood has contributed $0.33m of revenue and $0.21m of net loss before tax to the Group for the period 22 November to 31 December
2021. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021, Orangewood would have contributed $17.99m of revenue and $0.16m of net profit before
tax for the 12 months ended 31 December 2021. These calculations are not significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies between
the Group and the acquired subsidiary, and no significant additional depreciation would have been charged if fair value adjustments to property,
plant and equipment had applied from 1 January 2021, including consequential tax effects.
The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

The fair value of acquired current trade receivables, within trade and other receivables, is $1.55m. There is no loss allowance recognised on
acquisition. The goodwill of $0.62m is allocated to the Northland post harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of the amalgamation
was to obtain the packhouse facility and increase the Group's presence in the desirable Far North District. The goodwill is attributable to the
operation’s market position in the region and synergies expected to arise after adding the business into the corporate structure of the larger Seeka
Group. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired in the foreseeable future and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs of $0.37m are included in overhead expenses. Deferred tax of $0.25m has been provided in relation to differences
between tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets.
Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the fair values of the assets and liabilities disclosed above if more information comes
to light that suggests the values differ. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the
acquisition date.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The fair values of assets are subject to estimates and judgement. Seeka engaged Telfer Young to complete an independent valuation of the land and
buildings at the acquisition dates. The remaining property, plant and equipment was assessed on a depreciated historical cost basis, as well as a
physical stocktake and a comparison to similar Seeka-owned assets. The Group assessed that any intangible asset that exists for grower relationships
and contracts would be immaterial for financial reporting using the multi-period excess earnings method of calculating intangible assets on contracts.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued and outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

The land and buildings revaluation reserve records increments and decrements on the revaluation of land and buildings.
The foreign currency translation reserve records foreign currency translation differences of Group entity results and financial position. The amounts

The foreign currency revaluation reserve records unrealised gains and losses on Group assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies.
The share reserve records the value of option benefits recognised on the Group's grower loyalty and employee share schemes as detailed in this note.
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
– An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
– An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust
deed established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the sale of shares are used
to repay the debt owed to the Company.

At balance date the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted to employees and remain outstanding under the scheme was
593,998 (Dec 2020 - 689,008), representing 1.48% (Dec 2020 - 2.14%) of the shares of the Company on issue at that date.
Grower loyalty share scheme
Under the grower loyalty share schemes, shares are issued to a share trust in return for a debt owned back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvest seasons, with the final harvest season
being the avocado harvest season ending 31 March 2022. The option benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period.
At the end of the vesting period the grower has an option to either settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred
to them, or to not have the shares transferred to them, whereby any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The
proceeds from the shares that vest or from the sale of shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.
In September 2021, the three-season supply commitment period for kiwifruit and kiwiberry growers ended, and 1,917,165 shares vested. 144,638
shares issued to avocado growers remain in the scheme and vest at the completion of the 2021/22 avocado harvest.

For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust on behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.
The following table details inputs to the Black Scholes pricing model, used to value the cost of the share schemes to the Group.

Main contents
Financial contents

The 61,498 relinquished shares under the May 2016 share scheme, held by the Share Trustee, still remain outstanding as the share trustee has yet
to release these on the market.
During the year no shares were issued under a rights issue for shares held in the employee share scheme (Dec 2020 - Nil) .

Accounting policies
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement of financial
performance with a corresponding increase in the share reserve. For the Grower Loyalty Share Scheme (GLSS), the fair value of the grower loyalty
received in exchange for the grant of the option is recognised as a discount against revenue in the statement of financial performance with a
corresponding increase in share reserve. The fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, calculated using the Black
Scholes pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those shares is transferred to retained earnings.
Employee share scheme shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average Price
(VWAP) calculation of the Company's shares during the period prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with further shares
if that issue would result in the ESS having an interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.
Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the debt
between ESS and GLSS and the Group on behalf of the employee of the grower.
Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited to share capital when payment for the shares is received.
The ESS and GLSS have a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated to employees and growers. Annually the Group reviews the ESS scheme and
decides upon the allocation of further shares and the price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS and GLSS are appointed for
an unspecified term and may be removed by the Company at any time.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The initial fair values of the employee share scheme and grower loyalty share scheme require estimates to be made of expected price volatility and
the risk free rate as detailed in this note.

Total dividend 2021

Dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend
reinvestment plan. Cash dividend payments made to and on behalf of shareholders during the year were $11.72m (Dec 2020 - $2.73m), including
the dividend declared in December 2020 and paid in January 2021.
On 16 December 2020, the directors declared a fully-imputed special dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend was paid 27 January 2021 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 24 December 2020. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with a 2% discount to the strike price. The
Board declared the special dividend following the stronger than expected earnings in 2020 due to tight financial management and the settled sale
and lease back of part of the Australian kiwifruit orchard portfolio.
During the year, the dividends declared and paid in 2020 were reviewed and amended for the NRWT on dividends paid to international
shareholders, resulting in an adjustment of $0.08m.
On 25 February 2021, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend was paid 30 March 2021 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 5 March 2021. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with a 2% discount to the strike price.
On 18 August 2021, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend was paid 13 October 2021 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 20 September 2021. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with a 2% discount to the strike price.
On 20 January 2022, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend will be paid 23 February 2022 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 28 January 2022. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price.

Accounting policies
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the period but not distributed at balance date.

of Te Kaha which supply kiwifruit to the Group. The value of the Group's investment at acquisition date was $0.88m. During the period from
acquiring the investment and balance date, the Group has received $0.76m of distributions.

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the voting rights in
the entity or exercising significant influence via directors on the Board.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost.
The Group's share of associates profits or losses are recognised in the statement of financial performance and the carrying amount of the investment in
the statement of financial position.
Dividends or distributions received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

The Apanui Road Joint Venture investment is considered a joint operation based on the following:
– There is equal voting rights and influence;
– There is no investment vehicle that separates it from the parties to the arrangement; and,
– The legal form and contractual arrangements through which the investee operates give the parties rights to the individual assets and liabilities
of the investee (rather than the net assets as a whole).
The orchards of Apanui Road Orchards Joint Venture have a finite life, are carried at their fair value and are included in the consolidated financial
statements.

Accounting policies
Investment in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and
obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
Joint operations
The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings.
Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the statement of financial position.

28. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to
producing and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate
financial risks related to credit, liquidity and capital risk. The Group
operates a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation programme
via its Audit and Risk Committee.
The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value and
maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders,
as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources are available for the
development of the Group’s business whilst managing its financial risks.

a. Risk management strategies related to orcharding,
post harvest and retail operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production and
market returns. The main short-term production risks are weather
events, diseases, and pests. These impact on volume and quality
of produce from the Group's orchards, volumes to post harvest
(both from Group orchard operations and independent growers)
and volumes available to the retail business. The primary risk to the
completion of the coming harvest is the limited availability of labour
and the risk of a Covid-19 lockdown. The Group is also impacted by the
long-term effects of climate change.
Market risks include price and exchange rate impact on orchard
operations (the amount the Group is paid for crops grown by the
Group) and impact on retail revenues where the Group imports and
sells produce, mainly bananas. The exchange rate risk on imports is
managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts to match
known and planned purchases. Market risks do not directly impact on
post harvest operations, as charges are normally set prior to harvest
and deducted before sales revenues are paid to supplying growers.
The Group operates in five regions spread over two countries; New
Zealand's Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne and the Bay of Plenty,
and in Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce lines
are kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears and avocados, with small
production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail activities
are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce), Australia
and Asia. The Group's geographical, product and market spread limits
the impact on Group operations from an adverse event occurring in a
specific region, produce or market. To further mitigate risks, the Board
uses the following strategies.
Production risks - weather events, disease and pests
The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production risks.
This includes orchard management practices to optimise production from
Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure post harvest and retail
services are suitably resourced to manage each season's crop volumes.
In New Zealand the major climatic risks are hail, frost, storm damage
and drought.
– Hail events are typically highly localised, and for kiwifruit the Group has
access to industry hail insurance for its orchard operations, plus top-up
payments from a Seeka Growers Limited hail insurance programme.
– Frost events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including active frost management
on kiwifruit orchards operated by the Group and other growers
supplying the Group's post harvest operations.
SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

– Storm events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including shelter belts on all orchards
operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's
post harvest operations.
– Drought events are typically regional, and the Group has invested
in irrigation in many of its orchards. The Group is also investing in
localised weather measurement on its orchards.
In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As the
owner and operator of all orchards supplying its Australian operations,
the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total production base.
The orchards are located on three sites in the Mundoona region.
– Drought events are typically regional, and to secure adequate
irrigation, the Group has purchased extensive, long-term water
shares from a reliable irrigation programme.
– Hail events are typically localised, and the Group currently has hail
cloth protecting one orchard.
– Fire risk is typically from serious grass wild-fire occurring during
periods of extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority
responsible for risk assessment and management of fire events.
The Group takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk
including removing excess vegetation from Group properties.
All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest
incursions. The kiwifruit vine disease Pseudomonas syringae pv.
actinidiae (Psa) is widespread throughout New Zealand, and is being
actively managed. In 2018 Psa was detected on the Group's kiwifruit
orchards in Australia. Seeka has moved to contain the outbreak and
works to proactively monitor the orchards. The Queensland fruit
fly and brown marmorated stink bug are potential threats to the
horticulture industry. To minimise the risk of crop loss the Group
monitors its orchards and undertakes recognised spray programmes
to protect crops to the fullest extent possible. Seeka also relies on the
Ministry for Primary Industries to protect New Zealand's borders from
introduced diseases.
Labour availability and Covid-19
Border closures due to Covid-19 have reduced the workforce that
Seeka relies on through the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE)
scheme and from backpackers. To assist the horticulture industry
the New Zealand Government made a provision for an additional
2,000 seasonal workers to enter the country in 2021, of which Seeka
accessed its share of 217 employees. Seeka has an extensive local
recruitment process underway, including working with the Ministry
for Social Development (MSD) and iwi on methods of recruiting
unemployed people into the Seeka workforce.
For 2022, the New Zealand Government has opened access to
seasonal workers from Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu, from which Seeka
has the ability to employ up to 1200 seasonal employees.
Long-term climate change
As a horticultural based business, Seeka is exposed to the long-term
impact of climate change through potential reduced production crop
yields. In addition to responding to weather events, future regulatory
change may impact Seeka through revised policies that limit the use
of chemical inputs on orchards, require soil monitoring and reporting,
introduce carbon taxes, and implement water restrictions.
63

Main contents
Financial contents

To respond to this Seeka is;

Australian produce

– Working closely with regional councils and regulators to assist in
regulation change;

The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all
Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian
operations. As the largest single grower and supplier of Australian
kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong
relationships with key retailers. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns.

– Actively engaged in developing orchard management practices to
measure the environmental impact on orchards;
– Measuring the carbon footprint of Seeka's operations, with a
number of carbon-reduction initiatives underway;
– Ensuring new developments undertaken by Seeka include water
accessibility as part of the development design, whether via stream
access, onsite storage, or developing wetlands; and
– Reporting orchards by altitude to assess the risk of rising sea levels.
Market returns
New Zealand kiwifruit
The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit
harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing activities
beyond Australia are undertaken by Zespri Group Limited (Zespri)
under statutory regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the
level of Zespri's market returns which impact on the Group's orchard
profitability. The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling
techniques to analyse current and projected orchard income. This
information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease
terms.
New Zealand avocado and kiwiberry
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocado and
kiwiberry, with half of kiwiberry sales and all avocado sales managed
by the Group's retail operations. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns. This information is used when
setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.
The Group has no direct currency risk from export sales as it does not
own the products but acts as the growers’ agent.
Imported tropical produce
The Group has a direct market, price and currency risk from imported
fruit produce (banana, pineapple and papaya) where the Group
imports fruit produce for sale as the principal through its supply
and sale contracts. The Group may hedge up to the total known and
projected cash flows to manage exchange risk. The Group has no
material direct price and currency risk from imported fruit produce
where the supply agreement enables the Group to amend its purchase
price according to trading conditions.

Seeka Australia is the Group’s single major international operation,
exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk
includes future commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net
investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed through
borrowings in Australian dollars, see note 30.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
customers, including outstanding receivables, derivative financial
instruments and committed transactions.
The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if
counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The Group's
maximum exposure is the carrying amount of the respective recognised
financial assets as stated in the statement of financial position.
For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their
subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require any
collateral or security to support financial instruments due to the
quality of the financial institutions.
For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals
predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post
harvest services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is
therefore not considered significant.
Trade receivables
The Group applies the NZ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (NZ IFRS 9)
simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been
grouped based on days past due. The expected loss rates are based on
the payment profiles of sales over a 12 month period before 31 December
2021 and the corresponding historical credit losses during this period,
adjusted for any significant known amounts that are not recoverable.

On that basis, the following table details the provision for doubtful debts.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in
meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.

When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are
invested in interest bearing current accounts.

The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows,
liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants,
to ensure that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate
committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet
its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow
forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.

At balance date, the Group had $190.41m (Dec 2020 - $122.26m) of
available credit of which $113.00m (Dec 2020 - $83.02m) was drawn.
All credit lines are currently provided by a bank syndicate comprised
of five lenders across New Zealand and Australia, where Westpac New
Zealand Limited acts as the syndicate agent lender, security trustee
and lead lender.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

375,426

Shareholder equity ratio

51.11%

46.96%

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings times
interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position as
investment in shares and water shares within intangible assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities, only
some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial performance
whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance is available. When no such reserve exists, any related loss is processed directly in the statement
of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.

29. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The different levels are defined as:

– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement
date. Instruments in level 1 are comprised of water shares.

– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to
be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant
would use when determining an appropriate price.

Accounting policies
Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be
estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes. Fair value measurements are categorised into a three-level
hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation techniques
used.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such
as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and investment in shares)
is based on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The
quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the
current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial
liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active
market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined
using valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses the
appropriate method and makes assumptions that are based on market
conditions at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer
quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments
held.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows. Other techniques, such as
estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for
the remaining financial instruments.
Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade
receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values
due to their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and
liabilities with unobservable (level 3 inputs), reflects the assumptions
that market participants would use when determining an appropriate
price; additional disclosure is provided for the inputs and assumptions
used in such cases.
Land and buildings
Fair value is based on an annual revaluation, which is performed
on land and buildings based on a rolling three-year cycle by an
independent valuer, with approximately one third of land and buildings
assets valued each year using four different approaches as described
in note 10.

Group bank loans currently bear an average variable interest rate of 3.0% (Dec 2020 – 2.3%), with the Group using interest rate swaps to protect
the term portion of the loans.
Swaps cover 83% (Dec 2020 - 46%) of the term liabilities at balance date and are classified as held for trading or as cash flow hedges.

Term loan

The fair values of the interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts are determined by Westpac New Zealand Limited and
reviewed by the Board.
The gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income
appear in the statement of financial performance.
Hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge
relationship and through annual prospective effectiveness
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between
the hedged item and hedging instrument.

Accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their
fair value at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised
as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative
is designated and effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the
hedge relationship. Derivatives are classified as current or non-current
based on the effective date.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At
the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
68

The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms
as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates,
maturities and notional amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of
its loans, therefore the hedged item is identified as a proportion of the
outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the swaps.
Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:
– the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps
which is not matched by the loan, and
– differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans.
There was no material ineffectiveness during 2021 or 2020 in relation
to the interest rate swaps.

Cash flow hedge
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge
relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,
exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging
instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time
remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement
of financial performance. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported
in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the
statement of financial performance within other gains / (losses).
Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation
technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are
applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are based
on quoted market rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by
Westpac New Zealand Limited.

Accounting policies
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following
categories in accordance with NZ IFRS 9:
– amortised cost for financial assets and liabilities,

Financial instruments are not reclassified subsequent to their initial
recognition unless the Group changes its business model in which case
all affected financial instruments are reclassified on the first day of the
first reporting period following the change in the business model.

– assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI),

A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets both
of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL:

– assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL),

– it is held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows; and

– liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and

– its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding.

– other financial liabilities.
The classification of financial assets and liabilities under NZ IFRS
9 is generally based on the business model in which the financial
instrument is managed and its contractual cash flows characteristics.
On initial recognition, a financial instrument is classified as measured
at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for
trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent
changes in the investment’s fair value in other comprehensive income.
The election is made on an investment by investment basis.
All financial instruments not classified as measured at amortised cost
or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.

Description of the key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Accounting for the acquisition of
Ōpōtiki Packaging and Cool Storage
Limited (OPAC)
On 4 May 2021 the Group acquired the
OPAC business. Seeka issued shares
worth $38.7 million as the consideration to
OPAC’s shareholders, as disclosed in
note 19.
Management have applied judgement in
estimating acquisition fair values for the
following material assets:
● land and buildings of $39.5 million
(based on their independent property
valuation expert’s report); and
● property, plant and equipment
(excluding land and buildings) of
$11.8 million.
In accounting for the transaction
management also applied judgement in
determining whether to recognise
any identifiable intangibles on acquisition,
including grower relationships and
contracts, and, where applicable, the fair
value of intangibles identified.
Following the measurement of the
consideration and identifiable assets and
liabilities, goodwill of $7.6 million was
recognised from the acquisition.
This was determined to be a key audit
matter due to the financial significance
and complexity of the transaction,
including management judgement in
determining the fair value of assets and
liabilities and whether there were any
identifiable intangible assets that should
be recognised on acquisition.

Our audit focused on the significant management
estimates and judgements used in establishing the fair
values of acquired assets and liabilities. Our
procedures included:
● Obtaining an understanding of the acquisition,
including the key terms and conditions and assets
and liabilities acquired, by reading relevant
agreements and documents;
● Reviewing relevant information such as vendor
financial statements, the acquisition due diligence
reports, the property valuation report from
management’s expert, Group Board minutes and
significant contracts (including grower contracts)
to assess the completeness of the acquired assets
and liabilities;
● Gaining an understanding of the valuation
approach and methodology undertaken by
management to identify separately identifiable
intangible assets and to determine the fair value of
the assets and liabilities acquired;
● Considering whether the recognition and
measurement of acquired tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities was consistent with the
requirements of the accounting standards;
● Testing the completeness, accuracy, relevance
and mathematical accuracy of the source data
used within the valuations;
● Engaging our auditor’s valuation expert to:
‒ assess the valuation approach and
methodology undertaken by management’s
expert in relation to the acquired land and
buildings;
‒ evaluate management’s approach to valuing
plant and equipment at fair value;
‒ evaluate the completeness of and valuation
approaches for the identified intangible assets;
● Considering the independence and competence of
management’s property valuation expert; and
● Considering the sufficiency of disclosures in the
financial statements.
As a result of our procedures we have no matters to
report.

Description of the key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of land and buildings
As reflected in note 10 of the financial
statements, the Group has a policy of
revaluing their land and buildings on a
three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets
under construction). At each balance date
approximately one-third of the Group’s
properties are revalued by an independent
external valuer using a combination of
four different approaches to arrive at a fair
value.
The Group then utilises their internal
valuation expertise to evaluate whether,
based on the results of the third party
valuations and other recent market data,
the remaining New Zealand and Australia
asset values remain appropriate and
materially reflect fair value.
The total value of the Group’s land and
buildings at year end is $228.5 million.
We included the valuation of land and
buildings as a key audit matter because of
the level of judgement inherent in the
valuations.

Our audit of the land and buildings of the Group
focused on the judgements inherent in the valuation of
those assets.
Our procedures included:
● Assessing the independence, objectivity and
competence of the third party valuers;
● Engaging our in-house valuation expert to
challenge the work performed by the third party
valuers and assess the reasonableness of the
assumptions used, such as capitalisation and
discount rates, based on their knowledge gained
from reviewing valuations of similar properties,
known transactions and available market data;
● Reviewing and challenging management’s
assessment of the carrying values of the Group’s
land and buildings not independently revalued
during 2021 by comparing our own independent
assessment of valuation ranges using our PwC
valuation expert; and
● Reviewing the adequacy of the disclosures in the
financial statements.
As a result of our procedures we have no matters to
report.

Goodwill impairment tests
As at 31 December 2021, the carrying
amount of the Group’s goodwill amounted
to $17.2 million as disclosed in note 11, of
which $14.7 million and $1.8 million
related to the Bay of Plenty post harvest
and Northland post harvest cash
generating units (CGUs) respectively.
Management has performed impairment
testing for each CGU on a value-in-use
basis, using a discounted cash flow model
based on forecast future performance to
determine the recoverable amount. No
impairment was identified.

Our audit focused on assessing and challenging the
significant estimates and assumptions used by
management in the impairment tests for the Bay of
Plenty and Northland post harvest CGUs, being the
largest CGUs, along with evaluating the overall Group
impairment test.
Our procedures included:
● Evaluating the appropriateness of the CGUs,
including the changes made to the definition of the
Group’s CGUs during the year;
● Agreeing the cash flows included in
management’s impairment model for each CGU to
the latest board approved five year plan and
budget for the year ending 31 December 2022;
● Assessing the Group’s forecasting accuracy by
comparing historical forecasts to actual results;
● Evaluating the key cash flow assumptions by
obtaining from management a detailed analysis of
the forecast supply of trays to the packhouses,
revenue and earnings per tray, and overheads.
We compared this information to historical
outcomes and our assessment of the feasibility of
management’s plans;

Description of the key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

The impairment testing of goodwill is
considered a key audit matter due to the
significant level of management
judgement applied in estimating the future
performance and cash flows for the Group
and material CGUs, along with the
discount rate and terminal growth rate
used in estimating the recoverable
amounts.

Using our in-house valuation expert we reviewed
whether the discount rate used by management
for each CGU was reasonable. We also compared
it to relevant industry comparators. Our expert
also assessed the terminal growth rates used;
● Testing the accuracy of the calculations in
management’s impairment model for each CGU,
and checking the carrying amount of the CGU’s
net assets was correct;
● Performing a sensitivity analysis across a range of
reasonably possible changes in the discount rate,
cash flow assumptions and terminal growth rate;
and
● Reviewing the adequacy of the disclosures in the
financial statements.
As a result of our procedures we have no matters to
report.
●

Our audit approach
Overview

Overall group materiality: $2,630,000, which represents
approximately 0.85% of revenue.
We chose revenue as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the
benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most
commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted
benchmark. The Group operates in a high-volume low margin
industry where net profit is not representative of the scale of the
Group.
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement, we:
●

Selected two entities for full scope audits

●

Performed specified audit procedures and analytical review
procedures on the remaining entities

As reported above, we have three key audit matters, being:
●

Accounting for the acquisition of Ōpōtiki Packaging and Cool
Storage Limited (OPAC)

●

Valuation of land and buildings

●

Goodwill impairment tests

Main contents
Financial contents

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material
misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made
subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits,
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other
matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of the financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall Group materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out above. These,
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit, the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.
How we tailored our group audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting
processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The materiality levels applied in the full scope audits of the New Zealand and Australian businesses
were calculated by reference to a portion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the
business concerned (New Zealand), or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes
where the statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation (Australia).
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to
the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of
the financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as the
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

PwC

Main contents
Financial contents

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements, as a
whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the
External Reporting Board’s website at:

This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Who we report to
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume

Governance

Corporate governance statement
As at 31 December 2021
At Seeka, we conduct our business safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best outcomes for our
growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.
Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the recommendations in the NZX Corporate
Governance Code, 10 December 2020 (the Code). Our practices are set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews
Seeka's corporate governance structures against the eight principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures
substantially meet Code recommendations. Any exceptions are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 86 of this annual report.
Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.
The Board approved this governance statement on 18 February 2022.

Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
followed throughout the organisation.”
Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.
Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”
Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are promoted
to staff each year including at staff meetings. The code outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and
model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”
The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:
• Conflicts of interest
• Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property
• Conduct, valuing individuals' differences and respecting all stakeholders
• Dealing with gifts or gratuities
• Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing
• Compliance with laws and Seeka policies
• Managing breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics
Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy that applies to the Seeka team of directors, officers, senior managers and all employees, that prohibits
team members from direct or indirect dealing in Seeka financial products when holding inside information, plus a duty of confidentiality that protects
the dissemination and use of confidential company information.
The Insider Trading Policy defines black-out periods during which restricted persons (defined below) are prohibited from trading in Seeka shares
unless provided with a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to, and finishes the first trading day after, key
events; being the half-year and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares.
Restricted persons includes all directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts
and companies controlled by such persons, and advisors. The policy also specifies that Seeka team members should not engage in short-term trading.
Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chair of the Board, and the chair must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.
No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.

Principle 2. Board composition and performance

Governance

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board Charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the duties
and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:
• Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards
• Establishing corporate objectives and strategies
• Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies
• Overseeing high standards of ethical behaviour
• Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance
• Managing risk to Seeka’s business
• Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication
The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.

Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth
to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings for Board succession planning. On 1 September 2021, an eighth director Robert Farron was
appointed to the Board. Robert Farron will offer himself for election at the 2022 annual shareholders meeting and John Burke and Amiel Diaz will
retire, at which point the Board will have six directors.
Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at
least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between governance and management, all directors are non-executive
and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.
Seeka’s Board is led by the independent chair Fred Hutchings. Non-independent director Amiel Diaz is the only director residing overseas.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.
Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;
• Amiel Diaz (retiring April 2022), representative of Seeka’s shareholder Sumifru Singapore Pte Limited, and
• Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chair of the Ngai Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit
grower supplying Seeka.
As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors have extensive
experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their extensive interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are considered nonindependent directors;
• Martyn Brick
• John Burke (retiring April 2022), and
• Ratahi Cross

Governance

The Board has four independent directors;
• Fred Hutchings, Board chair and remuneration committee chair
• Ashley Waugh, audit and risk committee chair,
• Cecilia Tarrant, sustainability committee chair, and
• Robert Farron (appointed 1 September 2021)

Director appointments and induction
As required, the chair establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.
Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the Group’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
Board.
The chair undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the nominations
committee and external advisors.

While there is no maximum term, the Board annually reviews director length of service and any potential impact on director independence. When the
Board recommends the re-election of a director whom has served longer than 12 years, they will explain to shareholders their rationale for supporting
re-election.
At the April 2022 annual shareholders meeting, Amiel Diaz having served 12 years as a director, will retire by rotation and has not offered himself for
re-election, and John Burke, having served ten years as a director, will retire.

Director profiles
Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 87 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 89 of this annual report.

Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.
The Board works to optimise diversity across directors, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity in culture
and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key clients,
creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns. Notably Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is a lecturer
in Māori history, Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia, and Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural
backgrounds.

Professional development
Directors are supported to undertake professional development through individual training and by attending relevant courses.

Evaluation of board, committee and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chair undertakes an annual review of Board, committee and director performance. The chair's 2021 review found
that the Board, committees and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified by the Board
Charter.

Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”
The Board has established three permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.
All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the sustainability, remuneration and nominations committee charters biennially and the audit and risk committee charter annually.

Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board, except during succession planning when an eighth director may be appointed until the
next annual shareholders meeting, at which point the Board reverts to seven directors. To provide effective and transparent committee governance,
while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent director, with
committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill set. The audit and risk committee
charter specifies a majority of independent directors.
The current standing committees are:

1. Fred Hutchings retired from the audit and risk committee on 30 September 2021, and attended a further 4 meetings after this date in an ex officio capacity.
2. Robert Farron was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2021, and to the audit and risk committee on 1 October 2021.

Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”
Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a midyear performance update, along with regular operational updates to growers.
Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chair of the Board, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for
identifying material information between Board meetings. At every Board meeting the Board considers whether its deliberations and decisions trigger
a need for a disclosure to the NZX.
As stewards of more than 400 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and international
guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P standard for good
agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food. See www.globalgap.org.
Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.
In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit returns;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.
82

ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Governance

Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual financial statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides management
support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational performance for their fruit.
Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. Seeka also considers environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any environmental factors that may
materially affect operations.
Seeka has a sustainability committee to provide strategic guidance on Seeka's sustainability framework, targets, measures and performance. Seeka
is working to measure and improve our environmental performance and in our 2021 interim report we published the Group's carbon footprint for
2019. We know our orcharding and supply chain operations influence our environment, and we are actively addressing the risks and opportunities
of climate change. The sustainability committee provides guidance to the Seeka Agile Sustainability Team (SAST). Drawing together staff who
are passionate about sustainability from all areas of our operations, and working with external advisors, Seeka's sustainability team is working
to integrate sustainability into the hearts and minds of our employees and deliver projects that reduce Seeka’s environmental footprint. Seeka is
committed to annually reporting our sustainability initiatives and have engaged Toitu Envirocare to independently verify our environmental footprint
calculations. Seeka's third annual Sustainability report is included in this document.

Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chair uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration
within a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in
April 2021, when the pool limit was set at $530,000 per annum. During the year, R Farron was appointed to the Board and due to the increase in the
number of directors the total fees paid exceeded the pool limit by $5,833, as permitted under NZX Rule 2.11
Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according to expected time commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board.
Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and receive no performance or retirement benefits. Directors are encouraged but not required to
own Seeka shares. Director shareholdings are disclosed on page 90.
The following table reports the annual allocation of the pool at the date of this report, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. No other

Chief executive officer remuneration
The review of the chief executive’s remuneration is undertaken by the remuneration committee with the remuneration package the responsibility of
the Board. Michael Franks was appointed chief executive in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual remuneration that covers base
salary, vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.

Governance

Performance incentive
The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 73% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set by the Board,
including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For FY21, the chief executive officer earned a $470,063
performance incentive (94% of the possible payable incentive.) This incentive was paid in December 2021 (FY20 - $388,988, paid early 2021).
Employee share scheme
At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated April 2019 at $4.76 per share under the 2019 employee share scheme. These shares
vest 2022.

Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”
The Board considers risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific
focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.
While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
Principles and Guidelines.
Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
performance against budget and forecasts.
The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian produce handling
and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia (when practicable with regard to Covid-19 travel restrictions)
to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.
The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated
with being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing
revenue from more points along the value chain.
Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post harvest processing and fruit handling facilities.
The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB; Halyomorpha halys) remains one of the top pests of concern for New Zealand's horticultural industry. A
native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and accidentally introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s, adult BMSB feed on fruit and make them
unmarketable. The Ministry of Primary Industries is working with industry groups along with the public to prevent the unintended import of BMSB,
including eradication protocols if BMSB are detected in New Zealand. Seeka personnel and supplying growers are informed on how to identify BMSB
and the immediate actions to be undertaken if the pest is found.
Communicable diseases are a risk to labour availability, food safety and market access. Seeka works with industry bodies, the Government,
community agencies and international groups to secure reliable labour. Risk to food safety and market access is managed through Seeka's full
orchard-to-market track and trace service, which includes a register of all orchard visits and finger-scanner access to post harvest facilities. Tracing
from point of origin to point of sale allows Seeka to manage risk from contagion and ensures our markets can have confidence in the safety of our
supply chain and our products. Seeka's response to the communicable disease Covid-19 is detailed in the following health and safety section.

Health and safety
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.
Seeka has a Covid-19 response committee to protect our people and prepare our business. We have worked with health professionals, secured
personal protective equipment, and used social distancing protocols to mitigate risk and keep our people safe as we deliver an essential service. This
includes using operational “bubbles”, onsite personnel temperature logging, touchless signing in, the provision of personal protective equipment, twometre screening, enlarged break areas, 24-hour cleaning and remote management.
Seeka is part of a community effort that kept our whānau safe as collectively we worked to harvest our growers' crops and supply the world with safe,
healthy food. This included operating an essential service from Auckland New Zealand and Victoria Australia, during prolonged periods of community
lockdown in FY21.
Our people work in multiple, complex environments, and we focus on building safety into everything we do. This included instilling Seeka's safety
culture as we amalgamated OPAC and Orangewood in FY21. Over the full year, the Group employed more than 4700 people, with Group salary and
wages equating to 1915 full time equivalents.

2. Permanently disabled or requiring immediate in-patient hospitalisation.

Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”
Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the markets
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.
The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit
process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk committee:
• Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and
• Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.
For FY21, Troy Florence of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for the Group. Troy replaced Pip Cameron of PwC who completed
her five-year term as Seeka’s Auditor at the end of FY20.
PwC has confirmed its independence to the audit and risk committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the reporting period.
PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.
In FY21, PwC was paid $493,000 for audit fees and expenses, and $261,000 for tax compliance, consulting, planning, structuring and due diligence,
tax pooling and debt covenant compliance certificate agreed upon procedures.
To further increase auditor independence, in FY21, Seeka appointed BDO as its tax compliance agent.

Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
external audit findings.
Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated financial audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s financial systems.
Directors also pay attention to matters raised by PwC, the external auditor.

Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”
Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering excellence to all stakeholders.
The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
• Annual and interim reports
• Market announcements
• Annual shareholder meeting
• Mid-year stakeholder meeting
• Ad-hoc investor presentations
• Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type
• Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors
• Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team
Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update via the online portal, or where
practicable in person, where they can raise matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which
affect Seeka at the annual shareholder meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the
company’s auditor PwC, on a one share, one vote principle.

Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar
Link Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. Notices of shareholder meetings are posted on the NZX website and Seeka's website. Where
circumstances allow, Seeka sends notices of shareholder meetings at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements
can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.
When raising new capital, when practical the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company on a pro

The following table summarises the material differences between Seeka’s corporate governance and the Code during the year. Where there are
differences, these have been approved by the Board.
Principle
2. Board
Composition
and
Performance

Concerning
2.8 A majority of the board
should be independent
directors.

Period of non
compliance

Key difference
The Constitution and Board Charter specify a minimum of two independent directors.
As Seeka's foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers it appropriate to have
a mix of directors with extensive experience in kiwifruit production and handling, who
in the normal course of business would supply Seeka with produce from their ongoing
orcharding interests. The Board must also appropriately represent large shareholders.

At all relevant
times

The specified minimum of two independent directors provides the flexibility to meet
these two criteria, while also ensuring Board decisions reflect the best interests of
Seeka and its security holders.
From 1 January to 1 September 2021, only three out of seven directors (a minority)
were deemed independent and four non-independent; two for their extensive interests
in orchards that supply Seeka (industry expertise), one an appointee of a large

On 4 May 2021, Seeka issued 7,042,574 new ordinary shares (with shareholder
approval) which were exchanged for OPAC shares, and on 22 November a further
639,302 shares which were exchanged with cash for Orangewood shares. The Board
considered these issues were an effective method to secure the amalgamation of
these two businesses, would benefit all shareholders from the enlarged Seeka business
and, as most OPAC and Orangewood shareholders are also growers, supports their
supply of kiwifruit and further strengthens Seeka's alignment with growers.

and
22 November

On 30 March 2021, Seeka issued a notice for the annual shareholders meeting for
16 April 2021. The notice was less than 20 working days prior to the ASM. It was
issued later than customary so Seeka could include a resolution relating to the
proposed OPAC acquisition and share issue that was announced five days prior.
Seeka intends to provide shareholders with at least 20 working days' notice of
shareholder meetings where practicable.

Remuneration includes key performance indicator payments. Remuneration by the Group’s Australian subsidiary Seeka Australia in Australian dollars
was converted to New Zealand dollars using the average exchange rate for the year. The impact of movements in exchange rates from FY20 to FY21
was reviewed and would not have significantly changed the employee remuneration disclosure.

As part of their employment benefits, eligible permanent employees are invited to participate in Seeka’s employee share ownership scheme.
In March 2019, offers under Seeka's employee share ownership scheme were made and 568,000 shares were allocated to permanent employees at
