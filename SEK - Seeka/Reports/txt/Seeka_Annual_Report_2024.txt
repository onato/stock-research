Our operations
Seeka delivers orcharding, post harvest and retail
services to the fresh produce industry. We help grow
highly-nutritious crops and our supply chain links local
orchards to the international markets. We supply the
global marketer Zespri and directly service large-format
retailers in Australia, Asia and New Zealand.

Seeka's strategy
In 2024 we progressed Seeka's strategy to connect the
world with a sustainable supply of quality produce.
Delivered operational excellence to our growers

Harvest management allowed growers to target harvest and
storage premiums, with quality fruit delivered on time and in spec
to the markets.

Lifted financial performance to our shareholders

Seeka generated a record profit, restarted dividend payments,
lowered capital expenditure and significantly lowered bank debt.

Optimised post-harvest capacity

Automation projects at KKP, Oakside and Gisborne lifted site
throughput, and delivered efficiency gains to supplying growers
and Seeka shareholders.

Building revenue streams

As Seeka's core NZ kiwifruit business returned to profitability,
revenue from complementary services continues to grow, including
the packing of persimmon and citrus, banana import and ripening,
and Seeka's wholesale market.

Select Excellence

In 2024 Seeka progressed our aspiration to deliver excellent
service, produce and value to our stakeholders.

From the Chair and Chief Executive

We are pleased to present Seeka Limited's annual report for the year
ended 31 December 2024. Seeka's clear strategy and strong business
unit performance have delivered an excellent service and results to our
growers, and record operating profits for shareholders.
It’s a pleasing turnaround driven by:
–

the strategic steps taken to reduce regional risk through diversification,

–

improved operational performance,

–

close management of costs and capital expenditure, and

–

better growing and weather conditions resulting in a significant increase in kiwifruit
volumes and quality.

Seeka’s improved financial position and compliance with long-term banking covenants
enabled the Board to resume dividends, with a 10 cents per share payment to shareholders
in January 2025. The Board has declared a further 5 cents per share dividend to be paid
15 April 2025. This will deliver dividend payments of 15 cents per share from the 2024
financial year.
Seeka enters 2025 in a much stronger financial position and is well positioned for the
future.

Higher volumes drive revenue growth
Seeka’s 2024 revenue of $411.4 million was up 37% on 2023’s $300.9 million.
The $110.5 million increase in revenue reflects higher volumes handled by Seeka’s New
Zealand and Australian operations, with better growing conditions benefitting yields in all
regions. Kiwifruit volumes to Seeka's New Zealand post-harvest operations were up 44%
to 43.0 million class 1 trays (2023 - 29.8 million trays), with Seeka’s Australian kiwifruit
production up 166% to 2.3 million kilograms (2023 – 0.9 million kgs).
With revenues up on higher volumes, all business units contributed to Seeka’s financial
performance.

Delivering the benefits of Seeka's strategy
Seeka’s strategy is to deliver operational excellence and an outstanding service. This
includes resolute attention to cost control and making investments that address risk and
enhance efficiency. The focus has been on fundamental earnings to improve profitability,
reduce debt and lift financial performance. Your Company has resolutely implemented its
strategy.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents

Restructuring in 2023 created a leaner organisation with innovative cost saving
mechanisms.
Prudent financial management together with higher fruit volumes have lifted financial
performance. Profit before tax was up 242% to $29.7 million, which is a $50.7 million
turnaround from a $21.0 million loss before tax in 2023.
Profit after tax was $8.8 million compared to a $14.5 million loss after tax in 2023. Seeka's
financial results in 2024 includes a $12.5 million one-off non-cash deferred tax charge due
to the government’s removal of tax deductibility of depreciation on buildings. Earnings per
share, excluding the deferred tax adjustment, were 51 cents, compared against 2023’s loss
of 35 cents per share.
Record profit before tax was achieved during a period of high interest rates and higher debt
levels. Seeka is set to benefit from lower interest rates, having also lowered net debt by
$35.1 million in 2024.
Seeka has operated with the full support of its banking syndicate and reestablished longterm covenant ratios. The focus is on prudent debt management and improving facility
utilisation. Capital investment has been held to maintenance levels, with a review of fire
risk at Seeka facilities driving the targeted renewal of core infrastructure to mitigate risk.
Seeka continues to review its asset mix and consider viable opportunities to sell and
leaseback facilities. No major assets were sold in 2024.
Management remains focused on improving profitability and directing cash flow to debt
reduction while sustainably investing in Seeka’s long-term future.

Improved growing conditions
In New Zealand, yields rebounded and total volumes increased. Growing conditions across
all regions were significantly better, although lingering water stress impacted production
from Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne and the Hawke’s Bay. To build resilience, growers in
these regions are switching to rootstocks that perform better in wet conditions.
While some wind damage occurred near Katikati, in the Te Puke, Ōpōtiki and wider Bay of
Plenty region, where Seeka sources about 85% of its kiwifruit, growing conditions were far
better than the prior two seasons and yields were excellent.
Seeka’s Australian operations also benefited from better growing conditions and a new
kiwifruit crop protection programme that enhances production in a Psa environment. Seeka
Australia produced 2.3 million kilograms of kiwifruit, up 166% on the prior year. The much
improved crop protection programme will benefit new orchards that are scheduled to start
producing in 2026.

Operational excellence
All aspects of Seeka's operations performed well. The detailed and disciplined planning
process together with a full labour supply and quality fruit from our growers, ensured all
fruit was packed and stored in an efficient and timely manner.
Labour supply constraints have eased with the industry benefitting from an increased
supply of workers for growing, harvesting and post-harvest operations. For the first time in
five years, post-harvest shifts were fully staffed across all regions.
The KKP automated packing machine, in its second full season of operation, continued
to deliver incremental performance improvements. Our mix of automated and manual
packlines gives Seeka the flexibility to efficiently handle variable fruit quality. Quality lines
with low rejects can be quickly and efficiently processed on Seeka’s highly automated
packing machines, while orchards with compromised fruit can be cared for with manual
grading. This mix of packing technology allowed Seeka to provide a timely harvest to
all supplying growers including those that had to contend with challenging growing
conditions.
Seeka’s continuing focus on quality has once again delivered low onshore fruit loss and
excellent offshore quality in 2024.

Capacity
Capacity was not stretched in 2024, positioning Seeka well for future volume increases.
Forward capacity planning remains key, and Seeka is carefully planning and navigating for
future crop in all growing regions.
Significant investments have been made in capacity and automation, with upgrades at
both Oakside and Seeka Gisborne enhancing capacity and throughput. Seeka continues to
invest in automation that delivers rewarding financial benefits.
In 2025 a new highly-automated packing machine will be commissioned in Kerikeri
in preparation for the 2026 season. Incorporating new technology and innovations,
the packline with be the most advanced and efficient in Seeka’s portfolio. The Kerikeri
investment will ensure Seeka has the capacity to handle Northland’s forecast volume
growth.
Seeka has invested in quality accommodation for seasonal workers, with Seeka’s Turanga
Whetu (“Star Base”) accommodation facility in Katikati, which opened in 2023, being
marketed for sale and leaseback. Current offers to purchase this facility are below
expectations.

Dividends
The Board declared a 10 cents per share dividend, which was paid to shareholders on
20 January 2025. The dividend was fully imputed and the dividend reinvestment plan
applied.
Following the finalisation of record net profit before tax, the Board has approved a further
dividend of 5 cents per share, bringing the total dividends related to 2024 to 15 cents per
share. The final dividend for 2024 will be paid on 15 April 2025.

Director changes
Ashley Waugh resigned from the Board on 31 December 2024, having been a director
since 2014. Ashley has chaired the Audit and Risk Committee and was involved with
Seeka’s growth including acquisitions of Aongatete, OPAC, New Zealand Fruits and
Orangewood.
Two new directors have been appointed; Mark Dewdney on 1 December 2024 and Hayley
Gourley on 1 January 2025.
Our thanks to Ashley for his service and a warm welcome to Mark and Hayley.

Forward focus
Seeka has been through an extended period of challenges, with last year’s low volumes,
in particular, impacting profitability. We have successfully managed these challenges and
come out stronger, with 2024’s record kiwifruit crop of 43 million class 1 trays restoring
profitability, and confirming the previous growth strategy through record profits at both
a company level and per share. The business has repaid debt, restored the dividend and
ended the year in a resilient position.
While it is too early to make a reliable prediction on 2025 crops, growing conditions have
been good and indicative volumes consistent or better than 2024. Having delivered a solid
operational performance, and achieved a high rate of pre-season grower signups, Seeka
enters 2025 in a good position.
Your Company and its people have worked hard to deliver an important turnaround in
results. We remain focused and committed to continuing improvements.
We thank our people, stakeholders and growers for their hard work and continuing
support.

Financial review

The profitability of Seeka's post-harvest and orcharding operations benefited from
improved kiwifruit volumes in 2024. Following two challenging growing seasons,
New Zealand kiwifruit production grew by 44%, aided by the rebound in yields and
a 5% increase in harvest area as more orchards enter production.
Net profit after tax
Seeka recorded net profit after tax of $8.8 million compared
to a loss of $14.5 million loss in the previous year. The profit
after tax was impacted by a one-off non-cash $12.5 million
deferred tax charge from the legislated removal of tax
deductibility of building depreciation. Normalised net profit
excluding this one-off charge would have been $21.2 million,
a $35.7 million increase on 2023.

Up 19% on FY23

25%

Seeka's orcharding operations grew 40% of the crop handled by
post-harvest in 2024. Production increased to 17.3 million class
1 trays of kiwifruit, up 52% on 2023's 11.4 million trays. Hayward
averaged 11,224 trays per hectare, up 67% on 2023, with SunGold
up 45% to 13,464 trays per hectare.
Seeka's managed portfolio of orchards produced 12.7 million trays of kiwifruit,
with the leased portfolio producing 4.6 million trays, up from 2.7 million in 2023.
Revenue per hectare was up 19% from better production.

of Group revenue

Seeka also grew 1,780 tonnes of avocado (2023: 1,900 tonnes) and 169 tonnes of
Kiwiberry (2022: 163 tonnes), on orchards which it either owned or managed.

Main revenue streams

2024 orchard operations revenue of $102.7 million was up $16.1 million, driven by
the rebound in yields. Higher revenues delivered a $5.2 million increase in EBITDA
to $6.2 million, up on 2023's $1.0 million.

Leased and long term leased
orchards: costs plus profit share
Managed orchards: costs plus

Seeka continues to co-invest alongside landowners and funding agencies to
develop high-value orchards, with 65 hectares currently under development with
long-term supply commitments. Seeka has also directly invested $7.1 million to
develop 15 hectares of kiwifruit and 13 hectares of avocado on long-term leased
land. Fruit volumes and the profitability of Seeka's orcharding operations are
expected to increase as these orchards reach full production.

Post-harvest
Led by GM Post-harvest, Paul Crone

Post-harvest packed 43.0 million class 1 trays of kiwifruit, up from 29.8
million trays in 2023, with Hayward volumes up 58% and SunGold up
37%. Post-harvest also packed avocado, citrus and persimmon.
Seeka’s kiwifruit packing operations started early so growers could access earlyharvest premiums. Fruit was moved between packhouses to optimise grower
returns and deliver machine and labour efficiency.
Kiwifruit inventory performance was excellent across all Seeka sites, with highquality, in-spec fruit delivered to the marketer Zespri.

of Group revenue

Avocado volumes improved on the prior season with better fruit quality plus
contract packing for third parties. Seeka continues to work with industry partners to
rationalise the avocado supply chain service.

Main revenue streams

Seeka also packed 14.0 million kilograms of citrus and 1.5 million kilograms of
persimmon on contract for third party marketers. Contract packing volumes and
revenue continue to grow, and improve asset utilisation in Northland and Gisborne.
Post-harvest revenue of $246.6 million was up 35% from last season (2023:
$182.4m) from the large increase in volumes. EBITDA was $84.5 million compared
to $43.8 million in 2023, as Seeka realised the efficiency gains from the highlyautomated facilities.
Targeted investments to optimise capacity from Seeka's post-harvest facilities,
including automation upgrades at Seeka Gisborne and Oakside, has Seeka well
positioned to handle 2025 kiwifruit volumes, with the network and capacity to pack
more fruit using significantly less labour.

Turnover was up 7% to $67.5 million. This flowed through to a 49%
increase in revenue to $30.9 million, supported by returns from
imported produce and SeekaFresh's wholesale market.
EBITDA of $2.6 million was in line with 2023, as weak export pricing contributed to
a challenging season for New Zealand avocado growers, and lowered SeekaFresh's
commission on avocado sales. This was balanced by stronger earnings from
SeekaFresh's tropical imports operations.
The extension of Seeka's operations into retailing continues to add valuable
revenue streams and Seeka is building volumes and momentum in this component
of our business; connecting produce to the market.
Seeka is working with industry partners to rationalise the supply chain and
marketing functions, and generate better returns while delivering optimum prices
to growers. Returns for Kiwiberry growers remain high.
SeekaFresh includes the production and sale of Kiwi Crush™ and avocado oil
from otherwise unmarketable fruit. Both initiatives contributed to Group earnings,
returned value to supplying growers, and further lifted the sustainability of supply
chain operations.

Kiwifruit volumes were up 166% and nashi up 10%, while pear
production was down 27% from seasonal growing conditions.

$19.2m
REVENUE
Up 85% on FY23

The kiwifruit volume uplift follows a new crop protection programme implemented
by Seeka to improve yields. Seeka’s crop handling innovations and new
products have delivered good results. Innovations continue with new varieties in
development that will bring new products to the market.

5%

Higher volumes flowed through to an 85% increase in revenue to $19.2 million, and
an EBITDA of $3.2 million.

of Group revenue

Seeka is forecasting strong growth in its Australian business, with $17.2 million
invested in new orchard developments, including 64 hectares of kiwifruit, new pear
varieties, and an expansion of jujube plantings.

Main revenue streams

Seeka is committed to reducing its emissions and the
environmental footprint of growing, handling and connecting
the world to quality fresh fruit. Seeka has transparently
reported its carbon footprint since 2019 and has set
meaningful targets to reduce emissions.
Seeka's approach to its environmental footprint is to prevent carbon
emissions, then to reduce, and offset as a last resort.
No carbon offsets were purchased between 2019 and 2024.

2024 performance
A 44% increase in kiwifruit volumes increased Seeka’s emissions in 2024.
More fruit had to be cooled, and stored for a longer period, increasing
electricity consumption and refrigerant loss. Seeka is progressively
improving coolstore efficiency and improving refrigerant use across its
facilities to reduce coolstore-related emissions.
A challenging avocado season increased category 3 emissions with
avocado air freighted to access new markets and improve grower returns.
Seeka is working to minimise transport emissions from the orchard to the
markets, while supporting sustainable fruit production.

Main contents
Financial contents

Basis of preparation
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements. Accounting policies
which are limited to a specific note are described in that note.

Reporting entity and statutory base

Basis of consolidation

The financial statements presented are those of the consolidated
Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as Seeka Limited or the
Company. The group, which is the Company and all subsidiaries
controlled by Seeka Limited, is referred to as the Group, Seeka, or
Seeka Group.

Subsidiaries

Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New
Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets
Conduct Reporting Entity for the purposes of the Financial Markets
Conduct Act 2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are
quoted on the NZX main board equity security market (NZX Main
Board).

Nature of operations
Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
In New Zealand the Group provides orchard management, orchard
leasing, post-harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit,
avocado, citrus, persimmon, and Kiwiberry industries. Seeka
manufactures and sells the Kiwi Crush™ and Kiwi Crushies product
range along with avocado oil. The Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported tropical produce, and operates a
wholesale market.
In Australia, Seeka owns, leases and operates orchards and associated
post-harvest assets, making the Group one of the largest producers
and suppliers of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier
of European pears, plus other fruits, including plums and jujube dates.

Summary of material accounting policies
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the
periods presented in the financial statements.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The financial statements for the Group have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the Financial Markets
Conduct Act 2013. The financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to
International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other
applicable financial reporting standards as appropriate for profitoriented entities. The Group financial statements also comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with
the exception of:

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets exchanged, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date the acquisition is
settled. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on
transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency (NZD) using the exchange rates prevailing during the month
of that transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the statement of
profit or loss. The presentational currency is the New Zealand dollar
(NZD).
Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of
which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
– Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Climate impact

The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning future
operational and financial performance. By definition, these judgements
may not always equal actual results. The estimates and judgements
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are identified in the notes
below. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and
are based on historical experience as adjusted for current market
conditions and other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Judgements underlying management’s estimates can be found in the
following notes to the financial statements.

The longer-term impacts of climate change continue to be analysed
and Seeka is mitigating these risks through regional diversification,
innovative growing techniques, and research and development. Climate
change brings both opportunities and risks for the business, which are
detailed in the climate reporting under the Aotearoa New Zealand
Climate Standards NZ CS 1-3. The risks and opportunities and
mitigation strategies that could impact the estimates and judgements
in the financial statements are incorporated where known. Unforeseen
events and the implications of these cannot be estimated with
certainty. See www.seeka.co.nz/climate-change for more details.

Going concern assumption
The Directors have carefully considered the ability of the Group to
operate as a going concern for at least the next 12 months from the
date of signing these financial statements.
The Directors have concluded that the Group will continue to operate
as a going concern and the financial statements are prepared on that
basis.

Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the
entity
In May 2024, the External Reporting Board (XRB) introduced NZ IFRS
18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (effective for
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027). This standard
replaces NZ IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The Group has
not yet assessed the impact of NZ IFRS 18.
There are no other accounting standards that are not yet effective that
will have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments engage in business activities that
earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a manner consistent
with the internal reports provided to the chief decision makers, being
the Directors, who regularly evaluate the allocation of resources
alongside operational outcomes, such as EBITDA and EBIT, and are
responsible for setting strategic direction.
The Group has five operating segments:
– Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary
services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the
retail sector.
– A single Australian operating segment covers the integrated supply
chain service for the Group’s Australian-grown fruit.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each
segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs
and other income from the sale of assets recorded in the statement
of profit or loss are allocated to All other segments. Transactions
between segments are conducted on normal commercial terms and at
market rates and are eliminated on consolidation.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations

Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and
internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This
includes fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and postharvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported fruit, and operates a wholesale market.
Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi
Crush™, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and
hospitals, along with post-harvest services for Kiwiberry.
All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower
services and overhead sections recorded in the condensed statement
of profit or loss, and impairment and revaluations of other assets not
attributed directly to any other segment. It also includes the gain on
sale from assets that had been classified as held for sale, and are not
attributed directly to any other segment.

Australian operations
The Group grows, provides post-harvest services, and retails all
produce from orchards the Group owns or leases in Australia. The
main products are kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears, jujubes and
plums which are primarily sold in Australia.

The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
orchard owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post-harvest operations
The Group provides post-harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
citrus and persimmon industries. This includes all crops from the
Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from
independent orchard owners.

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors
and management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expenses associated
with debt and leases (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large
investments in fixed and leased assets (EBITDA).

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

Main contents
Financial contents

Accounting policies
The Group’s major revenue streams are post-harvest operations,
orchard management, retail services and Australian operations in
accordance with NZ IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers (NZ
IFRS 15).
Post-harvest
The Group enters into two standardised post-harvest contracts:
– The first has two performance obligations; to collect the supply
of fruit via picking and transportation, and maturity testing. The
charges are separated in the contract. All revenue is recognised
when the service is performed.
– The second has three performance obligations; to pack fruit, to cool
and dispatch fruit, and to sell Class 2 fruit to authorised markets.
These are stand-alone services provided by the Group. Each
performance obligation has a separate transaction price detailed in
the contract and the obligations are recognised when services are
performed; packing revenue as fruit is packed, cooling revenue as
fruit is loaded out from cool storage, and Class 2 as fruit is sold and
delivered.
Orchard management
The Group enters into two orchard management contracts that are
largely standardised:
– The first has one performance obligation; to manage fruit growing.
Revenue is recognised as the service is performed and calculated at
cost plus a margin per the contract or at a fixed per-hectare charge.
The management fee included in the contract is recognised evenly
over the contract's 12 month period.
– The second has one performance obligation; to collect the supply
of fruit on short term or long term leased orchards. The transaction
price is determined using a forecasted OGR. Revenue is recognised
when crops are picked (in the June interim accounts for kiwifruit).
Retail services
The Group enters into three retail service contracts which are
customised to the service being offered:
– The first has one performance obligation; to sell fruit on the owner’s
behalf. As the sales agent, the Group only collects a marketer’s
commission which is recognised when the fruit is sold and delivered.

Principal versus agent relationship
A principal relationship is one where the Group has the performance
obligation to provide the good or service directly and has control of the
asset or has a right to direct the asset. An agency relationship is one
where the performance obligation is to arrange for the good or service
on behalf of the supplier. The Group currently has agent relationships
for the sale of some fruit and vegetables in the retail services segment.
Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations,
with post-harvest revenues recognised as services are provided and
orcharding revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail
revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New Zealand kiwifruit
are harvested from March to June, avocados from July to February, and
Kiwiberry from February to March. In Australia nashi and European
pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit from March to
May. As a result of these harvest timings around 45~70% of orchard
revenues are recognised in the first six months of the financial year.
Due to seasonal fluctuations, the timing of the provision of postharvest services can vary from year to year, however normally 70~85%
is recognised in the first six months of the financial year, but can be
impacted by seasonal fluctuations.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the
effective interest method.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.
Gain on sale of assets classified as held for sale
The gain on sale of assets classified as held for sale is recognised when
a sale and purchase agreement is unconditional and the consideration
is paid or payable at that date.
Insurance income
Insurance income is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.

– The second has one performance obligation; to either store or ripen
fruit. Revenue is recognised as the fruit is stored or ripened.
– The third has one performance obligation; to provide ordered
product. The transaction price is based on the agreed price with
revenue recognised when the fruit is sold and delivered.
Australia
The Group has one type of contract that is entered by the Australian
business; for the sale and supply of fruit.
– The fruit sale and supply contracts are entered on a one-to-one
basis with the fruit purchaser and are largely standardised. They
have one performance obligation; to provide the fruit to the
customer. The transaction price is based on the agreed price and
recognised when the fruit is sold and delivered.

During the year the Group recognised $0.05m of costs relating to the measurement of the employeee share scheme issued based on the Black
Scholes Model (Dec 2023 - Nil).

Accounting policies
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred, except where future economic benefits arise and they are
recorded as a prepayment.
Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are
recognised in other payables. The employee liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating
sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date,
and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability
in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit. Differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

The balance comprises temporary differences attributable to:

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future taxable
profits is probable and these losses will be utilised in the near future. $1.83m was recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax
losses (Dec 2023 - $5.76m).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.		

8. Events occurring after balance date
The Group has an unconditional sales agreement to sell its remaining orchard asset classified as held for sale, with settlement due 28 February 2025,
see note 9.
On 26 February 2025, the Group declared a further dividend of $0.05 per share in relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2024. The
dividend will be fully imputed, and the dividend reinvestment plan will apply. The dividend record date is 20 March 2025 and the dividend will be
distributed on 15 April 2025, see note 21.
There are no other material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements (Dec
2023 - nil).

Asset class

At 31 December 2024, a 13.5 hectare Northland orchard (Dec 2023 - 13.5 hectares) was classified as held for sale. No growing costs have been
attributed to the remaining orchard at 31 December 2024 as it is valued on a crop-off basis.
All assets classified as held for sale are included in the orchard operations segment.
Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition,
and the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within one year from the date of classification. The accounting standards
allow for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control.
As at 31 December 2024, one orchard of 13.5 hectares (Dec 2023 - one orchard of 13.5 hectares) has taken longer than 12 months to find a buyer,
however there is an unconditional sales agreement with settlement due 28 February 2025.
Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be used and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
appropriate asset class. At 31 December 2024, assets under construction relate to deposits for packhouse equipment and building upgrades.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on at least a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by CBRE Group Inc.,
independent registered valuer. At 31 December 2024, 38% (Dec 2023 - 52%) of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was externally
revalued in line with policy. The remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause a movement in land and buildings of between
1.34% and 8.92% (Dec 2023 - 0.82% and 3.79%). This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.
In Australia, valuations were completed at 31 December 2024 by Opteon (Goulburn North East Vic) Pty Limited, independent valuers based in
Victoria, Australia.
The valuers consider three different approaches in concert to arrive at a fair value;
1. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.
2. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the property with a current market rental being established and capitalising this at an
appropriate rate of return that would be expected by a prudent investor. The 2024 year saw capitalisation rates move between 0.50% - 1.00%
since the previous valuations of the same properties, some of which may have been up to three years prior.
3. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the investment method
and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market rentals and estimated costs incurred
to maintain land and buildings in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are sold in the terminal year (year 11).

Significant unobservable inputs inherent in the land and building valuation process include potential market comparative rentals, and the market
rental capitalisation rates. The higher the rental rate, the higher the fair value, and the higher the capitalisation rate, the lower the fair value.
Significant changes in either of these inputs would result in significant changes to the fair value measurement. See below;
1. Market rental rates - Packhouse rental rates as described in the valuation reports obtained in 2024 between $50/m2 - $125/m2 (Dec 2023 - $55/
m2 - $130/m2). Coolstore rental rates were between $0.38/tray - $0.68/tray (Dec 2023 - $0.40/tray - $0.63/tray).
2. Rental capitalisation rates - Capitalistion rates as described in the valuation reports obtained in 2024 were between 7.00% – 9.50% (Dec 2023 8.25% - 9.50%).
3. Discount rates – Discount rates as described in the valuation rates obtained in 2024 were between 7.60% - 10.77% (Dec 2023 – 9.23% - 10.37%).
The net book value of land is $50.23m (Dec 2023 - $47.24m) and buildings is $230.15m (Dec 2023 - $223.61m), see note 28.
The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax, of $2.71m (Dec 2023 - $7.47m).

As a consequence of the building revaluations conducted December 2024, $2.61m (Dec 2023 - $9.08m) of accumulated depreciation was offset
directly against the assets' cost or valuation, prior to revaluation.
In the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group assessed the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and did not identify any material
situations where the useful life of an asset or group of assets was not appropriate or within the existing accounting policy.

Impairment of bearer plants
For the year ended 31 December 2024 no assets were impaired (Dec 2023 - $0.95m). The 2023 impairment was for bearer plants in Australia
that were removed.
Impairment of land, buildings, plant and equipment
For the year ended 31 December 2024 $0.30m (Dec 2023 - $0.53m) of assets were impaired.
The 2024 impairments were for wind-damaged hail netting in Australia which has been removed while other risk management solutions are
identified, and orchard equipment in New Zealand which has been removed as part of planned machinery replacement.

Accounting policies
Bearer plants
Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear, jujube, avocado and other fruiting vines and trees on Group-owned and leased land. Bearer
plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase or establish the asset.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any subsequent
improvements at cost, less depreciation. At each annual balance date, no less than one third of assets classified as land and buildings are revalued
and those valuations are used to assess the appropriateness of the carrying values of all land and building assets held by the Group, which effectively
revalue all land and buildings annually. Revaluations are performed more frequently if changing industry conditions may cause their carrying value
to differ significantly from fair value. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the
asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and buildings are accounted for through comprehensive income and other reserves,
except where an asset's assessed fair value is less than the original cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Property, plant and equipment
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase the
asset.
Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs
and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Asset impairments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.
7 - 50 years

– Machinery

5 - 30 years

– Vehicles

4 - 15 years

5 - 15 years

– Bearer plants

4 - 25 years

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted
if appropriate, at balance date and an asset’s carrying amount is
immediately written down to its recoverable amount.

The estimated useful lives of assets from revaluation date are:
– Buildings and fit outs

– Furniture, fittings and equipment

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is included in the
statement of profit or loss. When revalued assets are sold, the
amounts included in the revaluation reserve in respect of those assets
are transferred to retained earnings.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 31 December 2024, 38% (Dec 2023 - 52%) of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was externally revalued in line with policy.
Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause a movement in land and buildings of between
1.34% and 8.92%. This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

Water shares
The Group remeasured the value of water shares to historical cost as at 1 January 2023.
Water shares are an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual crops in Australia and are
carried at historical cost. Such rights have an indefinite life and are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment. If events or changes in
circumstances indicate impairment, the carrying value is adjusted to take account of any impairment losses.
The Group’s portfolio of water rights is currently recorded at a historical cost value of $3.1m (Dec 2023 - $3.0m). A market value assessment was
performed at the end of the financial year. This was completed by accessing the Victorian Water Register and determining the weighted average
sales price for the applicable class of water rights. This value is then applied on a like for like basis to the Group’s water portfolio. As water prices
fluctuate due to seasonal factors, current market rates have been valued internally for impairment testing purposes at $5.1m (Dec 2023 - $5.9m).
Impairment tests for goodwill
At 31 December 2024 Seeka's market capitalisation was less than net assets which is an indicator of impairment. In response the Group has
performed impairment tests on all cash generating units (CGUs), in addition to CGUs with goodwill balances to ensure that future cash flows of
the CGUs and the Group support the fair value of the assets.
Goodwill balances are assessed annually for impairment. The impairment tests were performed using a value in use calculation model.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value-in-use), with a terminal value
beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated in this note.
The assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margins for the cash generating units are determined based on
forecast crop volumes, past financial performance and the Board's expectation of future market dynamics, plus the Group's current year forecasts
and five year financial plans.
The goodwill and asset value allocated to the post-harvest CGU is supported by historical profitability, increasing volume forecasts, and forecast
growth of the kiwifruit industry and returns.
Any financial impact of climate change is expected to fall outside of the planning period given the long-term nature of climate change. However,
scenario planning is being carried out across the Group to prepare for the impact of climate change on future yields, varieties, and growing
methods. Seeka has a long history of adapting to the environment, such as when Psa arrived in New Zealand and the industry pivoted to the
SunGold variety, alongside past climatic events such as droughts, hail, and floods. Climate change risks may result in unforeseen events, which
may have possible implications that cannot be estimated with certainty. The business will continue to adapt to the changing environment.
No impairment was noted in the CGUs as a result of the impairment test, either on the CGUs with or without goodwill allocated to them.
The annual impairment tests of goodwill were performed at 30 November 2024. Impairment indicators were considered at 31 December 2024,
however no indicators were identified that required any further impairment testing.
Additions to goodwill
There were no additions to goodwill in 2024 (Dec 2023 - Nil).
Cash generating units (CGUs)
All goodwill at 31 December 2024 is allocated to the post-harvest CGU. The post-harvest CGU reflects the operationally coordinated and
financially interdependent nature of post-harvest operations across the regions serviced by Seeka. To best handle fruit at optimum maturity, and
maximise post-harvest efficiency and flexibility, the regions are managed as one unit with mature fruit allocated to the next available facility. This

1. The discount rate is calculated based on the specific circumstances of the cash generating unit and its operations, and is derived from its
weighted average cost of capital.
2. The long term growth rate is based on the long term expected inflation rate, being within the RBNZ inflationary target of 1%-3%. The Group has
set its terminal growth rates at 2% to ensure a long term conservative growth estimate has been applied in the impairment tests.
3. EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations.

Post-harvest CGU
The goodwill relating to the post-harvest CGU is supported by historical profitability, with a positive outlook and significant growth path ahead.
Following several difficult seasons, 2024 had a rebound of volumes and exceptional returns culminating in record profits for the post-harvest
CGU and the Group as a whole. The forecast cash flows for 2025 and onwards assume a return to average yields, a return to normal growing
conditions, and a stable sales market, which translates into consistent and steadily increasing returns to the CGU.
The impairment and recoverable amount of the CGU were calculated using the value-in-use method.
No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an impairment of goodwill.

Accounting policies
Intangible assets

Water shares

Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and
amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation
and are tested at least annually for impairment, with impairment losses
recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
When assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable
unit able to generate cash flow.

The Group records permanent water shares at historical cost. Such
rights have an indefinite life and are not amortised but are tested
annually for impairment. If events or changes in circumstances
indicate impairment, the carrying value is adjusted to take account of
any impairment losses.

Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Internally developed computer software is capitalised when it enters
the development phase and includes costs incurred to develop and
test the software for use. Intangible assets are amortised over their
estimated useful life (typically four to five years).
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill on a business acquisition is included
in intangible assets, and on acquisition of an associate is included in
investments in associates. When acquired in business combinations,
the goodwill is annually tested for impairment (or more frequently if
there are impairment indicators) and carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to that business.

Other intangibles
The Group records permanent water shares at historical cost. Such
rights have an indefinite life and are not amortised but are tested
annually for impairment. If events or changes in circumstances
indicate impairment, the carrying value is adjusted to take account of
any impairment losses.
Impairment of assets
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are
not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment,
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that they might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher
of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups
of assets (cash-generating units (CGUs)). Non-financial assets other
than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible
reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The intangible assets impairment tests require judgement to determine the appropriate forecast cash flows and inputs into the calculations. The
primary estimates relate to the forecast EBITDA growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates.

12. Biological assets - crop
Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears and other crops growing on leased and owned orchards and yet to be
harvested at balance date.
The following table reconciles beginning balances to end balances for biological assets crop measured at fair value defined as level 3 in note 28.

Crop where fair value cannot be measured reliably
Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date therefore
fair value is not able to be measured reliably and, as such, these crops are measured initially at cost less impairment.
Crop valued at fair value
Where a crop has achieved sufficient biological transformation, it is measured at fair value less costs to sell using unobservable inputs in the fair
value assessment. These unobservable inputs include forecasted sales prices achieved once the crop is harvested and marketed for sale, if the
forecast price was to increase so would the fair value of the crop.

Accounting policies
The Group's biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group's leased and owned orchards. All crops have a maturity period of
less than one year and will be harvested within 12 months from the Group's balance date.
Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell provided this can be measured reliably, otherwise they are measured at cost.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred fair value is not able to be measured reliably. Biological assets at cost are not depreciated as
they are in the process of maturing.
Fair value is determined as the estimated net market return.

13. Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities
The Group reports all leases on the balance sheet where it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset
throughout the period of the lease, with the exception of low value leases or leases less than 12 months.
The following table details leases where the Group is a lessee.

Additions and renewals

Additions
During the period ended 31 December 2024, the Group renewed $1.11m (Dec 2023: $1.77m) of leases relating to post-harvest coolstorage
facilities, $0.30m (Dec 2023: $0.55m) of leases relating to retail service facilities, and $4.92m (Dec 2023: $2.31m) of leases relating to vehicles
and equipment leases.			

Accounting policies
Lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, including any renewal periods that are likely to be exercised,
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate which ranges between 7.57% and 16.50%. The discount rate is based on the Group's
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate the Group would borrow the funds required to purchase the asset. When determining the discount rate,
Seeka considers that the value of the right-of-use lease asset should not be greater than the fair value of the underlying asset being leased.
The Group’s right-of-use lease asset is equal to the lease liability on the day of lease inception, with the exception of sale and leaseback
transactions where the asset is measured as the proportion of the carrying value of the asset sold of which the benefit is retained by the Group.
The right-of-use lease asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Costs incurred with a lease that are not part of the
cost of the right-of-use lease asset are expensed.
All leases have been classified into one of the following asset classes:
– Land and building - leases for rental of all properties, including packhouses and coolstores
– Orchard - leases held for the development of productive orchards
– Equipment - leases for equipment, including plant equipment and forklifts
– Motor vehicles - leases for motor vehicles
The Group leases various properties for the packing and cooling of kiwifruit, leases orchards to grow kiwifruit and avocados, and leases equipment
and vehicles. The terms of the leases vary, with land and building leases ranging from 10 - 15 years, with one 99 year lease. Orchard leases range
from 3 - 25 years, and equipment and vehicle leases range from 1 - 5 years.
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. In the case of orchard leases, only the fixed rental is recognised as a lease liability.
Any variable consideration relating to profit share on the orchard leases is not accounted for as the profit share is only determined after a crop has
been harvested and is not identifiable at the commencement of the lease. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a range
of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interest in the leased assets that are
held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
The Group is exposed to potential future increases in land and building lease payments based on contractual market rent reviews that are not
included in the lease liability until the rent review takes place.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and lease interest. The lease interest is charged to the statement of profit and loss over the term
of the lease.

Prepaid deposits includes $0.25m for avocado trees and kiwifruit vines not yet received (Dec 2023 - $0.25m).
Accrued income and other sundry receivables includes income to be received from orcharding operations on 440 hectares of leased and owned
orchards (Dec 2023 - 382 hectares).
A $0.76m provision for doubtful debts is recognised in the accounts (Dec 2023 - $0.26m).
Non-current trade receivables includes $0.83m losses carried forward on Hayward short term leased orchards to be recovered in a future period
(Dec 2023 - $1.81m). Non current receivables also include $2.74m (Dec 2023 - $1.56m) of long term receivable balances with agreed longterm payment terms. The remaining balance of non-current trade receivables relates to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with
repayment terms of up to five years and is considered recoverable.

Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 27 for calculation details.

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the
freehold land and buildings, and a General Security Agreement over all
the assets of the following trading entities within the Group, as either
borrowers or guarantors. These entities make up the bank Charging
Group.
The value of the Group’s assets that are not part of the Charging Group is
$11.02m, being less than 2.01% of the total Group assets.
The Charging Group comprises the following entities:
Borrowers and guarantors:
– Seeka Limited
– Seeka Australia (Pty) Limited

Guarantors:
– Aongatete Coolstores Limited
– Delicious Nutritious Food Company Limited
– Kiwi Coast Growers (Te Puke) Limited
– Northland Horticulture Limited
– OPAC Properties Limited
– Seeka East Limited
– Seeka OPAC Limited
– Seeka Te Puke Limited

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Share-based incentive schemes
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive schemes:
– A compensation scheme for employees; 623,000 shares were issued under this scheme on 6 May 2024.
– A grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders 18 April 2024; 898,659 shares were issued under this scheme on 20 May 2024.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust
deed established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
Grower loyalty share scheme
On 19 April 2024, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit, avocado and Kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share scheme,
whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares based on the greater of their orchard's class 1 production from harvest 2023 (harvest
2023/24 for avocado), or potential production using baseline yields by product. Shareholders approved a resolution to issue up to 2.4m shares, and fund
the issue price through a loan, at the 18 April 2024 annual shareholders meeting.
On 20 May 2024, 898,659 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 203 growers. The issue price of $2.5444 per share was funded
by the Group making a $2.29m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying all product from the
participating orchards for three consecutive seasons, the shares will vest and participating growers can elect to pay the outstanding balance of their
loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them. The supply commitment period for kiwifruit and
kiwiberry growers ends 30 June 2026, and for avocado growers 31 March 2027.
Employee share scheme
On 19 April 2024, the Group invited eligible employees to participate in a three-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would be
allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business.
On 6 May 2024, 623,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 346 participating employees. The issue price of $2.8679 per
share was funded by the Group making a $1.79m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing
employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can elect to pay the outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend payments
made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them. Shares issued under this scheme vest in 2027.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit / (loss) attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued and outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

The foreign currency revaluation reserve records unrealised gains and losses on Group assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies.
The share entitlement reserve records the value of option benefits recognised on the Group's grower loyalty and employee share schemes as
detailed in this note.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares were issued to a share trust in return for a debt owed back to the Company. Scheme shares vest in 2027.
At the end of the vesting period, eligible employees have the option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred
to them, see note 18. The option benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period.

Accounting policies
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss with
a corresponding increase in the share entitlement reserve. For the Grower Loyalty Share Scheme (GLSS), the fair value of the grower loyalty received
in exchange for the grant of the option is recognised as a discount against other income in the statement of profit or loss with a corresponding
increase in share entitlement reserve. The fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, calculated using the Black
Scholes pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those shares is transferred to retained earnings.
Employee share scheme shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average Price
(VWAP) calculation of the Company's shares during the period prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with further
shares if that issue would result in the ESS having an interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.
Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the debt
between ESS and GLSS and the Group on behalf of the employee or the grower.
Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited to share capital when payment for the shares is received.
The ESS and GLSS have a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated to employees and growers. Annually the Group reviews the ESS scheme
and decides upon the allocation of further shares and the price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS and GLSS are
appointed for an unspecified term and may be removed by the Company at any time.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The initial fair values of the employee share scheme and grower loyalty share scheme require estimates to be made of expected price volatility and
the risk free rate as detailed in this note.

Seeka dividend policy
Seeka’s dividend policy during the year was to declare and distribute dividends between 65% and 75% of Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) annually in
conjunction with the release of the half year and full year results subject to due consideration of the Board.
On 26 February 2025, Seeka updated its dividend policy to declare and distribute dividends between 50% and 75% of underlying Net Profit After
Tax (NPAT), normally to be paid in October and April, subject to due consideration of the Board.

Financial contents

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the voting rights in the
entity or exercising significant influence via directors on the Board.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost and tested annually for impairment.
The Group's share of associates profits or losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and the carrying amount of the investment in the
statement of financial position.
Dividends or distributions received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

The Apanui Road Joint Venture is considered a joint operation based on the following:
– There is equal voting rights and influence;
– There is no investment vehicle that separates the entities from the parties to the arrangement; and,
– The legal form and contractual arrangements through which the investee operates give the parties rights to the individual assets and liabilities
of the investee (rather than the net assets as a whole).
The orchards of Apanui Road Orchards Joint Venture have a finite life, are carried at their fair value and are included in the consolidated financial
statements.

Accounting policies
Investment in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and
obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
Joint operations
The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings.
Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the statement of financial position.

by NZ RegCo, New Zealand's listed market regulator. The waiver
allows Seeka to enter into post-harvest agreements with persons
associated with Seeka directors (being, related party growers) without
having to obtain shareholder approval in accordance with Rule 5.2.1.
Rule 5.2.1 provides shareholders with the opportunity to review
transactions where the Board may have been subject to an actual or
perceived influence by a related party.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

In granting the waiver, NZ RegCo considered that Seeka's related
parties and their associated directors will not exercise undue influence
to achieve a favourable outcome from entering into Seeka postharvest agreements, as the agreements are prepared by management,
standardised, and offered to all growers, including related party
growers, on the same terms.
Directors Peter Ratahi Cross and Stewart Moss are associated with
related party growers that entered into post-harvest agreements with
Seeka during the year ended 31 December 2024 for the supply of
post-harvest services by Seeka. All related party transactions were
made on normal commercial terms and conditions and at market
rates. The terms of the post-harvest agreements for the year ended 31
December 2024 were entered into and negotiated on a commercial
basis, following the process set out in the waiver. The aggregate gross
revenue received by Seeka for the year ended 31 December 2024
related to these transactions with related party growers was $10.9m.
See Summary of waivers granted by NZX on page 91 for further
details.
Grower loyalty and employee share schemes
During the year, 56,000 shares were issued to Seeka Share Trustee
Limited, where the beneficial owners are key management personnel,
in accordance with the employee share scheme.
Additionally, during the year 78,846 shares were issued to Seeka
Share Trustee Limited, where the beneficial owners are key
management personnel, in accordance with the grower loyalty share
scheme.
See note 18 on page 50 and note 20 on page 52 for information
on the share schemes.
Terms and conditions
All related party transactions were made on normal commercial
terms and conditions and at market rates. Outstanding balances are
unsecured and are repayable in cash.

27. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to producing
and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate financial risks related
to credit, liquidity, foreign currency and capital risk. The Group operates
a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation programme through its
Audit and Risk Committee.

– Fire risk is typically from serious grass wild-fire occurring during
periods of extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority
responsible for risk assessment and management of fire events.
The Group takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk
including removing excess vegetation from Group properties.

The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value and
maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders,
as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources are available for the
development of the Group’s business whilst managing its financial risks.

All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest
incursions. The kiwifruit vine disease Pseudomonas syringae
pv. actinidiae (Psa) is widespread throughout New Zealand and
Australia, and is being actively managed. Seeka has moved to contain
the outbreak and works to proactively monitor the orchards. The
Queensland fruit fly and brown marmorated stink bug are potential
threats to the horticulture industry. To minimise the risk of crop loss
the Group monitors its orchards and undertakes recognised spray
programmes to protect crops to the fullest extent possible. Seeka also
relies on the Ministry for Primary Industries to protect New Zealand's
borders from introduced diseases.

a. Risk management strategies related to orcharding,
post-harvest and retail operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production and
market returns. The main short-term production risks are weather
events, diseases, and pests. These impact on volume and quality of
produce from the Group's orchards, volumes to post-harvest (both
from Group orchard operations and independent growers) and
volumes available to the retail business.
Market risks include price and exchange rate impact on orchard
operations (the amount the Group is paid for crops grown by the
Group) and impact on retail revenues where the Group imports and
sells produce, mainly bananas. The exchange rate risk on imports is
managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts to match
known and planned purchases. Market risks do not directly impact on
post-harvest operations, as charges are normally set prior to harvest
and deducted before sales revenues are paid to supplying growers.
The Group operates in five regions spread over two countries; New
Zealand's Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne and the Bay of Plenty
regions, and in Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce
lines are kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears, avocado and Kiwiberry,
with small production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail
activities are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce),
Australia, Asia, Europe and the USA. The Group's geographical,
product and market spread limits the impact on Group operations from
an adverse event occurring in a specific region, produce or market. To
further mitigate risks, the Board uses the following strategies.
Production risks - weather events, disease and pests
The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production risks.
This includes orchard management practices to optimise production from
Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure post-harvest and retail
services are suitably resourced to manage each season's crop volumes.
In New Zealand the major climatic risks are hail, frost, storm damage and
drought.
– Hail events are typically highly localised, and for kiwifruit the Group has
access to industry hail insurance for its orchard operations, plus top-up
payments from a Seeka Growers Limited hail insurance programme.
– Frost events are typically regional, and the Group advocates bestpractice crop protection, including active frost management on kiwifruit
orchards operated by the Group and other growers supplying the
Group's post-harvest operations.
– Storm events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including shelter belts on all orchards
operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's postharvest operations.
– Drought events are typically regional, and the Group has invested
in irrigation in many of its orchards. The Group is also investing in
localised weather measurement on its orchards.
In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As the
owner or manager of all orchards supplying its Australian operations,
the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total production base.
The orchards are located on three sites in the Mundoona region.
– Drought events are typically regional, and to secure adequate
irrigation, the Group has purchased long-term water shares from a
reliable irrigation programme.

Climate change
As a horticultural based business, Seeka is exposed to the long-term
impact of climate change through potential reduced production crop
yields. In addition to responding to weather events, future regulatory
change may impact Seeka through revised policies that limit the use
of chemical inputs on orchards, require soil monitoring and reporting,
introduce carbon taxes, and implement water restrictions.
To respond to this Seeka;
– Has a Board Sustainability Committee to assist in governance;
– Is measuring its carbon footprint, has set reduction targets, and
implemented carbon-reduction initiatives;
– Is actively engaged in developing orchard management practices to
measure the environmental impact on orchards; and
– Ensures new developments undertaken by Seeka include water
accessibility as part of the development design, whether via stream
access, onsite storage, or developing wetlands.
Market returns
New Zealand kiwifruit
The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit
harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing activities
beyond Australia are undertaken by Zespri Group Limited (Zespri)
under statutory regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the
level of Zespri's market returns which impact on the Group's orchard
profitability. The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling
techniques to analyse current and projected orchard income. This
information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease
terms.
New Zealand avocado and Kiwiberry
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocado and
Kiwiberry, with half of Kiwiberry sales and all avocado sales managed
by the Group's retail operations. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns. This information is used when
setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.
The Group has no direct currency risk from export sales as it does not
own the products but acts as the growers’ agent.
Imported tropical produce
The Group has direct market, price and currency risk from imported
fruit produce (banana, pineapple and papaya) where the Group
imports fruit produce for sale as the principal through its supply
and sale contracts. The Group may hedge up to the total known and
projected cash flows to manage exchange risk. The Group has no
material direct price and currency risk from imported fruit produce
where the supply agreement enables the Group to amend its purchase
price according to trading conditions.

– Hail events are typically localised, and the Australian orchards are
geographically spread to reduce risk of total loss.

Main contents
Financial contents

Australian produce
The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian operations. As
one of the largest growers and suppliers of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong relationships with key retailers.
The Group forecasts seasonal supply, monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around the needs of key retailers and controls
product quality and supply to optimise market access and returns.
Seeka Australia is the Group’s single international operation, exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk includes future
commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed through borrowings in Australian
dollars, see note 17.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including
outstanding receivables, derivative financial instruments and committed transactions.
The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The Group's maximum exposure is
the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the statement of financial position.
For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require any collateral or
security to support financial instruments due to the quality of the financial institutions.
For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post-harvest services
directly from Seeka Growers Limited through its contractual agreement to deduct from Zespri receipts received by Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is
therefore not considered significant.
Trade receivables
The Group applies the NZ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (NZ IFRS 9) simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Management factors in forward-looking information, including future crop and return forecasts,
and the macro economic environment when assessing the recoverability of trade receivables. Many outstanding receivables relate to debtors where
balances are secured by future crop returns. No adjustments were made to the assessment as a result of these factors.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment
profiles of sales over a 12 month period before 31 December 2024 and the corresponding historical credit losses during this period, adjusted for any
significant known amounts that are not recoverable. Management identifies any non-recoverable debts through regular conversations with debtors.
On that basis, the following table details the provision for doubtful debts.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure
that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity
requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.
When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.
At balance date, the Group had $201.36m (Dec 2023 - $200.79m) of available credit of which $140.29m (Dec 2023 - $177.58m) was drawn. All
credit lines are currently provided by a bank syndicate comprised of five lenders across New Zealand and Australia, where Westpac New Zealand
Limited acts as the syndicate agent lender, security trustee and lead lender.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios, net leverage ratios,
and earnings times interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants. The Group, however, obtained
agreement from its banking syndicate in June 2023 to modify two of it covenants (net leverage and interest cover) to 31 December 2024.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position as
investment in financial assets. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities, only some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity
reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through comprehensive income whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance is
available. When no such reserve exists, any related loss is processed directly in the statement of profit or loss, otherwise available reserves are
utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.

28. Determination of fair values of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities
The different levels are defined as:

– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement
date.

– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to
be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant
would use when determining an appropriate price.

Accounting policies
Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes. Fair value
measurements are categorised into a three-level hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation techniques used.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and investment in shares) is based
on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid
price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using
valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses the appropriate method and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions at
each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Other techniques, such as estimated
discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to
their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with unobservable inputs (level 3), reflects the assumptions that market
participants would use when determining an appropriate price; additional disclosure is provided for the inputs and assumptions used in such
cases.
Land and buildings
Fair value is based on an annual revaluation, which is performed on land and buildings based on at least a rolling three-year cycle by an
independent valuer, with a minimum of one third of land and buildings assets valued each year using three different approaches as described in
note 10.

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship and through annual prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure
that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates,
maturities and notional amount. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts where purchases or receipts are expected to be settled in that
foreign currency. The Group does not hedge 100% of its loans or foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:
– the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan,
– differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans, or,
– trading ceases to exist in the foreign currency.
There was no material ineffectiveness during 2024 or 2023 in relation to the interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts.

Accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value
at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and
effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the relationship
between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is
used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is
ultimately recognised in the statement of profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss
that was reported in comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the statement of profit or loss within other gains / (losses).
Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market. Valuation
techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are based on quoted market
rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by Westpac New Zealand Limited.

Accounting policies
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories in accordance with NZ IFRS 9:
– amortised cost for financial assets and liabilities,
– assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI),
– assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL),
– liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and
– other financial liabilities.
The classification of financial assets and liabilities under NZ IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which the financial instrument is
managed and its contractual cash flows characteristics.
On initial recognition, a financial instrument is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL.
Financial instruments are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model in which case all
affected financial instruments are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.
A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL:
– it is held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows; and
– its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the
investment’s fair value in other comprehensive income. The election is made on an investment by investment basis.
All financial instruments not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.

Independent Auditor’s Report

Grant Thornton New Zealand Audit Limited
L4, Grant Thornton House
152 Fanshawe Street
PO Box 1961
Auckland 1140
T +64 (0)9 308 2570
www.grantthornton.co.nz

To the Shareholders of Seeka Limited
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company), including its subsidiaries (the Group) on pages 22
to 67 which comprise the Group’s statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024, and the statement of
comprehensive income, statement of profit or loss, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group
as at 31 December 2024 and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New
Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) issued by the New Zealand Accounting
Standards Board and IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs (NZ)) issued by the New
Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in
accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including
International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board
and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
(including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Our firm carries out other assignments for the Group in the area of agreed upon procedures in respect to the debt covenant
compliance certificate and interim financial statements. The provision of these services have not impaired our independence
as auditor of the Group. Subject to certain restrictions, partners and employees of our firm may also deal with the Group on
normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. This matter has not impaired our
independence as auditor of the Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Grant Thornton New Zealand Audit Limited is a related entity of Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited. ‘Grant Thornton’ refers to the brand under which the Grant Thornton member firms provide
services to their clients and/or refers to one or more member firms as the context requires. Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited is a member firm of Grant Thornton International Ltd (GTIL). GTIL and

Key audit matters

Our procedures to address the key audit matter

Goodwill Impairment assessment

The procedures we performed to evaluate the impairment
assessments included:

As disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements,
the carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill
amounting to $20.2 million, is included within one
cash generating unit (CGU) as at 31 December 2024.
In addition to the above, the market capitalisation as
at 31 December 2024 was lower than the carrying
amount of the Group’s net assets. This is an indicator
of impairment and required additional analysis and
interpretation.
The impairment assessment is a key audit matter due
to significant level of judgement involved in
determining the methodology and assumptions used
in the testing.
To determine whether the carrying value of goodwill,
and the carrying values of all other CGUs is
reasonable, management performed an impairment
assessment on a value-in-use (VIU) basis.
Impairment tests prepared by management were
based on discounted cashflow models using Board
approved budgets for the year ending 31 December
2025 and combined with forecasted cashflows for
subsequent years. The Board approved budgets have
been allocated to the CGUs to meet the requirements
of NZ IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The key assumptions in assessing the CGUs carrying
value were as follows:
-

-

assessed whether the methodology adopted was
consistent with accepted valuation approaches under NZ
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets;

-

evaluated the Group’s determination of CGUs and
whether they were appropriate. This included reviewing
internal management reporting to assess the level at
which the Group monitors performance, comparing CGUs
to our knowledge of the Group’s operations and reporting
systems, and reconciling assets allocated to CGUs to
accounting records;

-

obtained management’s impairment assessments and
tested the mathematical accuracy of the VIU calculations;

-

challenged management’s assumptions and estimates
used to determine the recoverable value of its CGUs,
including but not limited to those relating to forecasted
revenue, expenditure and discount rates applied;

-

compared forecasted cashflows used for the year ending
31 December 2025 to the Board approved budget and
five-year plan;

-

assessed the Group’s forecasting accuracy by
comparing historical forecasts to actual results;

-

engaged our own internal valuation experts to assess
the valuation methodology’s compliance with NZ IAS
36, and the appropriateness of the pre-tax discount
rates and terminal growth rates, based on their
experience and external evidences;

-

assessed whether there were any material movements in
assumptions between 30 November 2024 test date and
31 December 2024 balance date; and

-

we audited the disclosures in the financial statements to
ensure they are compliant with the requirements of the
relevant accounting standards.

The terminal value growth rate; and
The pre-tax discount rate

Refer to note 11 in the financial statements for
disclosures on the key assumptions and impairment
assessments of the carrying value of the CGUs.

Valuation of land and buildings
As disclosed in note 10 of the financial statements,
the Group has a policy of revaluing its land and
buildings on at least a three-year rolling cycle
(excluding assets under construction), with
approximately one-third of the properties revalued at
each balance date by an independent external valuer
using three different methods to arrive at a fair value.
For properties not subject to external valuations, the
Group assesses whether asset values remain
appropriate and materially reflect fair value,
considering the results of third-party valuations and
other recent market data. The inclusion of land and
buildings' valuation as a key audit matter arises from
the substantial judgment involved in the valuations.
As at 31 December 2024, 38% of the portfolio value
was externally revalued.

Our procedures, amongst others, included:
-

obtained and agreed the schedule of revalued property to
the respective independent valuation reports, performed
by valuation experts;

-

evaluated the qualifications and work of management’s
external valuation experts;

-

engaged with our own external valuation specialist to
scrutinize the efforts of third-party valuers and evaluate
the validity of assumptions made, including the valuation
approaches and methods adopted;

-

Reviewed and challenged management’s assessment of
carrying values of the land and buildings not subject to
external valuations by comparing our own assessment of
valuation ranges using our external valuation expert;

-

confirmed each property valuation is performed in
accordance with the valuation standards that are accepted
as suitable by accounting standards for use in determining
the carrying value as at 31 December 2024;

-

recalculated the revaluation adjustment to be recorded for
the year of each revalued property as at 31 December
2024; and

-

we audited the disclosures in the financial statements to
ensure they are compliant with the requirements of the
relevant accounting standards.

The total value of the Group’s land and buildings as at
31 December 2024 is $281.4 million.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 2024 Overview, Financial Review,
Greenhouse Gas Reporting, Governance and Directory, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report
thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of audit opinion
or assurance conclusion thereon.
In connections with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Directors’ responsibilities for the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but
to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.
A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the External
Reporting Board’s website at: https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards/assurance-standards/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/
Restriction on use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s shareholders, as a body those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the Company and its shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report or for the opinion we have formed.

Corporate governance statement
As at 31 December 2024
At Seeka we conduct our business safely and ethically within the legal and regulatory framework so we can deliver the best outcomes for our growers,
clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.
Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the recommendations in the NZX Corporate
Governance Code, 31 January 2025 (the Code). Our practices are set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews
Seeka's corporate governance structures against the eight principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures
substantially meet Code recommendations. Any exceptions are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 85 of this annual report.
Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.
The Board approved this governance statement on 27 February 2025.

Principle 1. Ethical Standards
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
followed throughout the organisation.”
Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory, and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.
Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”
Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are
promoted, with Seeka's Board reinforcing the company's expectations that employees will follow the highest standards of ethical behaviour. The code
outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and model high ethical standards to all employees and
stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”
The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:
• Conflicts of interest
• Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property
• Conduct, valuing individuals' differences and respecting all stakeholders
• Dealing with gifts or gratuities
• Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing
• Compliance with laws and Seeka policies
• Managing breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics
Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy that applies to the Seeka team of directors, officers, senior managers and all employees, that prohibits
team members from direct or indirect dealing in Seeka financial products when holding inside information, plus a duty of confidentiality that protects
the dissemination and use of confidential company information.
The Insider Trading Policy defines black-out periods during which restricted persons (defined below) are prohibited from trading in Seeka shares
unless provided with a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to, and finishes the first trading day after, key
events; being the half-year and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares.
Restricted persons includes all directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts
and companies controlled by such persons, and advisors. The policy also specifies that Seeka team members should not engage in short-term trading.
Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chair of the Board, and the chair must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.
No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.

Principle 2. Board Composition and Performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”
Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interests of the company, to deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board Charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the duties
and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:
• Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards that fully comply with relevant legislation
• Compliance with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) and NZX Listing Rules

ANNUAL REPORT 2024 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Governance

• Meeting obligations under environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles
• Establishing key corporate objectives and strategies
• Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies
• Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance
• Ensuring the Group uses adequate risk-management strategies
• Issuing clear written delegation to the chief executive officer including detailing their responsibilities
• Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication
The Board follows NZX corporate governance rules, including the directors' fiduciary duties to act in the Group's best interests, to exercise due skill
and care, and to comply with the Board charter and Group policies, procedures and codes, including ethics, insider trading and disclosures of trading
in Group shares. As required, directors are able to seek independent advice to aid decision making and have access to the external auditors without
management present.
The Board delegates to the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.

Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth
to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings for Board succession planning. This occurred on 1 December 2024 with the appointment
of independent director Mark Dewdney. On 31 December 2024, independent director Ashley Waugh resigned, with independent director Hayley
Gourley appointed on 1 January 2025. At the 16 April 2025 Annual Shareholders Meeting, independent Chair Fred Hutchings will retire, having served
12 years on the Board.
Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at
least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between governance and management, all directors are non-executive
and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.
Seeka’s Board is led by the independent chair Fred Hutchings, and for the full year the Board has had a majority of independent directors. The

Governance

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually. The determination of each director's independence can be found at
www.seeka.co.nz/board-of-directors-investors/.
As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors that served
on the Board in 2024 are experienced in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka were
considered non-independent directors;
• Hayden Cartwright
• Ratahi Cross; also an appointee of large Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited.
• Stewart Moss
During the year the Board had five independent directors. Director independence is defined as not having an interest, position or relationship that
could impact decision making;
• Fred Hutchings, Board chair
• Sharon Cresswell
• Mark Dewdney (appointed 1 December 2024)
• Cecilia Tarrant, and
• Ashley Waugh (resigned 31 December 2024)
On 31 December 2024, independent director Ashley Waugh resigned, with independent director Hayley Gourley appointed 1 January 2025.
Whilst Fred Hutchings has an interest in a small kiwifruit orchard, it is not considered a material business relationship that would impact his
independence.

Director appointments and induction
As required, the chair establishes a Nominations Committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.
Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the Group’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the Board.
The chair undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the Nominations
Committee and external advisors.

While there is no maximum term, the Board annually reviews director length of service and any potential impact on director independence. When
the Board recommends the re-election of a director whom has served longer than 12 years, it will explain to shareholders its rationale for supporting
re-election.

Director profiles
Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 86 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 88 of this annual report.

Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.
The Board works to optimise diversity across directors, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity in gender, culture
and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key clients, creating
unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns. Notably, Ratahi Cross of Ngāi Tukairangi is a lecturer in Māori history.

Independent directors

The Board considers the composition of its independent directors a relevant measure of Board diversity. In FY24, following a director appointment as
part of Board succession planning, the number of independent directors that identify as female decreased to 40% (FY23: 50%), with the percentage
of all directors and senior managers that identify as female decreasing to 27% (FY23: 29%). At 1 January 2025, following a director resignation on 31
December 2024, and new director appointment on 1 January 2025, the number of independent directors that identify as female increased to 60%,
with the percentage of all directors and senior managers that identify as female increasing to 33%.

Diversity policy
Seeka is committed to providing an inclusive environment that supports a diversity of thinking and skills. Aspects of diversity include gender, ethnic
background, religion, marital status, culture, disability, economic background, education, language, physical appearance and sexual orientation.
Seeka's Diversity Policy promotes equal employment opportunities, and while it does not set measurable objectives, the Group has a very large
workforce drawing on local communities, as well as people from the Pacific and Asia through the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) scheme.
During the year ended 31 December 2024, Seeka performed in adherence to the principles of its Diversity Policy.

Professional development
Directors are supported to undertake professional development through individual training and by attending relevant courses.

Evaluation of board, committee and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chair undertakes an annual review of Board, committee and director performance. The chair's 2024 review found that
the Board, committees and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified by the Board Charter.

Principle 3. Board Committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”
The Board has three permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance functions, while
retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.
All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the Audit and Risk, Sustainability, Remuneration, and Nominations Committee Charters biennially.

Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board, except during succession planning when an eighth director may be appointed until the
next annual shareholders meeting, at which point the Board reverts to seven directors. To provide effective and transparent committee governance,
while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent director, with
committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors to provide the best skill set. The Audit and Risk Committee
Charter specifies a majority of independent directors.
The current standing committees and their members are:

minimum of two member directors at each committee meeting.

Principle 4. Reporting and Disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”
Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a midyear performance update, along with regular operational updates to growers.
Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chair of the Board, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for
identifying material information between Board meetings. At every Board meeting the Board considers whether there is relevant material information
which should be disclosed to the market.
As stewards of around 4500 hectares of orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and
international guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P
standard for good agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food.
See www.globalgap.org.
Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/what-we-offer/solutions/grasp/.
In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit returns;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.
Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual financial statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides
management support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational
performance for their fruit.
Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. The chief executive and chief financial officer provide a letter of representation to the Board confirming that the financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and fairly present the
financial position of the Group and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year. Seeka also considers environmental, social and
governance impacts, and discloses to the market any factors that may materially affect operations.
Seeka's Sustainability Committee provides strategic guidance on its environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework, targets, measures and
performance. Since 2020, Seeka has been reporting its ESG initiatives in the annual and interim reports, and in June 2024 Seeka published its third
sustainability report.
Seeka's 2024 Sustainability Report details Seeka's journey to be a sustainable business and Seeka's aim to be net zero carbon by 2050, and an
employer of choice that provides excellent service to Seeka customers while supporting the wellbeing of our communities.
In February 2024, Seeka released its first climate-related disclosure report, compliant with the New Zealand Climate Standards (NZ CS1-3) for NZXlisted companies. Seeka provides insights into climate-related risks and opportunities, and explains how Seeka plans to build resilience in response to
climate change.

Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chair uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration within
a two year period, with shareholders approving any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in April 2022, when
the pool limit was set at $610,000 per annum. As part of Board succession planning, the Board has had eight directors since 1 November 2024. Board
chair Fred Hutchings will retire at the 16 April 2025 annual shareholders meeting, after which the Board shall revert to seven directors.
As determined by the Board, the directors are remunerated by a base director fee, a Board chair fee, and chair or membership fees for three Board
committees as per the following schedule that was presented to shareholders in April 2022. The total Board chair fee will not exceed $140,000,
irrespective of whether the chair would otherwise be eligible for committee fees.

As per the remuneration policy set out in the Board Charter, directors are remunerated by fixed fees reflecting the time commitment and
responsibilities of the Board and committee membership, with no equity-based remuneration or performance incentives. The Board has never
proposed a director retirement payment, and Seeka's Constitution requires that any such proposal would first require shareholder approval. Directors
are encouraged but not required to own Seeka shares. Director shareholdings are disclosed on page 89.
The following table reports the annual allocation of the pool in 2024, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. Non-italics are committee
members at year end, italics are part-year membership in 2024, see page 87 for details. No other benefits were provided to directors.

Principle 6. Risk Management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”
The Board considers risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific
focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.
While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
Principles and Guidelines.
Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
performance against budget and forecasts.
Seeka has appropriate insurance cover. In 2023, as part of a long-term risk management strategy, Seeka established Seeka Risk Management Limited;
a captive insurance company registered in the Cook Islands, to provide the Group with direct access to the international reinsurance market.
The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry. Board meetings include periodic site visits in
New Zealand and Australia to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.
The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated
with being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing
revenue from more points along the value chain.
The following summarises the key material risks which the Board have identified and the associated mitigation strategies.

Health and safety
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews monthly reporting and performance against set targets at each meeting, as well as in depth sessions
on health and safety.
Our people work in multiple, complex environments, and we focus on integrating safety into everything we do. Over the full year, the Group employed
5,860 people, with Group salary and wages equating to 1,997 full time equivalents.

TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
2. Permanently disabled or requiring immediate in-patient hospitalisation.

Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”
Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the market
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.
The Audit and Risk Committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit
process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk committee:
• Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and
• Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.
The Board appointed Grant Thornton as Seeka's auditor on 29 August 2023.
Grant Thornton has confirmed its independence to the Audit and Risk Committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the
reporting period. Grant Thornton auditors will attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.
In FY24, $479,000 was paid or accrued to the external auditors Grant Thornton; ($473,625 for 2024 audit fees, disbursements and half year
procedures, and $5,375 for debt covenant compliance certificate agreed upon procedures).

Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to external
audit findings.
Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated internal audit function, Seeka uses its assurance and compliance team to
conduct internal audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s
financial systems. Directors also consider matters raised by the external auditor.

Principle 8. Shareholder Rights and Relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”
Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of "founded on relationships".
The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
• Annual and interim reports
• Annual sustainability report
• Market announcements
• Annual shareholder meeting
• October stakeholder meeting
• Ad-hoc investor presentations
• Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and stakeholder update either in person or online, where they can
raise matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which affect Seeka at the annual shareholder
meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar MUFG Pension & Market Services (formerly Link Market Services) and overseen by
the company’s external auditor on a one share, one vote principle.
Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar
MUFG Pension & Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. Notices of shareholder meetings are posted on the NZX website and Seeka's
website. Where circumstances allow, Seeka sends notices of shareholder meetings at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s
announcements can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.
When raising new capital, where practical, the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company on a pro
rata basis so they can maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.
Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK.

Differences in practice to NZX Code
The following table summarises the material differences between Seeka’s corporate governance and the Code during the year. Where there are
differences, these have been approved by the Board.
Principle
2. Board
Composition
and
Performance

Concerning
2.5 An issuer should have a written diversity policy which
includes requirements for the board or a relevant
committee of the board to set measurable objectives
for achieving diversity (which, at a minimum, should
address gender diversity) and to assess annually both the
objectives and the entity's progress in achieving them.
The issuer should disclose the policy or a summary of it.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024

Key difference
Seeka's Diversity Policy is a guidance
document that underpins an inclusive
work culture. It does not set measurable
objectives, noting that Seeka is a large
employer drawing on the local communities,
along with people from the Pacific and Asia
through the RSE scheme.

Summary of waivers granted by NZX
On 15 October 2024, a waiver from NZX Listing Rule 5.2.1 was granted by NZ RegCo, New Zealand's listed market regulator. The waiver allows
Seeka to enter into post-harvest agreements with persons associated with Seeka directors (being, related party growers) without having to obtain
shareholder approval in accordance with Rule 5.2.1. Rule 5.2.1 provides shareholders with the opportunity to review transactions where the Board may
have been subject to an actual or perceived influence by a related party. In granting the waiver, NZ RegCo considered that Seeka's related parties and
their associated directors will not exercise undue influence to achieve a favourable outcome from entering into Seeka post-harvest agreements, as the
agreements are prepared by management, standardised, and offered to all growers, including related party growers, on the same terms. Reliance on
the waiver is conditional on:
• Seeka’s independent directors certifying that:
– the granting of the waiver is in the best interests of Seeka and Seeka’s shareholders who would not be precluded from voting under Rule 6.3 to
approve the post-harvest agreements with related party growers; and
– entry into of the post-harvest agreements with related party growers is in the best interests of Seeka, all of Seeka’s shareholders, and
shareholders who would not be precluded from voting under Rule 6.3,
and that the certificate include a summary of the core grounds for those certifications. That certification was made on 16 October 2024; and
• the waiver, its conditions and implications being disclosed in all Seeka’s annual reports.
See seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements for details.
Directors Peter Ratahi Cross and Stewart Moss are associated with related party growers that entered into post-harvest agreements with Seeka
during the year ended 31 December 2024 for the supply of post-harvest services by Seeka. All related party transactions were made on normal
commercial terms and conditions and at market rates. The terms of the post-harvest agreements for the year ended 31 December 2024 were
entered into and negotiated on a commercial basis, following the process set out in the waiver. The aggregate gross revenue received by Seeka for
the year ended 31 December 2024 related to these transactions with related party growers was $10.9m. See the disclosures under the sub-heading
Transactions in note 27 to the financial statements on page 58 and the interests register on page 88.
No other waivers were granted, published or relied on by Seeka in the year ended 31 December 2024.
