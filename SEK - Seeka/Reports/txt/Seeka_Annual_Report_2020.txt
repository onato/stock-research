ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
It is our pleasure to provide you with this commentary on Seeka’s financial and operational performance for the year ended
31 December 2020. Without doubt, 2020 was the most challenging year since Psa impacted the kiwifruit industry.
This report provides details on the audited results for the 12 months, operational performance of our business segments, the
impact of Covid-19, health and safety, Seeka’s strategy, capacity and automation, the Seeka team, shareholder dividends and
business outlook.
Covid-19, drought, a change to kiwifruit clearance protocols and severe labour shortages created unprecedented operational
and financial challenges for our New Zealand and Australian businesses. While contending with additional costs from stringent
hygiene protocols, Seeka received no Government wage subsidy in 2020.
Despite the challenges, the Group successfully completed all harvests; an outstanding achievement by our people who continued
to provide an essential service as Covid-19 posed a very real threat to their health and the welfare of their whānau. Our people
responded with commitment and innovation, drawing together as a team to deliver a timely harvest to our growers and business
continuity to our stakeholders. This continued into the second half of the year with the New Zealand avocado and Australian
pear and apricot harvests. Seeka strives to provide our customers with a reliable supply of high-quality produce as we manage
challenges across our supply chain. For example, nearly every consignment of Seeka New Zealand avocados experienced
significant disruption.
Our teams continued to excel and their commitment and drive have delivered our shareholders and growers outstanding results.
The team focussed on getting the job done.
Seeka delivered a higher profit despite facing higher costs, a limited labour force and lower fruit volumes from summer drought.
The company lowered debt and maintained shareholder dividends, and our customers were delighted with the quality of our
produce.
Improving underlying financial performance is a key focus for the company.
Seeka continued to sell down Northland orchards and has sold and leased back three Australian kiwifruit orchards. Taking more
than 12 months to transact, the Australian sale realised profit, lowered debt and provides confidence to continue developing
Australian orchards.
Finally, by way of introduction, Seeka progressed initiatives that address the risks and opportunities of climate change. The
Board established a sustainability committee to work with management and develop actions and strategies to become a more
sustainable business. Seeka’s second annual sustainability report is included in this document with work underway to ensure
Seeka’s environmental, social and governance initiatives will be a feature of stakeholder reporting.

Review of operations
Financial
Revenue for the twelve months ended 31 December 2020 increased 6% to $251.46m (pcp: $236.87m). Consolidated earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $42.95m (pcp: $34.52m); up 24%. Profit before tax improved
by $6.42m (65%) to $16.28m and profit after tax improved by $8.27m (120%) to $15.15m.
These results include a number of gains from the continuing orchard sales along with significant improvements in Australian and
retail services operations.
Gains on orchard sales include:
–

$2.8m from the sale of Northland orchards, and

–

$6.2m from the sale and leaseback of three Australian kiwifruit orchards. The gain on sale is calculated under NZ IFRS 16
which considers leaseback commitment.

Results were impacted by:
–

$3.1m direct costs of Covid-19,

–

$2.2m from productivity losses and Covid-19-related constraints, and

–

$5.0m from the estimated effects of the drought on Hayward production volumes.

Additionally, there was a deferred tax benefit of $5.6m from the reintroduction of tax deductibility of depreciation on buildings.
Net cash flow from operations totalled $26.35m, compared against $18.59m in the pcp.
Seeka received $43.04m in proceeds from properties held for sale (pcp: $44.53m) and invested $13.50m in property, plant and
equipment (pcp: $34.67m). In addition, Seeka invested $6.78m in long term leased orchards in New Zealand, $1.07m in orchard
developments in Australia and $1.00m in the Wai O Kaha Gold Landowners Limited Partnership. Working with the Provincial
Growth Fund and local hapū, this partnership is developing 40 hectares of Hayward orchards at Raukokore on the East Cape.
Net debt at 31 December 2020 was $77.85m (pcp: $116.79m) (bank loans less bank deposits); a decrease of $38.93m, driven by
the planned disposals of orchards held for sale. This reduction reflects our strategy of reducing bank borrowings used to acquire
Northland kiwifruit orchards and business from T&G, and Aongatete Coolstores Limited. Seeka continues to review its asset
holdings to ensure they are consistent with strategy and earn the cost of capital.

New Zealand orchard operations
Orchard operations span from Northland through to the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast, with orcharding covering the
growing of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry on leased, long term leased, and Seeka-owned orchards. This business also provides
comprehensive orchard management and vine management services to orchard owners and develops orchards under contract
for landowners under long term leases, including in partnership with iwi.
12.98m trays of kiwifruit were grown in 2020, compared to 11.42m trays in the pcp. For the second year, Hayward volumes were
affected by drought, being down an estimated 0.5m trays. At an average 10,200 trays per hectare in 2020, Hayward yields were
below the five-year average of 10,800 trays per hectare. While we expect drought to become more common in the future, the
2021 outlook is an improvement in volumes and fruit size, particularly for Hayward.
Seeka also grew 1,041,677 kilograms of avocado (pcp: 732,000 kgs) and 171,750 kilograms of kiwiberry (pcp: 64,400 kgs).
Orchard operations revenue of $75.71m is up $3.29m from the pcp reflecting higher returns from Zespri, higher avocado returns
and the sale of a small amount of SunGold license.
EBITDA for the year totalled $5.44m compared to pcp $4.99m after paying higher labour and compliance costs.
Seeka has a strategy to continue investing in long term leases to secure supply, with fruit volumes set to increase as these
orchards reach maturity. This includes the $1m investment in the Wai O Kaha Landowners Limited Partnership in conjunction
with local Raukokore hapū and the Provincial Growth Fund. In addition, we are developing a new seven-hectare SunGold orchard
in partnership with Ngāti Pūkenga in Welcome Bay.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

New Zealand post harvest operations
Post harvest operates eight major facilities spread throughout the major growing regions in the North Island, and handles all
produce from our orcharding operations and from our independent growers.
In 2020, Seeka packed 33.4m trays of kiwifruit (pcp: 33.5m), down on expectation as drought impacted volumes by an estimated
2.4m trays, along with a loss of supply as new maturity protocols caused a short-term harvest rush whereby the volumes of fruit
deemed mature for harvest outstripped our capacity over a short period. Post harvest packed 760,000 trays of avocados and
82,000 trays of kiwiberry as well as contract packing citrus and blueberries in Kerikeri.
Post harvest revenue of $140.09m is similar to last season (pcp: $140.11m) reflecting a shorter storage year and selling season.
Costs increased from Covid-19 protocols, lower than expected volumes, and higher wage rates. EBITDA of $41.87m, while up on
the pcp’s $40.98m, is down on expectation.

New Zealand retail services operations
Includes the supply, export and sale of avocados, kiwiberry and class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, sale of New Zealand kiwifruit
through collaborative programmes, operation of the New Zealand wholesale marketing business including imported tropical
fruits, and the manufacture and sale of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.
A remarkable increase in revenue was achieved with a total of $21.80m compared to pcp of $12.30m (up 77%).
EBITDA of $3.00m is 79.6% up on the pcp’s $1.67m. This was achieved from a sound strategy and good execution of the plan.
Momentum continues to build with vibrant leadership, dedicated staff, great customer relationships, and high quality produce.

Australia operations
Seeka Australia Pty Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned company, leases and operates kiwifruit orchards, and owns and operates
nashi and pear orchards along with associated post harvest facilities in Victoria, directly marketing Seeka’s Australian produce
domestically and to export customers.
Kiwifruit yields were lower than expected following a very hot and dry summer which impacted fruit size. The kiwifruit business,
however, remains profitable. Green nashi sales returned to profitability as Seeka balanced supply to demand. Seeka sold its first
crop of the exciting new Ricó pear variety in 2020.
Total revenue for the year of $13.06m compares to pcp of $11.59m. EBITDA of $7.44m includes a $6.18m gain on sale of
Australian kiwifruit orchards. This delivered operational EBITDA of $1.26m which compares against negative $0.63m in the pcp.
The gain on sale is calculated in accordance with NZ IFRS 16 which takes into account the future lease liability with the sale price
much higher than the asset’s historical carrying value.
A tremendous job by our Australian team has made the business profitable. They executed a strategy that supplied profitable
product lines and delivered our customers excellent produce.
The sale of the mature kiwifruit orchards for AU$26.5m has reduced debt and yielded profit. Seeka has a further 63 hectares of
kiwifruit in development and a further 11 hectares of Ricó pears coming into production, and are trialling exciting new nashi pear
varieties.
Seeka remains positive about its Australian investment strategy.

Avocados and kiwiberry positive highlights
Seeka continues to build its emerging categories of kiwiberry and avocado. These varieties positively contribute to Seeka’s
earnings while delivering competitive returns to growers.
82,000 trays of kiwiberry were successfully harvested and marketed directly and in collaboration with Freshmax. Grower orchard
gate returns averaged an estimated $220,000 per hectare with the highest return over $320,000.
Likewise, Seeka’s avocado business continues to grow delivering supplying growers a premium return for their crop, while lifting
shareholder returns by utilising plant and equipment outside of the kiwifruit season.
These categories are sold under the Seeka brand, which is building a solid reputation for quality. Seeka is creating retail consumer
demand that generates superior returns to our growers.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Impact of Covid-19
Seeka proactively prepared for Covid-19 with a response committee formed prior to harvest and lockdown. The committee
included senior operational and support managers who prepared and executed mechanisms to ensure the safety of our people.
Actions included moving workers sourced from overseas through the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) programme to less
densely populated accommodation facilities. Quarantine facilities were established to house overseas workers who may have
Covid-19 like symptoms to separate them from others; this provided an excellent buffer when the normal winter flu symptoms
arrived.
When a manager of a third-party local accommodation facility was confirmed as Covid-19 positive, Seeka transferred people to
Seeka's quarantine facility until they tested negative. Seeka worked closely with the health professionals managing the Covid-19
response. The committee also sourced items including masks, gloves, sanitiser and thermometers well ahead of lockdown along
with protocols to achieve physical distancing and temperature monitoring.
Seeka’s packhouses and sites were established as “bubbles” with a total ban on personnel moving between facilities. Should
Seeka face a lockdown again, these procedures will be reinstated. The response committee continues to meet regularly and is
ensuring full preparedness for the coming 2021 harvests.
Covid-19 meant many of our experienced overseas workers were unable to return to New Zealand. The number of RSEs in New
Zealand and able to work further reduced as we responsibly aided their return once their work programme completed and they
requested to return home. We facilitated repatriation flights on their behalf. The number of continuing RSE workers for 2021 is
critically low. Seeka expects to have 460 RSEs for 2021 compared to a normal complement of 1180.
Seeka is operating a recruitment programme to attract New Zealanders to orchard work. Collaborating with the Ministry of Social
Development, the Ministry of Primary Industries, Te Arawa and Ngāti Hine, our training and induction programme is helping
interested people become “employment ready”. We are making every effort to fill the seasonal workforce, delivering training
on the available work, safety practices, well-being assessments, and skill-based training including forklift driving. This initiative
complements our long-standing orchard and post harvest cadet pathway.
Labour costs are expected to increase 18% in 2021, impacting orcharding and post harvest costs.
We worked to proactively ensure all our people were safe and in addition to our ongoing traffic management plans and guarding
upgrades we rolled out new Covid-19 protocols, including:
–

New access and egress processes ensure physical distancing,

–

New temporary tearooms,

–

Access to gloves, masks and hand sanitiser,

–

Strict 24-hour cleaning regime across all sites,

–

Work bubbles with personnel prohibited from travelling between facilities,

–

Limited site access from contractors and outside personnel,

–

Developed and deployed screens to ensure two metres of separation on all packing lines, and

–

Seeka’s wholesale markets continued to operate as an essential service, with strict physical distancing protocols.

Seeka estimates Covid-19 added $5.3m of costs to harvest 2020; $3.1m of direct Covid-19 operating costs plus $2.2m from
volume loss due to extraordinary productivity constraints.

Health and safety
This season's lockdown placed significant load on our safety programme, which was exacerbated by the severe shortage of
people. Seeka took all efforts to ensure that we kept our people safe and invested in their safety. We focus on continuous
improvement to ensure the health and safety of all personnel at all locations, with all reported incidents and near-misses
investigated. We reviewed and improved traffic management systems, installed new barriers at post harvest sites, rolled out new
fatigue-management systems, and invested in machine guarding. Forklifts are now largely segregated from post harvest areas
with foot traffic. Seeka has reviewed its tractor fleet and purchased 30 new tractors for 2021 harvest operations at a cost of over
$1m.
Disappointingly, after lockdown ended there were two post harvest serious harm incidents involving forklifts, and one in orchard
operations involving the loading of a tractor for transportation. These impacted the severity rate in the period. All incidents were
reviewed, including independent review of the post harvest incidents, as the company relentlessly drives for a safer environment.
Seeka continues to refine its safety focus.
The following table shows key safety measures against annual thresholds.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Strategic highlights
While continuity of operations was the major focus throughout the lockdown, Seeka was able to make significant strategic
progress in 2020. Kiwifruit is our core product, with the company diversifying geographically and targeting complementary
produce categories. The focus is on growth that delivers accretive value to our stakeholders, including shareholders, growers,
employees, contractors and community. We work to deliver our marketers, principally Zespri, the highest quality fruit and deliver
our growers great returns through our supply chain.
Seeka has excelled where it operates the entire value chain from the orchard to the customer and delivered incremental
returns to growers; as demonstrated by avocados and kiwiberry. We deliver orchard-to-market excellence in New Zealand
kiwifruit, avocados, class 2 kiwifruit, and kiwiberry, along with Australian kiwifruit, nashi and European pears, and have achieved
an excellent improvement in the operational and financial performance of our New Zealand retail services and Australian
businesses.
Seeka has focussed on consolidating its position, refining its management structures, and selling orchards with secure supply
contracts to reset debt while pursuing operational excellence.
The company has focussed on asset utilisation and capacity planning and has substantially built the infrastructure to handle the
anticipated immediate volumes. Seeka has deliberately positioned itself in Northland to provide excellent service to the region’s
growth in avocados and kiwifruit and has increased its avocado market share.

Capacity and automation
Analysis of future crop volumes indicate that Seeka has sufficient post harvest capacity for the 2021 and 2022 seasons,
with additional capacity required for 2023. The company is evaluating options for capacity expansion and is considering the
development of a new post harvest complex on the Pukenga Orchard in Young Road, Te Puke. The Board is expected to consider
this investment mid-year with any construction occurring in 2022.
Seeka continues to evaluate and deploy automation and information systems to drive efficiency, including in-shed automation
technology that reduces labour. New on-orchard scanning technology is providing an exciting opportunity to improve on-orchard
efficiency and reduce costs. By providing accurate measurements, the technology will improve winter pruning, crop optimisation
and crop estimation.

The Seeka team
We are very proud of the performance and commitment of all employees in what was a challenging year both operationally and
personally for everyone.
We have a clear strategy to be the employer of choice in a tight labour market. The company has increased wages and continued
to implement competitive remuneration levels. Talent development is one of our key platforms and we have created new joint
ventures to recruit and train New Zealanders to work in our industry.
Seeka actively sources New Zealand workers to fulfil peak seasonal labour demand and operates in parallel a RSE programme
that delivers focussed pastoral care for our overseas’ workers. Of our 3,500 strong seasonal workforce, 1,073 were scheduled to
come from overseas via this scheme. Seeka remains engaged with the New Zealand Government, noting that even with higher
domestic unemployment there remains insufficient local seasonal labour to safely undertake the harvests.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Dividend
A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid 30 March 2021 to
all shareholders on the register at 5pm on 5 March 2021. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the
strike price. The total dividends distributed or declared in the 12 months to 31 December 2020 is $0.22 per share (12 months to
31 December 2019 - $0.24).

Outlook
Seeka remains focussed on delivering its strategy to deliver incremental earnings and returns to both shareholders and growers.
Lifting the base business operating profits is one of our strategic platforms. While kiwifruit is Seeka’s foundation crop, the
company also has a growing fruit bowl including avocados, kiwiberry, nashi and European pears across New Zealand and
Australia. We are a growth company and we continue to focus on profitable growth.
Additional capacity is required for the 2023 season with key investment decisions to be made in 2021.

Summary
We are proud of how the company has performed in an unprecedented, challenging environment. Covid-19 tested the resilience
of our people, but with their dedication and leadership the Seeka team and our community got the job done.
The company is responding to a changing climate and environment by the creation of a Board sustainability committee and
targeted initiatives intended to "Grow a Better Future", as detailed in the sustainability report.
Seeka ends the year having achieved a record profit, maintained dividends and significantly lowered debt. We are ready and
prepared to continue our growth journey knowing that lifting base profitability is a key strategic platform.
We thank all growers, shareholders and stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willingly give to Seeka.

ORCHARD-TO-MARKET PRODUCE HANDLER
Seeka’s works to supply premium, healthy produce to international
consumers. We’re a cornerstone handler of New Zealand-grown kiwifruit,
and also supply significant volumes of New Zealand avocado and kiwiberry.
We’ve also expanded our operations in Australia where Seeka is that
country’s largest producer of kiwifruit and nashi.

Seeka handles 20%
of New Zealand's $2b
kiwifruit export industry

Our services and our clients
Seeka’s core product is kiwifruit, our core operation is post harvest services,
and our core clients are orchard owners. We handle a fifth of New Zealand’s
annual kiwifruit crop, and charge our clients a per-tray fee to grade, pack,
coolstore and send their crop to the port for export.
Seeka also helps our clients by managing their orchards at cost plus a perhectare fee, or we may lease their orchards, in which case Seeka owns the
crop and shares the profits of fruit production. Seeka also develops orchards
on long-term leased land, owns these orchard investments for the duration
of the lease, and shares profits of fruit production with the landowner.
Each season, Seeka’s orchard management, leasing, and long-term leases
produce around 8% of the national crop, and help secure product for our
core post harvest business.
While New Zealand kiwifruit exports beyond Australia are managed by
the industry-regulated marketer, we’re optimising our clients’ returns
through our New Zealand and Australian sales programmes. Each season
we market around 5% of kiwifruit produced on our New Zealand clients’
orchards and collect a commission on market returns.

Expanding our product range
Our business works along the supply chain from orchard to market, and
we’re a key service provider in the large North Island horticulture regions.
We’ve expanded our operations and added revenue streams by servicing
the fast-growing avocado sector and the niche kiwiberry market. Seeka
provides the same integrated orcharding, post harvest and retail services
to our avocado and kiwiberry orchard clients, with one key difference;
Seeka markets all avocado handled by our business, and half of our clients’
kiwiberry crop. All produce is Seeka branded and sold in Australia, Asia and
in New Zealand’s domestic market.
We’ve leveraged our expertise in supply chain management to import and
condition tropical fruits for New Zealand retailers, and recover avocado oil
and the digestive aid Kiwi Crush from process-grade fruit.

Expanding our geographical reach
With Australia the key market for our New Zealand-grown kiwifruit,
avocado and kiwiberry, Seeka has grown our Australian service by
producing kiwifruit, nashi and European pears on Seeka-owned and leased
orchards in Victoria, Australia. Seeka brands and markets its Australian
produce to the Australian domestic market with export channels to Asia
and Europe, collecting all market returns.

Seeka grows 8% of the
national kiwifruit crop

Along with kiwifruit, we also
produce, market and export
avocado and kiwiberry

SEEKA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
Sustainability focuses on meeting present needs without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
needs. Sustainability is composed of three pillars; economic,
environmental and social. Seeka’s ambition is to measure then
incrementally improve our environmental and social performance
and the associated governance processes.

Set by the Board, Seeka’s strategic direction is based on the
sustainable production and supply of healthy produce.
Environmental sustainability lies at the heart of Seeka’s brand
attribute Growing Futures; our process of continually improving
operations to deliver healthy produce, use less resources, care for
the environment, and deliver better outcomes to our stakeholders.

We aim to be an industry leader on reporting the impact of
climate change and focus our operations to minimise our
environmental footprint. We know that the environment plays a
pivotal role in the health of our crops, and our business.

Social responsibility lies at the heart of Seeka's brand attribute
Founded on Relationships; we value the connections to our
communities and we care for the welfare of our clients,
employees, investors and the regions we operate in.

We are founded on relationships and are serious about our social
responsibilities. We operate so our grower clients can provide
global consumers with healthy food choices. We want to be
the provider and employer of choice, and we know that strong
communities play a pivotal role in the health of our business.

Environmental report
We established the Seeka Agile Sustainability Team (SAST)
to develop our sustainable culture. Connecting passionate
people from across the company, SAST is working to integrate
sustainability into the hearts and souls of our employees and
deliver projects that reduce Seeka’s environmental footprint.

Governance
In 2020, Seeka established a Board sustainability committee
tasked with providing strategic guidance and feedback to the
Board and management on Seeka's sustainability framework,
targets, measures, and performance. Comprised of three
directors, Seeka’s sustainability committee is a forum for
assessing and providing advice on the potential impacts and
opportunities of a changing climate.

Climate change is an active risk, impacting the yield, quality
and marketability of the produce we handle. By disclosing our
climate-related risks, stakeholders can see how we are flexing our
operations as we prepare our business to mitigate the risks and
embrace new opportunities.
We mapped our operations to identify and understand the
inputs we rely on for production, how they flow through our
business, and the waste outputs that impact our environment.
We are working to transition to a circular model whereby waste
is circulated back into our operations, thereby reducing our
environmental footprint.

Environmental and social strategy
Intelligent growth and commercial nous underpin our shared
prosperity. We embrace and care for our environment, those
contributing to the journey and our communities.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Our 2021 environmental work programme
Scenario analysis – understanding how a changing
climate impacts fruit production
Scenario analysis is underway to gauge how higher temperatures,
reduced water availability and rising sea levels may impact New
Zealand orchard production.

The primary mitigation tool is the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions. Seeka is currently quantifying our emissions using the
Ministry for the Environment’s Guidance for Voluntary Greenhouse
Gas Reporting, which scopes emissions into three categories:
–

Scope 1 covers direct emissions from Seeka-owned or
controlled sources.

By understanding how a changing climate may impact crop
loads and quality, Seeka can prepare our operations to provide an
efficient, sustainable service to our grower clients and a reliable
product supply to the international consumer.

–

Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from generating electricity
that Seeka directly uses.

–

Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur along
Seeka's value chain.

Carbon footprint – measuring and setting targets

We are calculating our emissions for 2019 and 2020 using ISO
14064-1: 2018 Greenhouse Gases and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(ghgprotocol.org), with our calculations being verified by a market
leader in carbon footprint measurement. Once completed we can
quantify our carbon-reduction targets.

Seeka is committed to lowering our carbon footprint and we have
aligned with Government targets under the Paris Agreement
intended to limit global temperature increases to 1.5°C to 2°C.

Carbon reduction initiatives
As we work to measure our emissions, Seeka has already embarked on a series of carbon-reduction initiatives.

Hybrid vehicle fleet
Seeka is encouraging hybrid selection by
transitioning our lease vehicle fleet to include
hybrid options in all vehicle classes while
dramatically reducing conventional options.
2021 goal is to have hybrids accounting for
20% of lease vehicle renewals

Worm farm
Seeka piloted an in-house worm farm in 2020.
In full production, Seeka's continuous-flow
worm farm is expected to divert 50 tonnes
of packhouse organic waste from landfill to
vermicompost, delivering a regenerative, fullycircular approach to orchard production.
2021 goal is to ramp up throughput ready for
full worm farm production in 2022

Solar energy

LED lighting

LED

Seeka is investigating packhouse LED lighting
and sensors. Electricity is one of Seeka’s largest
inputs. A reduction in electricity use will reduce
our carbon footprint and operational cost.
2021 goal is to trial LED lighting sensors

Waste audits
Seeka has developed a waste audit programme
to identify, measure and report the volume
and type of waste produced by our operating
business units. Waste reduction plans are
being developed at a business unit level. The
first waste audit was undertaken at head office
and a waste reduction plan is currently under
development.
2021 goal is to complete and monitor head
office's waste reduction plan and scope
orchard and post harvest operations

In 2018 Seeka installed solar panels at the
Seeka 360 head office. The panels generate
about 30% of office power usage at the middle
of the day. They also feed batteries which
supply back-up energy in the event of a power
outage. By December 2020, the panels have
generated 74MWh of electricity.

Regenerative horticulture

2021 goal is to investigate solar alternatives for
our post harvest facilities

2021 goal is to foster regenerative horticulture
by sharing findings with our grower community

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Seeka is researching soil types and practical
ways to incorporate regenerative horticulture
practices. This includes new mowing and
spraying protocols that allow orchards to
naturally retain higher carbon and water levels.

21

Social report
Seeka's responsibility to support healthy communities was central
to the 2016 rebrand that expressed our growth into new products,
new regions and new communities.
With Select Excellence we defined our business model as striving to
continually improve our performance for our stakeholders; to deliver
an excellent service that supports healthy communities. By delivering
excellence, we offer our stakeholders choice when selecting a
partner that cares for their economic and social wellbeing.
Social responsibility

Basis of preparation
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements. Accounting policies which are
limited to a specific note are described in that note.

Reporting entity and statutory base

Basis of consolidation

The financial statements presented are those of the consolidated
Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as Seeka Limited or the
Company. The group is referred to as the Group, Seeka, or Seeka
Group.

Subsidiaries

Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New
Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets
Conduct (FMC) Reporting Entity for the purposes of the FMC Act
2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the
NZX main board equity security market (NZX Main Board).

Nature of operations
Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
In New Zealand the Group provides orchard management, orchard
leasing, post harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit,
avocado, citrus, berry and kiwiberry industries. Seeka manufactures
and sells the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product range along with
avocado oil. The Group also provides retail and ripening services for
imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale market.
In Australia, Seeka owns, leases and operates orchards and associated
post harvest assets, making the Group the largest producer and
supplier of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of
European pears, plus lesser production of other temperate-climate
fruits, including plums and apricots.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the FMC
Act 2013. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),
incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other applicable financial
reporting standards as appropriate for profit-oriented entities. The
Group financial statements also comply with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with
the exception of:
– assets held for sale at fair value (note 9)
– land and buildings at fair value (note 10)
– water shares at fair value (note 11)
– biological assets - crop at fair value (note 12)
– right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities at present value of
expected cash payments (note 13)
– financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at
fair value through comprehensive income (note 30 and note 31)

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intragroup balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting
from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets exchanged, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date the acquisition is
settled. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on
transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency (NZD) using the exchange rates prevailing during the month
of that transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income
statement. The presentational currency is the New Zealand dollar
(NZD).
Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of
which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
– Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the
Group are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance
sheet;
– Income and expenses for each entity's income statement and
statement of other comprehensive income, are translated at
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
– All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other
comprehensive income.

Summary of significant accounting policies
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the
periods presented in the financial statements.

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
financial statements are set out below.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the
Board) on 26 February 2021.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future
operational and financial performance. By definition, these
assumptions may not always equal actual results. The estimates
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are
identified in the notes below. Estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as
adjusted for current market conditions and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Assumptions underlying management’s estimates
can be found in the following notes to the financial statements.

Statement of financial performance
Post harvest revenue was minimally impacted by the effect of
Covid-19, although profit was less than expected as kiwifruit packing
charges were set before the packing season began and were not able
to be adjusted for the additional costs incurred to maintain stringent
distancing and hygiene protocols, and the reduced efficiency of
packing during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Revenue from orchard operations remained solid, due to strong
kiwifruit returns resulting from international demand for kiwifruit as
a healthy product, and volumes being consistent with the prior year,
although down on expectation due to a dry summer.
Revenue in the retail services operations segment, which includes
Seeka’s wholesale market operations in Auckland, was impacted due
to reduced wholesale market demand from independent fresh produce
retailers who were closed during the level four and level three Covid-19
lockdowns, including the second Auckland lockdown. Demand for the
Group's Kiwi Crush, Crushies ice blocks and avocado oil which are
sold in retail stores and to schools was also down during the Covid-19
lockdown periods. The reduction in revenue flowed through to reduced
profit levels for the retail services operations segment.

Going concern assumption
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis.

Goods and services tax (GST)
The statement of financial performance and statement of
comprehensive income have been prepared so that all components are
stated exclusive of GST. All items in the statement of financial position
are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables,
which include GST invoiced.

The statement of financial position is healthy and Seeka operated
profitably throughout the year despite the economic environment.
The completion of the Australian sale and leaseback transaction in
December 2020 meant that net bank debt was reduced to $77.9m.
Trade receivables and payables maintained consistent levels through
the normal course of business and no significant receivables were
required to be written off as a result of their doubtful recoverability.
Land and building property values significantly increased this year
with an additional $11m being recognised in the land and building
revaluation reserve due to an increasing demand for industrial
buildings, particularly in the fruit processing industry, see note 10.
At year end Seeka performed impairment tests for:
– goodwill recognised in the balance sheet ( see note 11),

Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the
entity

– crop recognised as a biological asset for harvest 2021, and

There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have
been issued and are effective that are expected to have a significant
impact on the Group.

The Group compares the carrying amount of net assets with the
market capitalisation value at each balance date. The share price at
31 December 2020 was $4.85, equating to a market capitalisation
of $156.19m. This market value excludes any control premium and
may not reflect the value of Group net assets. The carrying amount
of Group net assets at 31 December 2020 was $176.30m ($5.47 net
assets per share). Management and directors considered all reasons
for this difference and concluded all relevant factors were considered
for their value in use tests. The impairment test performed over the
Group’s net asset value did not identify any impairments.

Current economic environment
The 2020 financial year presented a number of challenges from the
economic environment as a result of Covid-19. Seeka continued to
operate as an essential business for fruit production, processing and
the wholesale market operations throughout all levels of Government
lockdowns in New Zealand and Australia. The kiwifruit harvest started
as New Zealand went into level four lockdown and finished early June
when the country was at level two. While the impact on revenue was
minimised the increased health and safety measures that were rolled
out, including protective screens, face masks, and other personal
protective equipment, caused a significant increase to operating
expenses and reduced operating efficiency.
There are no other material impacts from Covid-19 noted outside of
those in the listed notes below.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

– the Group’s net asset value.

Future impact
The upcoming 2021 harvest is looking positive and the future
projections for Seeka remain strong. While labour availability will be
an issue for the coming harvest, (see note 28), Seeka has a number of
mechanisms in place to recruit local workers and has secured some
employees under the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme.
Labour costs are also expected to increase by 18% in 2021, which has
been included in the impairment tests performed, see note 11.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in business
activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a
manner consistent with the internal reports provided to the chief
decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the
allocation of resources alongside operational outcomes, such as
EBITDA and EBIT, and are responsible for setting strategic direction.
The Group has five operating segments:
– Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary
services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the
retail sector.
– A single Australian segment encompasses the integrated business
associated with the Group’s Australian-grown produce.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each
segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs and
other income from the sale of assets recorded in the statement of
financial performance are allocated to all other segments. Transactions
between segments are conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated
on consolidation.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations

Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and
internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This
includes fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post
harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported fruit, and operates a wholesale market.
Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi
Crush, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and hospitals,
along with post harvest services for kiwiberry.
All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower
services and overhead sections recorded in the statement of financial
performance and impairment and revaluations of other assets not
attributed directly to any other segment. It also includes the gain on
sale from assets that had been classified as held for sale.

Australian operations
The Group grows, provides post harvest services, and retails all
produce from orchards the Group owns or leases in Australia. The
main products are kiwifruit, nashi pears and European pears, which are
primarily sold in Australia. Included in the 2020 result is a one-off gain
from the settlement of the sale and leaseback transaction, see note 9.

The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
orchard owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
citrus, berry, and kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the
Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from
independent orchard owners.

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Accounting policies
The Group’s major revenue streams are post harvest operations,
orchard management, retail services and Australian operations in
accordance with NZ IFRS 15: Revenue.
Post harvest
The Group enters into two standardised post harvest contracts:
– The first has two performance obligations; to collect the supply
of fruit via picking and transportation, and maturity testing. The
charges are separated in the contract. All revenue is recognised
when the service is performed.
– The second has three performance obligations; to pack fruit, to cool
and dispatch fruit, and to sell class 2 fruit to authorised markets.
These are stand-alone services provided by the Group. Each
performance obligation has a separate transaction price detailed in
the contract and the obligations are recognised when services are
performed; packing revenue as fruit is packed, cooling revenue as
fruit is loaded out from cool storage, and class 2 as fruit is sold.
Orchard management
The Group enters into two orchard management contracts that are
largely standardised:
– The first has one performance obligation; to manage fruit growing.
Revenue is recognised as the service is performed and calculated at
cost plus a margin per the contract. The management fee included
in the contract is recognised evenly over the contract's 12 month
period. An incentive fee is only recognised when agreed orchard
gate return (OGR) targets are achieved and an incentive would be
receivable.
– The second has one performance obligation; to collect the supply
of fruit on short term and long term managed orchards. The
transaction price is determined using a forecasted OGR. Revenue
is recognised when crops are picked (in the June half year accounts
for kiwifruit).
Retail services
The Group enters into three retail service contracts which are
customised to the service being offered (such as ripening or fruit sales):
– The first has one performance obligation; to sell fruit on the owner’s
behalf. As the sales agent, the Group only collects a marketer’s
commission which is recognised when the fruit is sold.
– The second has one performance obligation; to either store or ripen
fruit. Revenue is recognised as the fruit is stored or ripened.
– The third has one performance obligation; to provide ordered
product. The transaction price is based on the agreed price (either
in writing or verbally) with revenue recognised when the fruit is
sold.

Principal versus agent relationship
A principal relationship is one where the Group has the performance
obligation to provide the good or service directly and has control of the
asset or has a right to direct the asset. An agency relationship is one
where the performance obligation is to arrange for the good or service
on behalf of the supplier. The Group currently has agent relationships
for the sale of some fruit and vegetables in the retail services segment.
Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations,
with post harvest revenues recognised as services are provided and
orcharding revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail
revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New Zealand kiwifruit
are harvested from March to June, avocados from July to February, and
kiwiberry from February to March. In Australia nashi and European
pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit from March to
May. As a result of these harvest timings around 60~70% of orchard
revenues are recognised in the first six months of the financial year.
Due to seasonal fluctuations, the timing of the provision of post
harvest services can vary from year to year, however normally 70~80%
is recognised in the first six months of the financial year, but can be
impacted by seasonal fluctuations.
Irrigation water rights
Water allocation rights are carried at fair value supported by the
value of the traded rights on a recognised exchange or market at
measurement date. Annual water allocation rights are recognised as
a current asset when they are allocated to the Group's permanent
water shares from the first of July each year by the Victorian Water
Register, and are subsequently expensed when the entitlement is
used to irrigate orchards. Any gain on revaluation is recognised in the
statement of financial performance.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the
effective interest method.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.
Gain on sale of assets held for sale
The gain on sale of assets held for sale is recognised when a sale and
purchase agreement is unconditional and the consideration is paid or
payable at that date.

Australia
Australian contracts are entered into by the Australian business. The
contracts are on a one-to-one basis with the fruit purchaser and are
largely standardised. There is one performance obligation; to provide
the fruit to the customer. The transaction price is based on the agreed
price (either in writing or verbally) and recognised when the fruit is sold.

During the year the Group recognised $0.15m of costs relating to the measurement of the employee share schemes issued based on the Black
Scholes Model (Dec 2019 - $0.14m).

Accounting policies
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of financial performance as incurred, except where future economic benefits arise and they
are recorded as a prepayment.
Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are
recognised in other payables. The employee liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating
sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is
recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date, and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing
for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a

business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable
profit. Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly
controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be
applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following table details the offset amounts.

Total deferred tax liability

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2019 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.
Legislation enacted 25 March 2020 reinstated tax depreciation deductions on non-residential buildings. This resulted in a one-off $5.6m gain in
the income tax calculation for the 2020 financial year, see note 6.

8. Events occurring after balance date
On 15 February 2021, settlement was reached in the matter of the kiwifruit class action against the Crown related to the 2010 Psa outbreak. The
settlement sum is $40m inclusive of GST if any. The allocation of the settlement sum is underway which includes legal cost recovery, payment to
the litigation funding partner, and distribution to claimants, of which Seeka is a claimant. The distribution will require the approval of the High Court
prior to any payment being received by Seeka. The amount Seeka will receive is currently unknown.
A dividend was declared of $0.12 cents per share to be paid 30 March 2021, see note 22.
There are no other material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

Total assets held for sale

Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will
be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and
the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and
the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within
one year from the date of classification. The accounting standards allow
for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the
delay are out of Seeka's control. Management considers the remaining
Northland orchards meet the requirements to extend past 12 months as
there is interest in the properties with sales contracts expected in the
next 12 months. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of the
carrying value or fair value less costs to sell as required by NZ IFRS 5.
At 31 December 2020, 23 hectares of orchards (Dec 2019 - 56 hectares)
owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. These properties were
part of the 2018 purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited.
Sale and leaseback transaction in Seeka Australia
Assets related to three kiwifruit orchards in Australia (Hayward, Austral
and Lakes) were recognised as held for sale at 31 December 2019. In May
2020, Seeka announced an agreement to sell 199 hectares of orchard
subject to the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB)
approval. Approval was delayed due to the onset of Covid-19, and was
subsequently granted on 8 December 2020. On 15 December 2020, the
Group completed the sale and leaseback for AUD$26.50m.
The initial term of the leaseback is 10.5 years, with rights of renewal out
to 25 years. The terms of the sale and leaseback are typical of those
entered into for an orchard.

The Group has estimated the present value of the rental obligations
in respect of the leaseback to be AUD$14.08m (NZD$15.01m), based
on the initial term of the leaseback of 10.5 years, discounted at an
incremental borrowing rate of 6.79% per annum.
The definition of a sale under NZ IFRS 15: Revenue was met and the
transaction was carried out at fair value. Sales proceeds received were
judged to reflect the fair value of the underlying assets. The quarterly
rental was deemed to be a fair market rent.
The sale and leaseback was accounted for in accordance with paragraphs
98 to 103 of NZ IFRS 16 Leases because the Group had control of the
underlying asset before the asset was transferred to the buyer, with the
transaction giving rise to the following:
– Right of use asset of AUD$7.47m (NZD$7.97m)
– Net proceeds from sale and leaseback of AUD$26.50m (NZD$28.24m)
– Lease liability assumed of AUD$14.08m (NZD$15.01m)
– Net gain on sale and leaseback of AUD$5.83m (NZD$6.18m)
Seeka entered the arrangement to release capital gains produced on the
orchards and will use the funds from the sale and leaseback arrangement
to repay debt and complete Australian developments while securing
supply for Seeka's orchard-to-market service.
All goodwill from the Australia cash generating unit was allocated in 2019
to the disposal group, based on the Group's assessment of relative fair
values of the assets held for sale and Australia assets being retained.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group used estimates to judgementally recognise the remaining Northland orchards as held for sale, despite being held for sale for greater
than 12 months. The Group used judgement to classify the Australian sale and leaseback as an asset held for sale and estimates to calculate and
judgementally recognise the gain on sale. This included judging the right of use lease asset, lease liability, lease term and estimated discount rate.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
appropriate asset class. At 31 December 2020 the assets under construction relate to the Kerikeri coolstore build, which is stage 2 of the Kerikeri
Capital Project. Stage 1 was the packhouse build, which was completed in 2019.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus any
subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers,
ANZIV, independent registered valuer.
In Australia valuations are undertaken by Preston Rowe Paterson Shepparton (previously known as Goulburn Valley Property Services),
independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. All Australian land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2019.
The valuers consider four different approaches in concert to arrive at a fair value;
1. Direct replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements based on the current cost
of construction less depreciation based on the age of the building with an allowance for physical depreciation. Specific consideration is given to
the 'optimised depreciated replacement cost' methodology.
2. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

41

3. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the property with a current market rental being established and capitalising this at an
appropriate rate of return (6.25% – 10.5%) that would be expected by a prudent investor. The 2020 year saw capitalisation rates fall between
0.5% - 0.75% since the previous valuations.
4. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the investment
method and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market rentals and estimated costs
incurred to maintain land and buildings in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are sold in the terminal year (year 11).
The net book value of land is $23.43m (Dec 2019 - $23.37m) and buildings is $147.14m (Dec 2019 - $131.14m), see note 29.
The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax of $10.43m (Dec 2019 $3.20m).

Impairment of bearer plants
For the year ended 31 December 2020, $0.03m of cherries were at the end of their useful life and removed with the remaining costs impaired.
For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group replaced some Australian bearer plants as a result of the Psa disease being identified on new
grafts. This resulted in an impairment and the write off of the carrying value of bearer plants of $0.40m which was recognised in the statement of
financial performance. There is no significant impairment relating to bearer plants in the year ended 31 December 2020.

Accounting policies
Bearer plants
Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear,
avocado and other fruiting vines and trees on Group-owned and leased
land. Bearer plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase or establish the
asset.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at
least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any subsequent
improvements at cost, less depreciation. At each annual balance date,
no less than one third of assets classified as land and buildings are
revalued and those valuations are used to assess the appropriateness
of the carrying values of all land and building assets held by the Group,
which effectively revalue all land and buildings annually. Revaluations
are performed more frequently if changing industry conditions may
cause their carrying value to differ significantly from fair value. Any
accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is
restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and
buildings are accounted for through comprehensive income and other
reserves, except where an asset's assessed fair value is less than the
original cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of
financial performance.
Property, plant and equipment
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical
cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to
purchase the asset.

42

Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other
repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of financial
performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Asset impairments are recognised in the statement of financial
performance.
Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
– Buildings
20 - 50 years
– Machinery
10 - 20 years
– Vehicles
4 - 7 years
– Furniture, fittings and equipment
– Bearer plants:

3 - 10 years
5 - 50 years

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted
if appropriate, at balance date and an asset’s carrying amount is
immediately written down to its recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is included in the
statement of financial performance. When revalued assets are sold, the
amounts included in the revaluation reserve in respect of those assets
is transferred to retained earnings.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 31 December 2020 a significant portion of Seeka's land and building portfolio was revalued. Seeka’s property values significantly increased
in the last year due to an increase in market demand for industrial properties. Seeka operates in the food production industry, which remained
stable with a high demand for healthy foods during the Covid-19 pandemic. Properties situated in the Bay of Plenty are also expected to be less
affected than other regions given the ongoing strength of horticulture and agriculture businesses.
Seeka’s Australian properties are in the food production region of Victoria. The sale and leaseback transaction completed on 15 December
supports the carrying values of the remaining properties.
Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause an increase in land and buildings of a
further 2-4%. This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

Impairment tests for goodwill
The Board reviews and monitors goodwill at a cash generating
unit level. Goodwill represents the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete
Coolstores Limited, the 2018 acquisition of the Northland business,
the previously-acquired Glassfields business (now named SeekaFresh)
and the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the
five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value in use), with a terminal
value beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period
are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates

stated in this note. The assumptions used for the analysis of the net
present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit, is
determined based on past performance and the Board's expectations of
future market development, plus the Group's five year financial plans.
No goodwill was recognised during the year. For the year ended
31 December 2019, $7.0m of goodwill was recognised from the
acquisition of Aongatete Coolstores Limited, see note 19.
All amounts recognised as goodwill at 31 December 2020 were tested for
impairment at balance date and no impairment arose in the current year.

The following table details the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations and the recoverable amount.

The following table details how water shares would be stated on the historical cost basis.

1. The discount rate is calculated based on the specific circumstances
of the cash generating unit and its operations, and is derived from
its weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate for Seeka is
set at 8% as this represents the Board's assessment of the Group's
weighted average cost of capital of 7% plus an additional 1% to
recognise the higher risk of a smaller division.
2. The long term growth rate is based on growth in GDP, market
conditions and opportunities for growth within the industry. The
Group has set its terminal growth rates between 1% - 2% to ensure
a long term conservative growth estimate has been applied in the
impairment tests.
3. If the revenue growth rates reduced to 2%, there is no impairment.
4. The revenue growth rates used for the Northland packhouse reflect
the expected increase in SunGold kiwifruit volumes as plantings
come into production during the period being assessed. If the
revenue growth rates reduced to 3%, there would be no impairment.
The negative 4% growth rate relates to an expected decline in citrus
packing in Northland in 2023 and onwards which will be replaced by
increasing Zespri SunGold volumes in the following years.
5. The revenue growth used for the SeekaFresh business reflects
the expected performance of the business over the period being
assessed. The 2% revenue growth rate is considered a conservative
estimate and no impairment is required.
6. The revenue and terminal growth rates used for Kiwi Crush reflects
expected performance over the next 5 years as the business
continues to commercialise new product lines and explore new
markets.

44

At 31 December 2020, all goodwill balances were reviewed for
indicators of impairment.
The goodwill relating to Aongatete Coolstores Limited and the
Northland packhouse are supported by 2020 operational outcomes.
2020 kiwifruit harvest volumes were in line with the prior year and
packing volumes are expected to increase in future years. Whilst
Covid-19 impacted 2020 costs and packing margins, the post harvest
segment operated profitably throughout the lockdown period. For these
reasons, there are no indications of impairment of the goodwill relating
to Aongatete Coolstores Limited and the Northland packhouse.
The goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush business is supported by
current trading performance. Having achieved 2020 targets, there are
no indications of impairment of the goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush
business.
SeekaFresh started the year well, until sales were impacted by
Covid-19. The business continued to operate as an essential service,
but was affected by the temporary closure of hospitality and
independent retail based customers during the lockdown. Following
completion of the restucturing period for SeekaFresh in 2020, the
commission business (which includes the domestic and export sales
of Seeka-grown avocado, kiwiberry, and class two, class three, and
collaboratively marketed kiwifruit), is integrated with the original
Glassfields business to a degree where is indistinguishable from the
original cash generating unit, and has therefore been included in
the forecasted revenue assumptions. The terminal growth rate has
remained consistent, but sensitivity was performed to ensure a 1%
terminal growth rate would not result in an impairment.
No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an
impairment of goodwill.
ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Accounting policies
Intangible assets
Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and
amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite life
are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually
for impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. When assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able to
generate cash flow.
Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Internally developed computer software is capitalised when it enters
the development phase and includes costs incurred to develop and
test the software for use. Intangible assets are amortised over their
estimated useful life (typically three to five years).

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill on a business acquisition is included
in intangible assets, and on acquisition of an associate is included in
investments in associates. When acquired in business combinations,
the goodwill is annually tested for impairment (or more frequently if
deemed prudent) and carried at cost less accumulated impairment
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the
carrying amount of goodwill relating to that business.
Water shares
The Group records permanent water shares at fair value based on the
market price at balance date. The shares are fully tradeable and have
an indefinite life and are not amortised.
Other intangibles
Other intangibles subject to amortisation are amortised over the life
of the asset on a straight line basis. The expense is charged to the
statement of financial performance.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The review of impairment of intangible assets uses judgement to identify indicators of impairment. The impairment testing of intangible assets
uses estimates of revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates.

12. Biological assets - crop
Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
Crop assets are kiwifruit, Nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears, other pears, cherries, avocado, apricot, and plum crops growing on leased
and owned orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.

Crop where cost is deemed fair value
Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to
have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date and
as such cost is deemed fair value, see note 29.

Accounting policies
Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s
leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair value
depends on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of
the fruit) at balance date.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is
the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (provided the costs

During the year ended 31 December 2020, no development costs
were expensed due to the effect of Psa on recently grafted crops
on producing orchards in Australia (Dec 2019: $0.50m). This was
reflected in the change in the fair value of the biological asset.
are considered recoverable). When costs are not considered recoverable
they are expensed in the statement of financial performance.
When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is
the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.
The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference
to current and expected sales returns when available. When market data
is not available an assessment is made based on historical data.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The valuation of biological assets uses estimates of market returns to determine value.

13. Right of use lease assets and lease liabilities
The Group reports all leases on the balance sheet where it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset
throughout the period of the lease, with the exception of low value leases or leases less than 12 months, as per NZ IFRS 16.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Additions
On 15 December 2020, the Group completed a sale and leaseback transaction for three kiwifruit orchards totalling 199 hectares in Australia.
The completion of this sale created a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability, with the difference between the two recognised as a gain on
sale through the statement of financial performance, see note 9.
On 30 September 2019 of the prior year, the Group entered into the sale and leaseback transaction for an orchard in Northland. The lease was
for 15 years. A right of use asset and lease liability was calculated using the incremental borrowing rate, with the difference representing a gain
on sale in 2019.

Accounting policies
Lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining
lease payments, including any renewal periods that are likely to be
exercised, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate
which ranges between 5% and 10%. The discount rate is based on the
Group's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate the Group would
borrow the funds required to purchase the asset. When determining
the discount rate, Seeka considers that the right-of-use lease asset
should not be greater than the fair value of the underlying asset being
leased.
The Group’s right-of-use lease asset is equal to the lease liability on
the day of lease inception, with the exception of sale and leaseback
transactions where the asset is measured as the proportion of the
carrying value of the asset sold of which the benefit is retained by the
Group. The right-of-use lease asset is depreciated on a straight line
basis over the period of the lease. Costs incurred with a lease that are
not part of the cost of the right-of-use lease asset are expensed.
All leases have been classified into one of the following asset classes:
– Land and building - leases for rental of all properties, including
packhouses and coolstores
– Orchard - leases held for the development of productive orchards
– Equipment - leases for equipment, including plant equipment and
forklifts
– Motor vehicles - three year leases for motor vehicles

The Group leases various properties for the packing and cooling
of kiwifruit, orchard leases to grow kiwifruit and avocados, and
equipment and vehicle leases. The terms of the leases vary, with land
and building leases ranging from 10 - 15 years, with one 99 year lease.
Orchard leases range from 5 - 15 years, and equipment and vehicle
leases range from 1 - 3 years.
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. In
the case of orchard leases, only the fixed rental is recognised as a
lease liability. Any variable consideration relating to profit share on
the orchard leases is not accounted for as the profit share is only
determined after a crop has been harvested and is not identifiable
at the commencement of the lease. Lease terms are negotiated on
an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and
conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants
other than the security interest in the leased assets that are held by
the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing
purposes.
The Group is exposed to potential future increases in land and building
lease payments based on contractual market rent reviews that are not
included in the lease liability until the rent review takes place.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and lease interest.
The lease interest is charged to the statement of financial performance
over the term of the lease.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The valuation of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities uses judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rate and the
likelihood of exercising any rights of renewal to extend the lease term.

December 2020 prepaid deposits incorporated $1.5m of deposits for avocado trees not yet received (Dec 2019 - $1.8m).
Accrued income and other sundry receivables includes income to be received from orcharding operations over leased and owned orchards
relating to 484 hectares (Dec 2019 - 481 hectares).
Within current trade receivables, $1.97m are past due (Dec 2019 - $2.13m), of which 1.6% are more than 90 days (Dec 2019 - 2.6%). Non-current
trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up to five years.
A $0.16m provision for doubtful debts was recognised in the financial statements (Dec 2019 - $0.13m).

Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group reviewed trade and other receivables for any debtor impairment, credit risk, or any other such risks that may result in nonpayment. The Group did not identify any circumstances that required further provisioning or impairment of financial instruments.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect the term
portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates via the use of derivatives, see note 30.

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Grower loyalty share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share
scheme, whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares based on their orchard's current or forecast production. This issue of up
to 2.6m shares was approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
In April 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 405 participating growers. The issue price of $4.76 per share was
funded by the Group making a $9.8m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying all product
from the participating orchards for three consecutive seasons, participating growers can elect to pay the outstanding balance of their loans, less any
dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them. Shares issued under this scheme vest in 2021 and 2022.
Employee share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible employees to participate in a five-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would
be allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business. In April 2019, 568,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf
of 319 participating employees. The issue price of $4.76 per share was funded by the Group making a $2.7m non-interest-bearing loan to the
trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can elect to pay
the outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them. Shares issued
under this scheme vest in 2022.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

19. Business combination
Purchase of shares in Aongatete Coolstores Limited
During the period ended 31 December 2019, the Group purchased 100% of the shares in Aongatete Coolstores Limited, a kiwifruit post harvest
business based north of Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. The business owned packhouse and coolstore facilities and operated an
orchard management business. The purchase was completed on 18 March 2019 for a purchase price of $14m.

The goodwill was allocated to the post harvest and orchard segments and is attributable to the operation’s strong position in the Bay of Plenty and
synergies expected to arise after adding additional post harvest and orchard facilities to Seeka’s operations. The goodwill is not expected to be
impaired in the foreseeable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of $0.20m were
included in administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $2.9m was provided in relation to differences between tax values and the fair value of certain
assets.
Land and buildings were valued using an independent valuation completed by Telfer Young Valuers using the same approach as other land and
buildings detailed in note 10.
No changes have been made since 31 December 2019.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Business combination requires the use of estimates to determine the fair value of the acquisition's assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.

The foreign currency revaluation reserve is used to record unrealised gains and losses on the Group's assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies.
The share reserve is used to record the value of option benefits recognised on the Group's grower loyalty and employee share schemes as detailed
in this note.
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
– An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
– An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust
deed established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from
the sale of shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.

Grower loyalty share scheme
Under the grower loyalty share schemes shares are issued to a share trust in return for a debt owned back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvests through to 31 March 2022. The option
benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the grower has an option to settle any
outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to them. Alternatively the grower can elect not to have the shares transferred
to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from the sale of

For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust of behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.

Accounting policies
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for
the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement
of financial performance with a corresponding increase in the share
reserve. For the Grower Loyalty Share Scheme (GLSS), the fair value of
the grower loyalty received in exchange for the grant of the option is
recognised as a discount against revenue in the statement of financial
performance with a corresponding increase in share reserve. The
fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the options
granted, calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model, excluding
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example,
profitability and sales growth targets).
When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those
shares is transferred to retained earnings.
Employee share scheme shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion
at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average

Price (VWAP) calculation of the Company's shares during the period
prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued
with further shares if that issue would result in the ESS having an
interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.
Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme
trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the
debt between ESS and GLSS and the Group on behalf of the employee.
Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited
to share capital when payment for the shares is received.
The ESS and GLSS have a non-beneficial interest in all the shares
allocated to employees and growers. Annually the Group reviews the
ESS scheme and decides upon the allocation of further shares and the
price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS
and GLSS are appointed for an unspecified term and may be removed
by the Company at any time.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The values of the employee share scheme and grower loyalty share scheme require estimates to be made of expected price volatility and the
risk free rate as detailed in this note.

Dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend
reinvestment plan. Cash dividend payment was $2.73m (Dec 2019 - $6.31m).
On 16 December 2020, the directors declared a fully-imputed special dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend was paid 27 January 2021 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 24 December 2020. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with a 2% discount to the strike price. The
Board declared the special dividend following the stronger than expected earnings in 2020 due to tight financial management and the settled sale
and lease back of part of the Australian kiwifruit orchard portfolio. This special dividend brings the total dividends distributed in the last 12 months
to $0.22 (prior twelve months $0.24).
On 25 February 2021, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend will be paid 30 March 2021 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 5 March 2021. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price.

Accounting policies
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the period but not distributed at balance date.

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but
not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the voting rights
in the entity or exercising significant influence via directors on the Board.

The Group's share of associates' profits or losses are recognised in the
statement of financial performance and the carrying amount of the
investment in the statement of financial position.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after
initially being recognised at cost.

Dividends received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying
amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

28. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to
producing and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate
financial risks related to credit, liquidity and capital risk. The Group
operates a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation programme
via its audit and risk committee.

– Drought events are typically regional, and to secure adequate
irrigation, the Group has purchased extensive, long-term water
shares from a reliable irrigation programme.

The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value
and maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources are
available for the development of the Group’s business whilst managing
its financial risks.

– Fire risk is typically from serious grass wild-fire occurring during
periods of extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority
responsible for risk assessment and management of fire events.
The Group takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk
including removing excess vegetation from Group properties.

a. Risk management strategies related to orchard and
retail operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production and
market returns. The main short-term production risks are weather
events, diseases, and pests. These impact on volume and quality
of produce from the Group's orchards, volumes to post harvest
(both from Group orchard operations and independent growers)
and volumes available to the retail business. The primary risk to the
completion of the coming harvest is the limited availability of labour
and the risk of a Covid-19 lockdown. The Group is also impacted by the
long-term effects of climate change.
Market risks include price and exchange rate impact on orchard
operations (the amount the Group is paid for growing crops and crops
grown by the Group) and impact on retail revenues where the Group
imports and sells produce, mainly bananas. The exchange rate risk
on imports is managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts
to match known and planned purchases. Market risks do not directly
impact on post harvest operations, as charges are normally set prior
to harvest and deducted before sales revenues are paid to supplying
growers.
The Group operates in four regions spread over two countries; New
Zealand's Northland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty, and in
Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce lines are
kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears and avocados, with small
production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail activities
are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce), Australia
and Asia. The Group's geographical, product and market spread limits
the impact on Group operations from an adverse event occurring in a
specific region, produce or market. To further mitigate risks, the Board
uses the following strategies.
Production risks - weather events, disease and pests
The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production risks.
This includes orchard management practices to optimise production
from Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure post harvest
and retail services are suitably resourced to manage each season's
crop volumes.
In New Zealand the major climatic risks are hail, frost, storm damage
and drought.
– Hail events are typically highly localised, and for kiwifruit the Group
has access to industry hail insurance for its orchard operations,
plus top-up payments from a Seeka Growers Limited hail insurance
programme.
– Frost events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including active frost management
on kiwifruit orchards operated by the Group and other growers
supplying the Group's post harvest operations.
– Storm events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including shelter belts on all orchards
operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's
post harvest operations.
– Drought events are typically regional, and the Group has invested
in irrigation in many of its orchards. The Group is also investing in
localised weather measurement on its orchards.

– Hail events are typically localised, and the Group currently has hail
cloth protecting one orchard.

All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest
incursions. The kiwifruit vine disease Pseudomonas syringae pv.
actinidiae (Psa) is widespread throughout New Zealand, and is
being actively managed. In 2018 Psa was detected on the company's
kiwifruit orchards in Australia. Seeka has moved to contain the
outbreak and works to proactively monitor the orchards. The brown
marmorated stink bug is also a potential threat to the horticulture
industry. To minimise the risk of crop loss the Group monitors its
orchards and undertakes recognised spray programmes to protect
crops to the fullest extent possible. Seeka also relies on the Ministry
for Primary Industries to protect New Zealand's borders from
introduced diseases.
Labour availability and Covid-19
Border closures due to Covid-19 have reduced the workforce that
Seeka relies on through the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE)
scheme and from backpackers. To assist the horticulture industry the
New Zealand Government made a provision for an additional 2,000
seasonal workers to enter the country in 2021, of which Seeka will be
able to access its share of 217 employees. Seeka has an extensive local
recruitment process underway, including working with the Ministry
for Social Development (MSD) and iwi on methods of recruiting
unemployed people into the Seeka workforce.
Long-term climate change
As a horticultural based business, Seeka is exposed to the long-term
impact of climate change through potential reduced production crop
yields. In addition to responding to weather events, future regulatory
change may impact Seeka through revised policies that limit the use
of chemical inputs on orchards, require soil monitoring and reporting,
introduce carbon taxes, and implement water restrictions.
To respond to this Seeka is;
– Working closely with regional councils and regulators to assist in
regulation change;
– Actively engaged in developing orchard management practices to
measure the environmental impact on orchards;
– Measuring the carbon footprint of Seeka's operations, with a
number of carbon-reduction initiatives underway;
– Ensuring new developments undertaken by Seeka include water
accessability as part of the development design, whether via stream
access, onsite storage, or developing wetlands; and
– Ensuring orchard reporting by altitude to assess the risk of rising sea
levels.
Market returns
New Zealand kiwifruit
The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit
harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing activities
beyond Australia are undertaken by Zespri Group Limited (Zespri)
under statutory regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the
level of Zespri's market returns which impact on the Group's orchard
profitability. The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling
techniques to analyse current and projected orchard income. This
information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease
terms.

In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As the
owner and operator of all orchards supplying its Australian operations,
the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total production base.
The orchards are located on three sites in the Mundoona region.

60

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

New Zealand avocado and kiwiberry
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocado and
kiwiberry, with half of kiwiberry sales and all avocado sales managed
by the Group's retail operations. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns. This information is used when
setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.
The Group has no direct currency risk from export sales as it does not
own the products but acts as the growers’ agent.
Imported tropical produce
The Group has a direct market, price and currency risk from imported
fruit produce (banana, pineapple and papaya) where the Group
imports fruit produce for sale as the principal through its supply
and sale contracts. The Group may hedge up to the total known and
projected cash flows to manage exchange risk. The Group has no
material direct price and currency risk from imported fruit produce
where the supply agreement enables the Group to amend its purchase
price according to trading conditions.
Australian produce
The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all
Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian
operations. As the largest single grower and supplier of Australian
kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong
relationships with key retailers. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns.
Seeka Australia is the Group’s single major international operation,
exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk
includes future commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net

investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed through
borrowings in Australian dollars, see note 30.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
customers, including outstanding receivables, derivative financial
instruments and committed transactions.
The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if
counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The
Group's maximum exposure is the carrying amount of the respective
recognised financial assets as stated in the consolidated statement of
financial position.
For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their
subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require any
collateral or security to support financial instruments due to the
quality of the financial institutions.
For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals
predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post
harvest services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is
therefore not considered significant.
Trade receivables
The Group applies the NZ IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring
expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance
for all trade receivables.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been
grouped based on days past due. The expected loss rates are based
on the payment profiles of sales over a 12 month period before 31
December 2020 and the corresponding historical credit losses during
this period, adjusted for any significant known amounts that are not
receivable.

On that basis, the following table details the loss allowance.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in
meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.

When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are
invested in interest bearing current accounts.

The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows,
liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants,
to ensure that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate
committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet
its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow
forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.

At balance date, the Group had $122.3m (Dec 2019 - $139.6m) of
available credit of which $83.0m (Dec 2019 - $119.7m) was drawn. All
credit lines are currently provided by two finance providers.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

368,246

Shareholder equity ratio

42.08%

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings times
interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position either
as investment in shares and water shares within intangible assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities,
only some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity
reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial performance
whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance was available. When no such reserve existed, any related loss is processed directly in the
statement of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.
The following table details interest rate and price sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their impact on the statement of
financial performance or equity. Cash and advance balances do not attract interest and are not subject to pricing risk, and are therefore excluded
from this analysis.

29. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The different levels are defined as:

– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement
date. Instruments in level 1 are comprised of water shares.

– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to
be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant
would use when determining an appropriate price.

Accounting policies
Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be
estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes. Fair value measurements are categorised into a three-level
hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation techniques
used.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such
as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and investment in shares)
is based on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The
quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the
current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial
liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active
market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined
using valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses the
appropriate method and makes assumptions that are based on market
conditions at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer
quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments
held.

64

The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows. Other techniques, such as
estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for
the remaining financial instruments.
Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade
receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values
due to their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and
liabilities with unobservable (level 3 inputs) reflect the assumptions
that market participants would use when determining an appropriate
price; additional disclosure is provided for the inputs and assumptions
used in such cases.
Land and buildings
Fair value is based on an annual revaluation, which is performed
on land and buildings based on a rolling three-year cycle by an
independent valuer, with approximately one third of land and buildings
assets valued each year using four different approaches as described
in note 10.

contracts are determined by Westpac and reviewed by the Board.
The gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income
appear in the statement of financial performance.
Hedge ineffectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge
relationship and through annual prospective effectiveness
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between
the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms

Accounting policies

as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates,
maturities and notional amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of
its loans, therefore the hedged item is identified as a proportion of the
outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the swaps.
Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:
– the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps
which is not matched by the loan, and
– differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans.
There was no material ineffectiveness during 2020 or 2019 in relation
to the interest rate swaps.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging

Cash flow hedge

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their
fair value at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised
as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative
is designated and effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the
hedge relationship. Derivatives are classified as current or non-current
based on the effective date.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge
relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,
exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging
instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time
remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement
of financial performance. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported
in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the
statement of financial performance within other gains / (losses).

Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At
the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation
technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are
applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are based on
quoted market rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by Westpac.

Financial instruments are not reclassified subsequent to their initial
recognition unless the Group changes its business model in which case
all affected financial instruments are reclassified on the first day of the
first reporting period following the change in the business model.

– assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI),

A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets both
of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL:

– assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL),

– it is held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows; and

– liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and

– its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding.

– other financial liabilities.
The classification of financial assets and liabilities under NZ IFRS
9 is generally based on the business model in which the financial
instrument is managed and its contractual cash flows characteristics.
On initial recognition, a financial instrument is classified as measured
at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL.

66

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for
trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent
changes in the investment’s fair value in other comprehensive income.
The election is made on an investment by investment basis.
All financial instruments not classified as measured at amortised cost
or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.

Independent auditor’s report
To the Shareholders of Seeka Limited

Our opinion
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company),
including its subsidiaries (the Group), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Group as at 31 December 2020, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended
in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ
IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

What we have audited
The Group's consolidated financial statements comprise:
●

the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;

●

the statement of financial performance for the year then ended;

●

the statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;

●

the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;

●

the statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and

●

the notes to the financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs
(NZ)) and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1
International Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence
Standards) (New Zealand) (PES 1) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International
Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA
Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of tax compliance and consulting, as well
as tax pooling. The provision of these other services has not impaired our independence as auditor of
the Group.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Description of the key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of Biological Assets- crop
The total value of biological assets at
balance date was $19.9 million. Biological
assets are disclosed in note 12 of the
consolidated financial statements and
comprise the crops on the vines and trees
(bearer plants) in the Group’s leased and
owned orchards. Certain assumptions and
inputs are also disclosed in note 29 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Our audit focused on the biological assets valued at
cost, being the most significant component of the
balance. We have evaluated judgements applied by
management to determine the crop value including
the degree of biological transformation, the
attribution of costs capitalised to the following year’s
crop and the recoverability of capitalised costs.

Biological assets are recorded at fair value.
The method to determine fair value
depends on the degree of biological
transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at
balance date. As at 31 December 2020, a
total of $19.6 million (99%) of biological
assets used cost as a proxy for fair value
because of insufficient biological
transformation.
In determining the fair value of the
biological assets, management exercises
judgement utilising industry knowledge and
internal expertise in determining the level
of biological transformation at balance date.
When sufficient biological transformation
has occurred, fair value is the estimated net
market return less selling cost and costs to
market.
When insufficient biological transformation
has occurred, the fair value is the costs
incurred at balance date to grow the crops
(provided the costs are considered
recoverable). Cost is tested for impairment
at balance date using the Group's budgets
on an orchard-by-orchard basis.
Due to the level of judgement involved in
the valuation of biological assets, as well as
the significance of biological assets to the
Group's financial position, this is
considered to be a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures included:
● Gaining an understanding of the crop life cycle
and growth periods with reference to relevant
independent horticultural industry information
to determine the appropriateness of
management’s assessment of biological
transformation.
● Testing a sample of expenses that were
capitalised to determine whether capitalisation
was valid and directly related to the unharvested
crop at 31 December 2020.
● Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models
used by management in their calculation of the
fair value of the crops.
● Reviewing management’s assessment of the
recoverability of capitalised costs. Our
procedures included comparing the expected
crop yield determined by management to the
historical production yield and expected number
of trays that can be produced per hectare based
on the land that is currently owned and leased.
We assessed whether any variances between
historical and expected volumes are consistent
with our understanding of planned changes in
the Group’s operations. Additionally, we
compared the future selling price used by
management in their model to available industry
information.
● Evaluating the historical accuracy of
management’s budget information through
comparing prior year budgets to actual results.
We had no matters to report as a result of our
procedures.

Valuation of Land and Buildings
As reflected in notes 10 and 29 of the
consolidated financial statements, the
Group has a policy of revaluing their land
and buildings on a three year rolling cycle
(excluding assets under construction). At
each balance date approximately one third
of the New Zealand Group’s properties are
revalued by an independent external valuer
using a combination of four different
approaches in concert to arrive at a fair
value.
The Group then utilises their internal
valuation expertise to evaluate whether,
based on the results of the third party
valuations and other recent market data,
the remaining New Zealand asset values
remain appropriate and materially reflect
fair value. The Group’s Australian land and
buildings were not revalued as the Group
determined the valuations in the prior year
still materially reflect fair value.
The total value of the Group’s land and
buildings at year end is $170.6 million.
We included the valuation of land and
buildings as a key audit matter because of
the level of judgement inherent in the
valuations.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit of the land and buildings of the Group
focused on the judgements inherent in the valuation
of those assets.
Our procedures included:
● Assessing the objectivity and competence of
management’s internal valuation experts and
third party valuers, in addition to assessing the
independence of the third party valuers utilised
by management.
● Utilising our PwC valuation expert, we have
assessed key assumptions used in the external
valuations by comparing the assumptions and
inputs used, such as capitalisation and discount
rates, to externally available data. Where external
data was not available, our internal expert has
utilised their experience and knowledge to
determine whether the assumptions used by the
third party valuer were reasonable and
appropriate in the circumstances.
● Reviewing and challenging management’s
assessment of the carrying values of the New
Zealand and Australian land and buildings not
independently revalued during 2020 by
comparing our own independent assessment of
valuation ranges using our PwC valuation expert.
We had no matters to report as a result of our
procedures.

Description of the key audit matter
Sale and leaseback of Australian orchards
As reflected in note 9 of the consolidated
financial statements, the Group entered
into a sale and leaseback agreement for
three of its Australian orchards, which had
been classified as held for sale assets at the
end of the previous financial year. The
Group sold the orchards for proceeds of
AU$26.5 million (NZ$28.24 million) and
simultaneously entered into a lease with an
initial term of 10.5 years and rights of
renewal out to 25 years.
The Group concluded that the arrangement
should be treated as a sale and leaseback
transaction under NZ IFRS 16 and
recognised a gain on sale of AU$5.83
million (NZ$6.18 million).
Key estimates and assumptions included:
●

Performance obligations were
satisfied in line with the
requirements of NZ IFRS 15.
● Sales proceeds received were
judged to reflect the fair value of
the underlying assets.
● The quarterly rental was deemed to
be a fair market rent.
● The incremental borrowing rate
applied upon the commencement of
the lease
● The lease term, including allowing
for the likelihood of rights of
renewal being exercised.
This was determined to be a key audit
matter due to the financial significance and
complexity of the transaction, involving
management judgement in determining the
proportion of the gain on sale that should
be recognised.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit of the sale and leaseback transaction
focused on the judgements used in determining the
accounting treatment for the transaction and on
testing the gain recognised on the sale.
Our procedures included:
● Gaining an understanding of the terms and
economic substance of the sale and leaseback
arrangements through reviewing board minutes,
discussions with management and reading of
relevant agreements.
● Engaging an internal accounting expert to assist
us in our consideration of management's view
that performance obligations were satisfied in
line with the requirements of NZ IFRS 15.
● Evaluating the selling price versus market value
of the underlying assets at the date of sale.
● Assessing the reasonableness of the quarterly
rental expense compared to rent charged on the
market for similar assets.
● Testing the assumptions used to determine the
lease term, including the likelihood of exercising
the rights of renewal, by assessing whether they
were supported by current business plans.
● Testing the accuracy of information included in
the lease calculation by comparing the inputs to
the terms in the underlying lease agreement.
● Recalculating the right-of-use asset and lease
liability for the arrangement.
● Engaging our internal valuation expert to assess
the reasonableness of the incremental borrowing
rates adopted and comparing these to
management’s rates.
● Recalculating the gain on sale and leaseback
determined by management.
● Considering the appropriateness of disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements.
We had no matters to report as a result of our

Goodwill impairment
As at 31 December 2020, the carrying
amount of the Group’s goodwill amounted
to $8.9 million as disclosed in note 11, of
which $7.0 million and $1.2 million related
to the Aongatete Coolstores Limited and
Northland packhouse cash generating units
(CGUs) respectively.
Management has performed impairment
testing for each CGU on a value in use basis,
using a discounted cash flow model based
on forecast future performance to
determine the recoverable amount.
Management performed a comparison of
the Group’s net assets to the market
capitalisation of the Company and prepared
an analysis and explanation of the
difference. Management considered the
reasons for this difference in finalising their
assessment of the recoverable amounts of
the CGUs of the Group. No impairment was
identified.
The impairment testing of goodwill is
considered a key audit matter due to the
gap between the Group’s net assets and its
market capitalisation.
There is also a significant level of
management judgement applied in
estimating the future performance and cash
flows for the Group and material CGUs,
along with the discount rate and terminal
growth rate used in estimating the
recoverable amounts.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Our audit focused on assessing and challenging the
significant estimates and assumptions used by
management in the impairment tests for Aongatete
Coolstores Limited and the Northland packhouse
CGUs, being the material CGUs, along with
evaluating the overall Group impairment test. Our
procedures included:
●
●

Evaluating the appropriateness of the CGUs
Agreeing the cash flows included in
management’s impairment model for each CGU
to the latest board approved five year plan.
● Assessing the Group’s forecasting accuracy by
comparing historical forecasts to actual results.
● Evaluating the key cash flow assumptions by
obtaining from management a detailed analysis
of the forecast production yields, sales prices,
costs and margins for the various fruit varieties.
We compared this information to historical
outcomes, our assessment of the feasibility of
management’s plans, and current market prices.
● Using our PwC valuation expert we reviewed
whether the discount rate used by management
for each CGU was reasonable. We also compared
it to relevant industry comparators. Our expert
also assessed the terminal growth rates used. ing
the accuracy of the calculations in management’s
impairment model for each CGU, and checking
the carrying amount of the CGU’s net assets was
correct.
● Performing a sensitivity analysis across a range of
reasonably possible changes in the discount rate,
cash flow assumptions and terminal growth rate.
● Reviewing the adequacy of the disclosures in the
financial statements.
We also engaged our PwC valuation expert to assist
us in our consideration of management’s paper on
the comparison between the net assets and the
market capitalisation of the Company. This analysis
was completed as part of our assessment of indicators
of impairment.
We had no matters to report as a result of our
procedures.

Our audit approach
Overview
Overall group materiality: $2,500,000, which represents approximately
1% of revenue.
We chose revenue as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the
benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most
commonly measured by users. The Group operates in a high-volume low
margin industry where net profit is not representative of the scale of the
Group.
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement, we:
• Selected two entities for full scope audits
• Performed specified audit procedures and analytical review procedures
on the remaining entities.
As reported above, we have four key audit matters, being:
●

Valuation of Biological Assets - crop

●

Valuation of Land and Buildings

●

Sale and leaseback of Australian orchards

●

Goodwill impairment

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material
misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we considered where
management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in
all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including
among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of
material misstatement due to fraud.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if,
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out
above. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit,
the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both
individually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

How we tailored our group audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The materiality levels applied in the full scope audits of the New Zealand and Australian businesses
were calculated by reference to a portion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the
business concerned, or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes where the
statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained
prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements, as
a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is
located at the External Reporting Board’s website at:
https://www.xrb.govt.nz/assurance-standards/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Who we report to
This report is made solely to the Company’s Shareholders, as a body. Our audit work has been undertaken
so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s Shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this
report or for the opinions we have formed.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Philippa (Pip)

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As at 31 December 2020
At Seeka, we conduct our business safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best outcomes for our
growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.
Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the recommendations in the NZX Corporate
Governance Code 2020 (the Code) as set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews Seeka's corporate governance
structures against the eight principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures substantially meet Code
recommendations. Any exceptions are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 83 of this annual report.
Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/co.nz/corporate-governance.
The Board approved this governance statement on 26 February 2021.

Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
followed throughout the organisation.”
Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.
Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”
Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are promoted
to staff each year including at staff meetings. The code outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and
model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”
The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:
• Conflicts of interest
• Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property
• Conduct, valuing individuals' differences and respecting all stakeholders
• Dealing with gifts or gratuities
• Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing
• Compliance with laws and Seeka policies
• Managing breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics
Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy prohibiting the direct or indirect dealing in Seeka financial products when holding inside information, plus
a duty of confidentiality that protects the dissemination and use of confidential company information.
The Insider Trading Policy defines black-out periods during which restricted persons are prohibited from trading in Seeka shares unless provided with
a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to and finishes the first trading day after key events; being the half-year
and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares. Restricted persons includes all
directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts and companies controlled by such
persons, and advisors.
Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chair of the Board, and the chair must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.
No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.

Principle 2. Board composition and performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”
Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interest of the company, to deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board Charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the duties
and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:
• Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards
• Establishing corporate objectives and strategies
• Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies
• Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance
• Managing risk to Seeka’s business
• Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication
The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.

Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth
to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings. Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives
and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between
governance and management, all directors are non-executive and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.
Seeka’s Board currently has seven directors, led by the independent chairman Fred Hutchings. Non-independent director Amiel Diaz is the only
director residing overseas.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.
Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;
• Amiel Diaz, representative of Seeka’s shareholder Sumifru Singapore Pte Limited, and former shareholder Farmind Corporation of Japan, and
• Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chairman of the Ngai Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit
grower supplying Seeka.
As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors have extensive
experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their extensive interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are considered nonindependent directors;
• Martyn Brick
• John Burke, and
• Ratahi Cross

76

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

The Board has three independent directors;
• Fred Hutchings, Board chair and remuneration committee chair
• Ashley Waugh, audit and risk committee chair, and
• Cecilia Tarrant, sustainability committee chair

Director appointments and induction
As required, the chairman establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.
Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the Group’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
Board.
The chair undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the nominations
committee and external advisors.

While there is no maximum term, the Board annually reviews director length of service and any potential impact on director independence. When the
Board recommends the re-election of a director whom has served longer than 12 years, they will explain to shareholders their rationale for supporting
re-election. All current directors have served terms shorter than 12 years.

Director profiles
Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 84 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 86 of this annual report.

Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.
The Board works to optimise diversity across director members, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity
in culture and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key
clients, creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns. Notably Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is a lecturer
in Māori history, Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia, and Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural
backgrounds.

Evaluation of board, committee and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chairman undertakes an annual review of Board, committee and director performance. The chairman's 2020
review found that the Board, committees and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified
by the Board Charter.

Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”
The Board has established three permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.
All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the sustainability, remuneration and nominations committee charters biennially and the audit and risk committee charter annually.

Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board with three independent directors. To provide effective and transparent committee
governance, while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent
director, with committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill set. The audit and risk
committee charter specifies a majority of independent directors.
The current standing committees are:

Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”
Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a midyear performance update, along with regular operational updates to supplying clients.
Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chair of the Board, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for
identifying material information between Board meetings, with continuous disclosure covered at every Board meeting.
As stewards of more than 300 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and international
guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P standard for good
agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food. See www.globalgap.org.
Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.
In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit returns;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.
Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides management
support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational performance for their fruit.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. Seeka also considers environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any environmental factors that may
materially affect operations.
In August 2020, Seeka formed a sustainability committee to provide strategic guidance on Seeka's sustainability framework, targets, measures and
performance. Seeka is working to measure then incrementally improve our environmental performance and the associated governance processes. We
know our orcharding and supply chain operations influence our environment, and we are actively addressing the risks and opportunities of climate
change. The sustainability committee provides guidance to the Seeka Agile Sustainability Team (SAST), which was formed In 2019 to develop Seeka’s
environmental and social policy and processes, and to deliver incremental improvements to the business. Drawing together staff who are passionate
about sustainability from all areas of our operations, and working with external advisors, Seeka's sustainability team is working to integrate
sustainability into the hearts and souls of our employees and deliver projects that reduce Seeka’s environmental footprint. Seeka's second annual
Sustainability report is included in this document.

Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chair uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration within
a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in April
2018, when the pool limit was set at $450,000 per annum, with the Board withdrawing a resolution to increase the pool in 2020, in response to the
Covid-19 pandemic.
Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according to expected time commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board.
Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and receive no performance or retirement benefits. Directors are not required to own Seeka shares.
The following table reports the allocation of the pool at the date of this report, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. No other benefits

Performance incentive
The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 72% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set by the Board,
including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For the 2019 financial year, chief executive officer Michael
Franks earned an $114,064 performance incentive. This payment was made in 2020.
For the 2020 financial year, the chief executive officer earned a $388,988 performance incentive. This payment will be made in 2021 .
Employee share scheme
At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated April 2019 at $4.76 per share under the 2019 employee share scheme. These shares
vest 2022.

Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”
The Board considers risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific
focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.
While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
Principles and Guidelines.
Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
performance against budget and forecasts.
The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian produce handling
and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia (when practicable with regard to Covid-19 travel restrictions)
to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.
The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated with
being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing revenue
from more points along the value chain. Since the incursion of the kiwifruit vine-killing disease Psa in 2010, Seeka has transformed from being a New
Zealand kiwifruit handler to become an Australasian produce business involved in the growing, handling, supply and marketing of multiple products.
Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post harvest processing and fruit handling facilities, along with
insurance cover for hail damage to crops.
The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB; Halyomorpha halys) remains one of the top pests of concern for New Zealand's horticultural industry. A
native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and accidentally introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s, adult BMSB feed on fruit and make them
unmarketable. The Ministry of Primary Industries is working with industry groups along with the public to prevent the unintended import of BMSB,
including eradication protocols if BMSB are detected in New Zealand. Seeka personnel and supplying growers are informed on how to identify BMSB
and the immediate actions to be undertaken if the pest is found.
Communicable diseases are a risk to labour availability, food safety and market access. Seeka works with industry bodies, the Government,
community agencies and international groups to secure reliable labour. Risk to food safety and market access is managed through Seeka's full
orchard-to-market track and trace service, which includes a register of all orchard visits and finger-scanner access to post harvest facilities. Tracing
from point of origin to point of sale allows Seeka to manage risk from contagion and ensures our markets can have confidence in the safety of our
supply chain and our products. Seeka's response to the communicable disease Covid-19 is detailed in the following health and safety section.

Health and safety
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.
In 2020 Seeka confronted a new challenge to our health and safety systems, as Covid-19 threatened community health and disrupted business
systems.
Prior to Covid-19’s detection in New Zealand, Seeka formed a Covid-19 response committee to protect our people and prepare our business. We
worked with health professionals to secure personal protective equipment and implement social distancing protocols to mitigate risk. We secured
more-spacious accommodation for RSE workers and organised quarantine housing, which was later used to isolate suspected contacts of a confirmed
community case.
During harvest, Seeka initiated new protective measures to keep our people safe as we worked to deliver an essential service. This included
designating operational “bubbles”, onsite personnel temperature logging, provision of personal protective equipment, two-metre screening, enlarged
break areas, 24-hour cleaning and remote management. We were part of a community effort that kept our whānau safe as collectively we worked
to clear our growers' crops and supply the world with safe, healthy food. Over the Level-4 lockdown period, Seeka paid $12.2m in direct salary and
wages, along with a further $3.0m to picking contractors, and had no recorded cases of Covid-19 in our workforce.
Over the full year, the Group employed more than 3,000 people working in multiple complex environments. Group salary and wages equate to 1,680
full time equivalents.

Severity rate 2

1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of hours worked.
TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
2. Severity rate = (number of lost time injuries) / (number of days lost).

Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”
Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the markets
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.
The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit
process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk committee:
• Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and
• Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.
For financial year 2020, Pip Cameron of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for Seeka Limited. Pip Cameron will complete her
five-year term as Seeka’s Auditor at the end of the 2020 financial year and Troy Florence of PwC will be the Auditor for FY21. The last audit partner
rotation was in FY16.
PwC has confirmed its independence to the audit and risk committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the reporting period.
PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.
During the year, PwC was paid $340,000 for audit fees and expenses, and $111,000 for tax compliance, pooling and consultancy work.

Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
external audit findings.
Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated financial audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s financial systems.
Directors also pay attention to matters raised by PwC, the external auditor.

Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”
Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering excellence to all stakeholders.
The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
• Annual and interim reports
• Market announcements
• Annual shareholder meeting
• Mid-year stakeholder meeting
• Ad-hoc investor presentations
• Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type
• Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors
• Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team

ANNUAL REPORT 2020 | SEEKA LIMITED

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update, either in person or when
practicable via the virtual online portal, where they can raise matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major
decisions which affect Seeka at the annual shareholder meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and
overseen by the company’s auditor PwC, on a one share, one vote principle.
Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar
Link Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. Notices of shareholder meetings are posted on the NZX website and Seeka's website. Where
circumstances allow, Seeka sends notices of shareholder meetings at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements
can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.
When raising new capital, when practical the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company so they can
maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.
Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK

Differences in practice to NZX Code
The following table summarises the material differences between Seeka’s corporate governance and the Code during the year. Where there are
differences, these have been approved by the Board.
Principle
2. Board
Composition
and
Performance

Concerning
2.8 A majority of the board
should be independent
directors.

Key difference
The Board Charter specifies a minimum of two independent directors.
As Seeka's foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers it appropriate
to have a mix of directors with extensive experience in kiwifruit production and
handling, who in the normal course of business would supply Seeka with produce
from their ongoing orcharding interests. The Board must also appropriately
represent large shareholders.

Period of non
compliance
At all relevant
times

The specified minimum of two independent directors provides the flexibility
to meet these two criteria, while also ensuring Board decisions reflect the best
interests of Seeka and its security holders.
Currently, four directors are deemed non-independent; two for their extensive
interests in orchards that supply Seeka (industry expertise), one an appointee of
a large shareholder (market expertise), and one that has extensive interests in
orchards that supply Seeka as well as being an appointee of a large shareholder
(industry expertise).
Three of the seven directors (a minority) are independent.
3. Board
Committees

3.3

Remuneration committee
should have a majority of
independent directors.

To manage workload across the Board, the charter only specifies an independent
chair. The current remuneration committee does comply with the code by having
an independent chair, an independent director and a non-independent director.

At all relevant
times

3.4 Standing nominations
committee with a
majority of independent
directors.

Nominations Committee Charter allows for the formation of an ad-hoc
committee as required. To manage workload across the Board, the charter only
specifies an independent chair.

At all relevant
times

4. Reporting
4.3 Non-financial
and Disclosure
disclosures, including
environmental, economic
and social sustainability
risks.

Seeka currently provides extensive reports on non-financial information
to shareholders and other stakeholders. Seeka's sustainability team under
the guidance of the Board sustainability committee is developing a formal
environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting framework, with the
second ESG report published in this document.

At all relevant
times

8. Shareholder 8.5 Notices of shareholder
Rights and
meetings given at least
Relations
20 working days prior to
meeting

Following implementation of Alert Level 4, on 31 March 2020 Seeka withdrew its
notice for a physical annual shareholders meeting and issued a new notice for an
online meeting to be held 17 April 2020. The new notice was issued less than 20
working days prior to the meeting. Seeka intends to provide shareholders with at
least 20 working days' notice of shareholder meetings where practicable.
