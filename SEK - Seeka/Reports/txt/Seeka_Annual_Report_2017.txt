FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Seeka is pleased to provide you with this report covering the 2017 financial year.
A seasonal reduction in New Zealand yields reduced kiwifruit harvested and processed by Seeka for the 2017 season by 21%
compared to 2016. Within this total, the Hayward (green) component reduced by 33%. The scale of this reduction and its potential to
significantly impact the company’s operational earnings was identified early. Seeka updated shareholders and took steps to minimise
costs and maximise earnings.
The steps taken by Seeka and outlined in this commentary led to a better profit from operations than forecast given the scale of the
reduction in New Zealand kiwifruit volume.
Seeka’s investment in new and upgraded plant, precooling and cool storage capacity in anticipation of higher crop volumes,
particularly Zespri SunGold fruit, meant the company was able to optimise plant configuration and staff utilisation. Growers benefited
through record low fruit loss while operational efficiencies reduced costs.
A significant change to the banana sourcing arrangements of a key retail customer led to Seeka’s retail services business losing a
supply contract. Annually the carrying values of all assets are reviewed for impairment, the loss of this supply contract resulted in an
impairment of $2.031m in the carrying value of goodwill.
Seeka ended the year with an excellent operational result and enters 2018 with a strong financial and operational outlook.

Highlights
• Profit after tax of $5.833m (2016: $10.385m), a decrease of 44%
(2016 comparative included the one-off after tax gain from insurance proceeds of $3.092m)
• Improved earnings from Seeka Australia with earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA) of NZD$2.251m (2016:
$1.029m), up 119%.
• Record low fruit loss to Seeka’s New Zealand kiwifruit growers of 1.18% for Hayward (green) conventional, 0.42% for Hayward
(green) organic growers and 0.73% for Zespri SunGold growers. Comparatively good results within the industry and specifically
the best Seeka has ever delivered.
• Successful completion of the New Zealand 2016/17 avocado selling season with Seeka handling a record 487,095 export trays
(2015/16: 225,656 export trays) delivering $24.85 per tray to growers (2016: $26.86). The forecast 2017/18 returns are in
excess of $40.00 per export tray.
• Successful and safe harvest seasons for all crops across Australia and New Zealand including kiwifruit, avocados, nashi, plums,
pears and cherries.
• Installation of a new $6.0m Compac Spectrim packing machine at Main Road Katikati that offers automated grading. Also the
relocation of the existing machine to the Peninsula packhouse to handle increases in the Coromandel-grown crop.
• Completion of the coolstore and pre-cooling capacity upgrades at Main Road, Katikati and at KKP and Transcool, Te Puke, an
investment in excess of $8.6m.
• Implementation of Seeka’s Australian orchard plan resulting in the development of 60 hectares of new kiwifruit orchard over the
next five years along with the introduction of exciting new pear varieties.
• Establishment and commissioning of the Delicious Nutritious Food Company delivering a first year earnings before interest, tax
and depreciation of $0.294m.
• Net debt (bank loans less bank deposits) totalled $83.121m (2016: $72.757m); an increase of $10.364m. Total assets increased
from $197.309m to $222.023m; an increase of $24.714m.

Dividend announcement
A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 23 March 2018 to
those shareholders on the register at 5pm, 16 March 2018. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply to the distribution. This dividend
will bring the total dividends distributed in the last 12 months to $0.22 (prior twelve months $0.20).

Outlook
Seeka is anticipating a return to average Hayward (green) kiwifruit yields along with a steady increase in the Zespri SunGold volumes. The
improvement programmes underway in Australia are expected to progressively improve earnings, and along with the anticipated increased
New Zealand avocado earnings and continuing development of the Delicious Nutritious Food Company give Seeka a positive earnings
outlook. Seeka is anticipating an improvement to earnings at an EBITDA level of between 5% and 10%.

1. Revenues reduced by $1.2m, and is made up of the increase of $2.9m ($2.1m after tax) for the grower incentive scheme, refer to note 3 and reduced by
$4.1m ($3.1m after tax) for insurance proceeds, refer to note 3. EBITDA was reduced by $1.6m and includes the above and also by $0.4m ($0.3m after tax)

Seeka annual report 2017

Review of operations
Revenue for the twelve months ended December 2017 totalled $186.814m (2016: $191.317m). The reduction reflects lower total New
Zealand kiwifruit volumes handled from 32.438m trays to 25.675m trays, a decline of 21%. Hayward (green) volume declined by 33%.
Consolidated earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) totalled $23.128m (2016: $24.764m); down 6.61%.
EBITDA from Seeka Australia totalled $2.251m (2016: $1.029m); up 119%.
Seeka implemented a number of innovations to minimise the impact of lower New Zealand kiwifruit volumes along with concentrating
on the Australian business, the avocado business and emerging business units including the establishment of the Delicious Nutritious
Food Company.
Consolidated profit after tax for the year totalled $5.833m (2016: $10.385m); down 43.8%. It should be noted that the 2016 result
includes $3.092m in after tax one-off insurance proceeds.
Cash flow from operations totalled $14.058m (2016: $21.252m); down largely due to the gross insurance proceeds of $3.627m
received in 2016.
Cash invested in property, plant and equipment totalled $20.870m (2016: $40.920m); down on the previous corresponding period
(pcp). Major capital expenditure items included the installation of a new Compac grader at Main Road and the relocation of the
previous Main Road machine to the Peninsula packhouse. Capital works also included the construction of coolstores and pre-coolers
at Main Road, KKP and Transcool along with the programme of converting wooden bins to plastic.
Seeka’s New Zealand coolstore infrastructure is now largely in balance with expected crop volumes and the next large project under
consideration is replacement of the packing machine at KKP to handle expected greater Zespri Sungold volumes in 2019.

Orchard operations in New Zealand
Activities include the servicing and growing of kiwifruit, kiwiberry and avocados through managed, leased and long term leased
arrangements. Orchard operations span from Northland through the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast.
Kiwifruit volumes decreased in 2017 following an industry-wide drop in green kiwifruit yields. For the 2017 kiwifruit harvest Seeka
grew 30.70m kilograms (8.45m trays) compared to 40.57m kilograms in 2016 (11.16m trays).
In addition Seeka grew 0.54m kilograms of avocados (98,356 trays) in the 2016/17 harvest (2015/16: 0.054m kilograms, 9,739 trays).
Seeka also grew 0.04m kilograms of kiwiberry (24,402 trays) for harvest 2017 (2016: 0.03m kilograms, 20,202 trays).
Seeka is actively investing in long term leases to replace those which have expired.
Total revenue for orchard operations for the year was $48.582m (2016: $47.889m). EBITDA of $6.376m (2016: $5.638m).

Post harvest operations in New Zealand
Coordinate the harvest, packing, storage and dispatch of kiwifruit, kiwiberry and avocados to the market, or in the case of Zespri
kiwifruit to the port.
In 2017 25.675m trays of New Zealand kiwifruit were packed (2016: 32.438m); a reduction of 6.724m trays being a direct effect of the
industry-wide fall in Hayward (green) yields.
Seeka delivered a safe and timely harvest to growers. The harvest was rain interrupted creating issues, however Seeka coordinated the
harvest to optimise fruit quality and minimise fruit loss. A new Compac Spectrim grader was built and commissioned at Main Road
with the previous machine relocated to the Peninsula packhouse in the Coromandel. New coolstores were built at Main Road, KKP and
Transcool.
Seeka innovated to mitigate the potential earnings impact of reduced volumes. Sensibly Seeka delayed capital expenditure and
implemented procurement reviews that successfully reduced costs. Importantly Seeka developed a new capacity planning tool, called
Blueprint. Blueprint has improved management’s ability to match expected harvested crop volumes with optimised plant utilisation
and coolstore capacity. It also ensures that a grower’s fruit receives an optimal harvest, and Seeka is able to optimise packing, cooling
and inventory management to minimise costs.

Fruit loss results were the best in Seeka’s history. Fruit loss statistics, a measure of post-harvest performance included 1.18% for
Hayward (green) conventional, 0.42% for Hayward (green) organic growers and 0.73% for Zespri SunGold growers.
Post-harvest revenue of $96.700m for the year is a reduction on the prior years $110.823m. EBITDA of $21.958m down on the prior
year $26.784m.

Retail services operations
Includes the supply and sale of avocados, class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, sale of New Zealand kiwifruit through approved
collaborative marketing programmes and imported tropical fruits.
Revenue totalled $24.294m, ahead of the prior year of $16.847m. EBITDA of $2.920m compares favourably against pcp of $1.941m.
Avocado earnings continue to grow in importance in this division’s revenue and earnings and the tray return to growers continues to
lead the Industry. Seeka expects the current year sales programme (2017:2018) to approach $40 per export tray – well surpassing the
previous record of $26.80. Seeka has gained a brand reputation for supreme quality throughout the customer base – with our retail
customers able to rely on a supply chain that delivers them high quality fruit every time.
The tropical business including banana importation and ripening has delivered positive earnings. A decision by a key customer to
rearrange their supply chain and source bananas direct from the market and only use Seeka for ripening has led Seeka to impair the
goodwill associated with its sourcing contract by $2.031m.
Seeka has established a new business, the Delicious Nutritious Food Company as a wholly owned subsidiary. The business manufactures and
markets a range of kiwi crush products, manufactures and supplies avocado oil and will include the packing and distribution of kiwiberry. The
combined operations deliver a full year business cycle. EBITDA for the partial first year of manufacturing totalled $0.294m and is included in the
overall EBITDA for retail services.

Seeka Australia PTY Limited
Owns and operates predominately kiwifruit, nashi and pear orchards, packing and logistics infrastructure. The company markets
directly to retailers and wholesale markets for both Australian and New Zealand-grown fruit.
2017 kiwifruit harvest yields and quality were better than 2016 while nashi volumes were below expectation. Across all varieties Seeka
is concentrating on quality as well as increasing yields. 2017 volumes by variety are outlined in the following table with comparatives.

Seeka has concentrated on upgrading the orchards, post-harvest infrastructure, safety and business systems and the general
presentation of the business in Australia.
Seeka is further expanding its kiwifruit plantations with infill planting of existing orchards and the development of new orchards.
The company has some 60 hectares of new kiwifruit orchards in development and purchased land adjacent to its existing orchards
for further development. Developments will take three to five years to bear fruit, but Seeka is confident in both the orchards and
Australian business.

Seeka annual report 2017

Long range business planning has set AUD$8m as the targeted EBITDA for this business operation. Innovation includes new variety
trials which are underway. Seeka is introducing new hybrid pear varieties to replace some commodity pears on its orchard.
The Australian team is focused on improving the presentation and quality of fruit sold to market. Goulburn Valley is a highly regarded
fruit growing region in Australia with a hot climate, high sunshine hours and low rainfall. Fruit grown in this environment has high dry
matter and great taste and is well received by the market as confirmed by independent consumer studies.
Seeka is actively investing in its Australian business as a future growth platform establishing new orchards and introducing new varieties.
The quality of fruit grown in Australia, relatively low cost of establishment, established infrastructure and high value close domestic market
provides confidence in the investment programme.
EBITDA of $2.251m is a significant improvement on prior year EBITDA of $1.029m.

The Seeka team
Inspirational people is a hallmark of our brand and we have focused on our people development strategy to ensure that Seeka is well
resourced for the future.
Seeka is committed to the success of our people and has invested in the future by establishing a number of programmes. During the year
Seeka established a leadership development programme to ensure that the future leaders are fully equipped to continue the success and
growth of Seeka. Orchard cadetships are available for those looking to begin a career in horticulture and are exposed to the full remit of
orchard management and can go on to become trainee managers. Seeka has been collaborating with Te Awanui Kiwi Leaders initiative to
establish a fully-mentored cadet programme. Seeka also offers an overseas experience programme to selected employees.
The company has refined its health and safety strategy and systems to ensure that it complies with legislation and keeps its people,
contractors and stakeholders safe. Established key performance measures including Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR),
Notifiable Injuries, Notifiable Incidents and Severity Rate (average days lost from injury) as key performance indicators for the
company. The key performance indicators set with management staff include these key components.
The 2017 actual results and 2018 targets are shown in the following table below.

Safety systems continue to be refined and actively managed to ensure our people are safe. The Company is continuing to make
excellent progress with its health and safety strategy and deployment. Further Seeka continues to invest in training and systems,
to ensure contractor compliance. Non-compliant contractors are removed from the approved Company supplier list. Generally
contractors have worked cooperatively with Seeka to achieve compliance and Seeka is satisfied with the compliance of its contractor
community.
Seeka also has a team of dedicated employees to source and care for its seasonal workforce. This includes the overseas workforce recruited
under the RSE scheme which compliments the local New Zealand workforce. Our team ensures that we make all endeavours to employ New
Zealanders first, including working with the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment on innovative schemes. These schemes include
transport arrangements, training courses and innovative incentives to bring regional people to Seeka’s employment hubs.

1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of
hours worked. TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
2. Severity rate = (number of lost time injuries) / (number of days lost).

11

Seeka360 Campus
Te Arikinui Kiingi Tuheitia opened Seeka’s new headquarters in March 2017. The building and campus is utilised by Seeka, its growers,
and community.
Progress is being made to address the deferred maintenance on the property and develop a commercial GEM avocado orchard to both
showcase this variety and generate income from the previous amenity property.
Seeka is now planning on relocating its laboratory operations from Te Puke to the Seeka360 hub to further create this produce centre
of excellence.

Innovation
Seeka continues to invest in innovation to support operations, fruit performance, automation and operational efficiency.
More recent innovations include information systems deployed by Seeka enabling faster decisions to be made at critical moments
in the business cycle. Inventory managers are able to assess fruit in all stores, understand atmospheric conditions and fruit
characteristics to prioritise fruit for optimal shipment to the market.
Information systems have been deployed to improve planning in increasingly complex situations. Blueprint, Seeka’s innovation to the
harvest of multiple varieties, maturities and sites, is now deployed in the business to improve operational efficiency.
Seeka’s laboratory business, VLS, has continued to innovate to support growers and the business. Seeka has recently been awarded a
contract to supply the kiwifruit industry with independent maturity testing services from 2018 – a highlight for Seeka.

Summary
Reduced New Zealand kiwifruit volumes primarily resulting from an industry-wide lower Hayward yield impacted negatively on
Seeka’s earnings. The company responded to this challenge positively and innovated to mitigate the impact. Australian operations and
Seeka avocados delivered improved earnings and the emerging Delicious Nutritious Food Company is now fully operational. Changes
in the supply arrangements of a key customer led Seeka to impair the goodwill in its banana sourcing business.
Seeka is constantly using innovative technological developments in the core kiwifruit business to optimise packhouse operations and
deliver continuous improvement in performance to growers plus minimise cost to the company.
Seeka would like to thank all stakeholders for their continued support and all growers who supply Seeka for choosing Seeka as their
preferred supply partner.
Seeka is well placed through the quality and focus of our people, our strategic investments in orchards and post harvest facilities, the
broadening of our retail services business and the support of our shareholders.

Basis of preparation
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements. Accounting policies
which are limited to a specific note, are described in that note.

Reporting entity and statutory base

Foreign currency transactions

The financial statements presented are those of the consolidated
Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as the Company. The group is
referred to as the Group, Seeka, or Seeka Group.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing during the month of
that transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income
statement.

Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New
Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets
Conduct (FMC) Reporting Entity for the purposes of the FMC Act
2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the
NZX main board equity security market (NZX Main Board).

Nature of operations
Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
In New Zealand the Group provides orcharding, post harvest and retail
services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry industries.
Seeka manufactures and sells the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies ranges
along with avocado oil. The Group also provides retail and ripening
services for imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale
market.
In Australia, Seeka owns and operates orchards and associated post
harvest assets, making the Group the largest producer and supplier
of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of European
pears, plus lesser production of other temperate-climate fruits.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the FMC
Act 2013. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),
incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other applicable financial
reporting standards as appropriate for profit-oriented entities. The
Group financial statements also comply with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with
the exception of:
• financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at
fair value through the profit or loss (note 28 and 29)
• biological assets - crop at fair value (note 11)
• land and buildings are revalued (note 9)
• water shares at fair value (note 10)
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
financial statements are set out below.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the
Board) on 23 February 2018.

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intragroup balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting
from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on
transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
20

Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of
which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the
Group are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance
sheet;
• Income and expenses for each entity's income statement and
statement of other comprehensive income, are translated at
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other
comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.
Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used
and are relevant to the understanding of the financial statements
are provided throughout the accompanying notes. The accounting
policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the
periods presented in these financial statements, with the exception of
a change in measurement basis for water shares in 2017. The water
shares, an intangible asset, have been revalued to fair value from cost
to better reflect the true value of the shares and align them with other
shares held by the Group (note 29). Certain comparative information
has been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that
have been issued and effective, that are expected to have a significant
impact on the Group (note 30).

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future
operational and financial performance. By definition, these
assumptions may not always equal actual results. The estimates
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are
identified in the notes below. Estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as
adjusted for current market conditions and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Assumptions underlying management’s estimates
can be found in the following notes to the financial statements.

Going concern assumption
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis.

Goods and services tax (GST)
The statement of financial performance and statement of
comprehensive income has been prepared so that all components are
stated exclusive of GST. All items in the statement of financial position
are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables,
which include GST invoiced.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating
segments.

Note 1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in business
activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a
manner consistent with the internal reports provided to the chief
decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the
allocation of resources alongside operational outcomes and are
responsible for implementing strategic decisions.
The Group has five operating segments:
• Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary
services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the
retail sector.
• A single Australian segment encompasses the integrated business
associated with the Group’s Australian-grown produce.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each
segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs and
insurance proceeds recorded in the statement of financial performance
are allocated to all other segments. Transactions between segments
are conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated on consolidation.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations
The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.

Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and
internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This
includes fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post
harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported fruit produce, and operates a wholesale
market.
Following the Group's purchase of the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies
product ranges in September 2016, retail service operations include
the production and selling of Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies to hospitals
and the retail sector. Avocado oil is sold to the wholesale and retail
sectors.

All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower
services and overhead sections along with insurance proceeds
recorded in the statement of financial performance and impairment
and revaluations of other assets not attributed directly to any other
segment.

Australian operations
The Group owns and operates Australian orchards, provides post
harvest operations and markets the fruit produced from those
orchards, primarily in Australia. The main products are kiwifruit, nashi
pears and European pears.

The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
• Leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts) whereby
the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the orchard
owners.
• Leased land (long term contracts) which the Group has developed
into productive orchards, pays all development and production
costs, owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit
with the landowner after all costs are recovered.

Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado and
kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the Group’s orchard
management and lease operations, plus crops from independent
orchard owners.

Turnover
Turnover (a non-GAAP measure) includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers where the Group acts as the agent, and
is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. (See note 2).

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax. EBIT is an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

Note 2. Turnover
The following table reconciles turnover to revenue.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

In the second half of 2016 the Group entered a direct buying arrangement for the importation and supply of bananas in New Zealand whereby
total revenues and expenses are reported in the statement of financial performance. Previously the Group had imported bananas on an agency
arrangement whereby the Group only reported commission revenue.

Total revenue and other income
The three year grower incentive scheme ended 31 December 2016.
Revenue in 2016 is shown net of discounts and included $2.93m for
the cost of the grower incentive scheme.

Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations,
with post harvest revenues recognised as services are provided
and orchard revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail
revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New Zealand kiwifruit
are harvested from March to June, avocados from August to January,
and kiwiberries from February to March. In Australia nashi and
European pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit from
March to May. As a result of these harvest timings around 80% of
orchard revenues are recognised in the first six months of the financial
year. The timing of the provision of post harvest services can vary from
year to year. Normally 70% is recognised in the first six months of the
financial year, but seasonal fluctuations can alter this.

Oakside fire - insurance proceeds for asset loss
On 4 March 2015 a fire at the Group's Oakside facility destroyed an
ancillary packhouse and caused damage to an office space and a
number of coolstore buildings and associated plant, all part of post
harvest operations. The Group was fully insured for loss on assets
and also business interruption. During the 2016 financial year the
value of the property claim was finalised with the exception of some
aspects of the business interruption policy. In the current financial
year $0.13m was received from insurance proceeds and recorded in
the statement of financial performance. In the 2016 financial year
$0.50m was recorded in the statement of financial performance and
$5.46m recorded in the 2015 financial year. In addition to the property
and business interruption insurance receipts recorded in the 2016
statement of financial performance, a further $3.63m receipt was
recorded for the settlement of the loss suffered by growers and Seeka
due to extraordinary fruit softening and fruit loss as a result of the
Oakside fire.

23

Accounting policies
Revenue comprises the fair value received for the sale of goods and
services, net of goods and services tax (GST), rebates and discounts
and after eliminating sales within the Group.

Fruit marketing and wholesale market sales programmes (domestic
and international) where the Group acts as an agent and collects a
commission on sales - revenue is recognised when the produce is sold.

Orchard revenue

Where the Group purchases fruit directly from suppliers for resale revenue is recognised when the produce is sold.

Managed orchards - revenue is invoiced and recognised as earned for
orcharding services provided to managed orchards supplying the Group.
Leased orchards and leased land orchards - crop revenue is recognised
in the statement of financial performance at the point of harvest
based on forecast orchard gate returns (OGRs) with a corresponding
increase in the statement of financial position. The proceeds are
then received over the 12 month period following harvest. Revenue
estimates are updated at balance date.

Post harvest revenue
Revenue is generated from fruit packing, coolstorage and other supplychain activities. Services peak from April to December with the bulk of
revenues collected by the end of November. Revenue is recognised as
services are provided.

Retail service revenue
Ripening and delivery services, and fruit sales to key retail customers revenue is recognised as services are provided on a principal or agency
basis depending on who bears the risks and rewards.

Collaborative marketing programmes (the Group purchases fruit from
Zespri International for sale in agreed international markets under
licence from Kiwifruit New Zealand) - revenue is recognised when the
produce is sold.
Where the Group manufactures and sells products, including the Kiwi
Crush, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil range of products - revenue is
recognised when the products are sold.

Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the
effective interest method.

Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.

Accounting policies
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of financial
performance as incurred, except where future economic benefits arise
and they are recorded as a prepayment.

Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of
ownership are retained by the Group are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and
annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting
date, are recognised in other payables in respect of employees'
services up to the reporting date and are measured at the amounts
expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Liabilities for nonaccumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and
measured at the rates paid or payable.

Operating leases include short term orchard leases. Payments made
under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor)
are charged to the statement of financial performance on a straight
line basis over the period of the lease, except for short term orchard
leases where lease costs are recognised at the same time as other
crop related income and expenses.

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is
recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date, and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing
for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit.
26

Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly
controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be
applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2016 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.

Note 8. Events occurring after balance date
There are no material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

Seeka annual report 2017

Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a
three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for
buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung
Valuers, ANZIV, independent registered valuer. In Australia valuations
are undertaken by Goulburn Valley Property Services, independent
valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. Australia land and buildings
were revalued at 31 December 2017.
Valuations are undertaken by the independent valuers using inherently
subjective techniques that include estimations.
The valuers consider four different approaches in concert to arrive at
a fair value;
1. Direct replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the
replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements based
on the current cost of construction less depreciation based on the

age of the building with an allowance for physical depreciation.
Specific consideration is given to the 'optimised depreciated
replacement cost' methodology.
2. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.
3. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the
property with a current market rental being established and
capitalising this at an appropriate rate of return (8.75% – 11.5%)
that would be expected by a prudent investor.
4. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method
whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the
investment method and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year
period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market
rentals and estimated costs incurred to maintain land and buildings
in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are
sold in the terminal year (year 11).

The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax of $3.98m (2016: $1.94m).

Impairment
During the year the Group replaced some of its Australian bearer plants as part of a plant and crop renewal plan. This resulted in an impairment
and the write off of the carrying value of bearer plants replaced by $0.10m (Dec 2016 - $0.12m) which was recognised in the statement of
financial performance.

Accounting policies
Bearer plants
Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear,
avocado and other fruiting trees on Group-owned and leased land.
Bearer plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical
cost includes all costs incurred to purchase or establish the asset.

Land and buildings
Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at
least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any subsequent
improvements at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. At
each annual balance date, approximately one third of assets classified as
land and buildings are revalued and those valuations are used to assess
the appropriateness of the carrying values of all land and building assets
held by the Group, which effectively revalues all land and buildings
annually. Revaluations are performed more frequently if changing
industry conditions may cause their carrying value to differ significantly
from fair value. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation
is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net
amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and
buildings are accounted through comprehensive income and other
reserves, except where an asset's fair value is less than the original
cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of
financial performance.

Plant, equipment and vehicles
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical
cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to
purchase the asset.
Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All
other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of financial
performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Impairment of assets are recognised in the statement of financial
performance.

29

Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.

• Bearer plants: 5 - 50 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted
if appropriate, at balance date.
An asset’s carrying amount is immediately written down to its
recoverable amount.

The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is included in the
statement of financial performance. When revalued assets are sold, the
amounts included in the revaluation reserve in respect of those assets
is transferred to retained earnings.

• Buildings: 20 - 50 years
• Machinery: 10 - 20 years
• Vehicles: 4 - 7 years
• Furniture, fittings and equipment: 3 - 10 years

The amortisation period of software is four to five years and the
remaining amortisation period for the interest in leased land is from
33 to 91 years.
The Group's interest in leased land occupied, or held for future
development, arose on the acquisition of Huka Pak and is the
difference in the value of the lease terms to relative market terms.

Water shares are an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure
required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual crops in Australia
and are carried at fair value based on the closing water share market
price. This is the first year the water shares are being valued at fair
value. Previously they were recognised at cost; see the basis of
consolidation section for the change in accounting policies.

Impairment tests for goodwill
The Board reviews business performance based on operating
segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level in
accordance with the policy below. Goodwill represents the Group's
retail services acquired with Glassfields, the acquisition of Seeka
Australia (Pty) Limited and the acquisition of the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi
Crushies product ranges.
Following a major customer moving to their own direct supply of
bananas, the Board reviewed and impaired the carrying value of the
goodwill associated with Glassfields' banana business by $2.03m.

The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the
five-year after-tax cash flow projection, with a terminal value beyond
five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated
using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated below. The
assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast
gross margin for the cash generating unit, is determined based on
past performance and the Board's expectations of future market
development.
No other impairment arose in the current year.

The following table details the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations and the recoverable amount in 2017.

Accounting policies
Intangible assets

Goodwill acquired in business combinations is not amortised. Instead,
goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if
deemed prudent, with goodwill carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to that entity.

Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and
amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite life
are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually
for impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. When assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able to
generate cash flow.

Water shares

Software

Supplier contracts

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Internally developed computer software is capitalised when it enters
the development phase per NZ IAS 38 on the basis of costs incurred to
develop and test the software for use. Intangible assets are amortised
over their estimated useful life (typically three to five years).

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the
acquired business or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on
acquisition of a business is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on
acquisition of an associate is included in investments in associates.

The Group records permanent water shares at fair value based on the
market price at balance date. The shares are fully tradeable and have
an indefinite life and are not depreciated.
When an intangible asset is recognised on a supplier contract it is
amortised over the life of the contract on a straight line basis. The
expense is charged to the statement of financial performance.

Lease interest in land
The Group’s interest in long term leased land occupied, or held for
future development, is amortised over the life of the lease and tested
for impairment on a triennial basis along with land and buildings.

Other intangibles
Other intangibles include a licence to grow G3 kiwifruit and is
amortised over the life of the licence on a straight line basis. The
expense is charged to the statement of financial performance.

31

Note 11. Biological assets - crop
Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
Crop assets are kiwifruit, Nashi pears, Packham Pears, Corella Pears, other pears, cherries, avocado, apricot, and plum crops growing on leased
and owned orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.

New Zealand dollars

The following table details the classification of biological assets - crop.

Carrying value at end of period

Crop where cost is deemed fair value
Kiwifruit, Nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date and as
such cost is deemed fair value (note 27).
For each crop cost is tested for impairment at balance date using the Group budget for yields and market returns less costs yet to be incurred on
an orchard-by-orchard basis to establish a recoverable value for the crop on each of the Group's orchards.
Where the recoverable value is less than cost, the cost is impaired through the statement of financial performance.

Accounting policies
Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair value depends
on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (provided the costs
are considered recoverable).
When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.
The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference to current and expected sales returns when available. When market data
is not available an assessment is made based on historical data.

Within current trade receivables, $1.10m are past due (Dec 2016 - $1.14m), of which 3.5% are more than 90 days (Dec 2016 - 5%). Non-current trade
receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up to five years.

Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be
able to collect all amounts due and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect the term
portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates via the use of derivatives. See note 28.

Seeka annual report 2017

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Issue of shares under the employee share scheme

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the number of fully
paid shares held.

Grower incentive scheme
On 7 September 2016, the Group issued 666,124 shares at a price of $4.40 each in respect of the 2016 kiwifruit supply season to participating
growers. No shares were issued in 2017.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the period.

Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

Share based payment reserve
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan established in 2016.
The active scheme is managed by a trust established October 2014, and the directors of the trustee company (Seeka Employee Share Plan Trustee
Limited) are also directors of Seeka.
Under the employee share schemes shares are issued to an employee share trust, with certain employees eligible to subscribe to shares held by
the trust with this benefit recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the
vesting period the employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to them, alternatively the
employee can elect not to have the shares transferred to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees.

Balance 31 December

At balance date, the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted to employees and remain outstanding under the scheme
was 435,800 (Dec 2016 - 743,600), representing 2.51% (Dec 2016 - 4.43%) of the shares of the Company on issue at that date.
The shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust.
The shares held by the employee share scheme carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares. While monies are owed on the
shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the scheme is valued using a Black Scholes pricing model. Because the Company has a small market capitalisation with
minimal trading, volatility is forecasted into the model.
During the year the shares issued in 2014 vested with employees, with all but 77,500 shares transferred to employees. The remaining shares are
held by the trust for payment over two years with interest charged on the outstanding loan balance.

Accounting policies
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for
the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement
of financial performance with a corresponding increase in the share
based payment reserve. The fair value is determined by reference
to the fair value of the options granted, calculated using the Black
Scholes pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those
shares is transferred to retained earnings.
Shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set by
the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
calculation of the Company's shares during the period prior to issue.
The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with further
shares if that issue would result in the ESS having an interest of more
than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.

Dividends paid

Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme
trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the
debt between the ESS and the Group on behalf of the employee.
Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited
to share capital when the options are exercised.
ESS has a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated to
employees. Annually the Group reviews the scheme and decides upon
the allocation of further shares and the price at which those shares will
be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS are appointed for an unspecified
term and may be removed by the Company at any time.
Shares held by the ESS carry the same voting rights as other issued
ordinary shares.

Purchase of shares in Rising Sun Orchards Limited
In October 2017 the Group purchased a 16.67% share in Rising Sun Orchards Limited; a company that purchased and operates a 28 canopy
hectare avocado orchard in Houhora, Northland, New Zealand.

Impairment of investment
The Group owns 32% of UPNZ Limited (UPNZ). During the 2016 financial year the Group fully impaired its $0.34m investment in UPNZ. UPNZ
imports plastic pocket packs from China and Chile and distributes them to the New Zealand kiwifruit industry. In late March 2016, a visual
inspection found grease deposits on several packs supplied by UPNZ. As a consequence Zespri Group Limited (Zespri) placed all kiwifruit packed
into UPNZ pocket packs sourced from China on hold until they could determine whether the grease posed any potential food safety issues. UPNZ
was forced to recall this product and as a result its customers, including Seeka, suffered costs checking the packed kiwifruit inventory to remove
all affected trays. The Board believes this will have a major impact on the value of the Group's investment in UPNZ and it was recognised as an
impairment in the statement of financial performance. No impairment was recognised in 2017.

Accounting policies
The fair values of the listed securities are based on the securities' closing share price at balance date. Where pricing information is available,
unlisted securities are revalued at balance date. All other unlisted securities are currently held at cost less impairment as it reasonably represents
current fair value. The carrying amount of all unlisted securities have been reviewed at balance date and any impairment is recognised through the
statement of comprehensive income to the extent of any related reserve available and then through the statement of financial performance.

Note 26. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to
producing and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate
financial risks related to credit, liquidity and capital risk. The Group
operates a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation programme
via its audit and risk committee.
The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value
and maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources are
available for the development of the Group’s business whilst managing
its financial risks.

a. Risk management strategies related to orchard and
retail operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production and
market returns. The main production risks are climatic events, diseases
and pests. These impact on volumes produced from the Group's
orchards, volumes to post harvest (both from Group operations and
independent growers) and volumes available for retail.
Market risks of pricing and exchange rates impact on orchard
operations (the amount the Group is paid for growing crops) and
impact on retail revenues where the Group imports and sells fruit
produce, mainly bananas. The exchange rate risk on imports is
managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts to match
known and planned purchases. Market risks do not directly impact on
post harvest operations, as charges are normally set prior to harvest
and deducted before sales revenues are paid to supplying growers.
The Group operates in four regions spread over two countries; New
Zealand's Northland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty, and in
Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce lines are
kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears and avocados, with small
production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail activities
are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce), Australia
and Asia. The Group's geographical, product and market spread limits
the impact on Group operations from an adverse event occurring in a
specific region, produce or market. To further mitigate risks, the Board
uses the following strategies.

Production risks - climatic events, disease and pests
The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production risks.
This includes orchard management practices to optimise production
from Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure post harvest
and retail services are suitably resourced to manage each season's
crop volumes.
In New Zealand, the major climatic risks are hail, frost and storm
damage.
• Hail events are typically highly localised, and for kiwifruit the
Group has access to industry hail insurance for its orchard
operations, plus top-up payments from a Seeka Growers Limited
hail insurance programme.
• Frost events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including active frost management
on kiwifruit orchards operated by the Group and other growers
supplying the Group's post harvest operations.
• Storm events are typically regional, and the Group advocates bestpractice crop protection, including shelter belts on all orchards
operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's
post harvest operations.
In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As the
owner and operator of all orchards supplying its Australian operations,
the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total production base.
The orchards are located on three sites in the Mundoona region.
• Drought events are typically regional, and to secure adequate
irrigation, the Group has purchased extensive, long-term water
shares from a reliable irrigation programme.

• Hail events are typically localised, and the Group currently has hail
cloth protecting one orchard.
• Fire risk is typically from serious grass wild-fire occuring during
periods of extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority
responsible for risk assessment and management of fire events.
The Group takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk
including removing excess vegetation from Group properties.
All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest
incursions. The kiwifruit vine disease Pseudomonas syringae pv.
actinidiae (Psa) is widespread throughout New Zealand, and is being
actively managed. To date Psa has not been detected in Australia.
The brown marmorated stink bug is also a potential threat to the
horticulture industry. To minimise the risk of crop loss the Group
monitors its orchards and undertakes recognised spray programmes
to protect crops to the fullest extent possible. Seeka also relies on the
Ministry for Primary Industries to protect New Zealand's borders from
introduced diseases.

Market returns
New Zealand kiwifruit
The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit
harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing activities
are undertaken by Zespri Group Limited (Zespri) under statutory
regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the level of Zespri's
market returns which impact on the Group's orchard profitability.
The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling techniques
to analyse current and projected orchard income. This information is
used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.
New Zealand avocados and kiwiberries
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocados and
kiwiberries, with half of kiwiberry sales and all avocado sales managed
by the Group's retail operations. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns. This information is used when
setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.
The Group has no direct currency risk from export sales as it does not
own the products but acts as the growers’ agent.
Imported tropical produce
The Group has a direct market, price and currency risk from imported
fruit produce (banana, pineapple and papaya) where the Group
imports fruit produce for sale as the principal through its supply
and sale contracts. The Group may hedge up to the total known and
projected cash flows to manage exchange risk. The Group has no
material direct price and currency risk from imported fruit produce
where the supply agreement enables the Group to amend its purchase
price according to trading conditions.
Australian produce
The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all
Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian
operations. As the largest single grower and supplier of Australian
kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong
relationships with key retailers. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns.
Seeka Australia is the Group’s single major international operation,
exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk
includes future commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net
investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed through
borrowings in Australian dollars.

43

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
customers, including outstanding receivables, derivative financial
instruments and committed transactions.

For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their
subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require any
collateral or security to support financial instruments due to the
quality of the financial institutions.

The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if
counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The Group's
maximum exposure is:

For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals
predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post
harvest services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is
therefore not considered significant.

• the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets
as stated in the consolidated statement of financial position, and
• the amount of contingent liabilities, if any, in relation to the
financial guarantees provided by the Group.

Other than concentration of credit risk on liquid funds deposited with
one bank with a high credit rating, the Group does not have any other
significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables are spread
over approximately 400 customers.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure
that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity
requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.
When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.
At balance date, the Group had $116.2m (2016 - $114.8m) of available credit of which $85.5m (2016 - $74.4m) was drawn. All credit lines are
currently provided by one finance provider.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling
assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings times
interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants. Refer to note 15.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified on the statement of financial position either
as investment in shares and water shares within intangible assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities,
only some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity
reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The decision to change the fair value of an investment is recorded through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial performance
whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance was available. When no such reserve existed, any related loss is processed directly in the
statement of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.
The following table details interest rate and price sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their impact on the
statement of financial performance or equity. Cash and advance balances do not attract interest and are not subject to pricing risk,
and are therefore excluded from this analysis.

Note 27. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
The different levels are defined as:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited and water shares.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
• Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
when determining an appropriate price.

Accounting policies
Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be
estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes. Fair value measurements are categorised into a three-level
hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation techniques
used.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such
as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and investment in shares)
is based on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The
quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the
current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial
liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active
market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined
using valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses the
appropriate method and makes assumptions that are based on market
conditions at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer
quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments

held. The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows. Other techniques, such as
estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for
the remaining financial instruments.

Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade
receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values
due to their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and
liabilities with unobservable (level 3 inputs) reflect the assumptions
that market participants would use when determining an appropriate
price; additional disclosure is provided for the inputs and assumptions
used in such cases.

Land and buildings and interest in leased land
Fair value is based on an annual revaluation, which is performed
on land and buildings based on a rolling three-year cycle by an
independent valuer, with approximately one third of land and buildings
assets valued each year using four different approaches as described
in note 9.

Interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange contracts - cash flow hedge

Group bank loans currently bear an average variable interest rate of 3.7% (Dec 2016 – 3.5%), with the Group using interest rate swaps to protect
the term portion of the loans.
Swaps cover 58% (Dec 2016 - 64%) of the term liabilities at balance date and are classified as held for trading or as cash flow hedges.

Accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments and hedging

Cash flow hedge

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their
fair value at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised
as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative
is designated and effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the
hedge relationship. Derivatives are classified as current or non-current
based on the effective date.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge
relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,
exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging
instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time
remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement
of financial performance. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported
in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the
statement of financial performance within other gains / (losses).

Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At
the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.

48

Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation
technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are
applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are based
on quoted market rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by
Westpac.

Accounting policies
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: loans
and receivables, assets at fair value through reserves, and available
for sale financial assets. Classification depends on the purpose for
which the investments were acquired. The Group determines the
classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates
this designation at each balance date.

Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs
for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash
flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred
and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership.

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised when
the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are
initially recognised at cost plus transaction costs for all financial assets
not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried
at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value,
and transaction costs are expensed in the statement of financial
performance. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to
receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and
rewards of ownership. Available for sale financial assets and financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at
fair value.

Available for sale financial assets are valued at fair value through
profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and
receivables and held to maturity investments are carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. Realised and unrealised
gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the
statement of financial performance in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of
non-monetary securities classified as available for sale are recognised
in other comprehensive income in the available for sale investments
revaluation reserve. However, if the loss is deemed to represent
objective evidence of an impairment, any additional loss over and
above previous gains recognised in reserves will be recognised in the
statement of financial performance. When securities classified as
available for sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments are
included in the statement of financial performance as gains and losses
from investment securities.

Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly
to a debtor with no intention of selling the receivable. Loans and
receivables are included in receivables in the statement of financial
position.

Assets at fair value through reserves
Assets at fair value through reserves are financial assets which are
quoted in an active market. Increases in the fair value of the asset
are recognised through reserves in the statement of equity. Any
decreases in the fair value will first reduce from the amount held in the
reserve account and further decreases will then be recognised in the
statement of financial performance. They are included in non-current
assets unless the Group intends to sell the asset within 12 months of
balance date.

Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable
equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either designated in
this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are
included in non-current assets unless the Group intends to dispose of
the investment within 12 months of balance date.
Available for sale financial assets are recognised on trade date or the
date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

50

The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid
prices. If the market for a financial asset or unlisted security is not
active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include reference to the fair values of recent arm’s length
transactions, involving the same instruments or other instruments that
are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option
pricing models refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances.

Impairment of financial assets
At balance date the Group assesses whether there is objective
evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available for
sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a security
below its cost is considered in determining whether the security is
impaired. If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial
assets, the cumulative loss, as measured as the difference between
the acquisition cost and the current fair value less any impairment
loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit and loss,
is removed from equity and recognised in the statement of financial
performance. Impairment losses on equity instruments recognised in
the statement of financial performance are not reversed through other
comprehensive income.

Note 30. Application of new and revised New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective
The Group has not early adopted the following new and revised standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet
effective. The Group is assessing the impacts of the new standards as below:
NZ IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). NZ IFRS 15
addresses recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.
It replaces the current revenue recognition guidance in NZ IAS 18
Revenue and NZ IAS 11 Construction contracts and is applicable to
all entities with revenue. It sets out a five-step model for revenue
recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Group has established a process to review its sources of revenue,
but has yet to assess the full impact of NZ IFRS 15.
The vast majority of the Group’s revenue is represented by
transactions that have been settled in cash within the financial year,
and for this reason the recognition guidance within NZ IFRS 15 is not
anticipated to have a significant impact on the Group’s annual financial
statements. The Group is considering the impacts on their interim
reporting where due to the seasonal nature of the Group’s business
there is anticipated to be a larger impact upon adoption of NZ IFRS 15.
The Group will apply this standard from 1 January 2018.
NZ IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’instruments’ (effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). NZ IFRS 9 is to replace
IAS 39 and will simplify the mixed measurement model as well as
establish three primary measurement categories for financial assets:
amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through profit and
loss. Basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and
contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. IAS 39 guidance on
impairment and hedge accounting will continue to apply. The Group
has updated the existing hedge documentation to ensure that hedge
accounting will continue to be applicable when applying NZ IFRS 9.
The Group is in the process of assessing other impacts of the adoption
of NZ IFRS 9 including the application of the expected credit losses
model to trade and other receivables.

NZ IFRS 16 'Leases' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2019). NZ IFRS 16 replaces the current guidance in NZ IAS
17. Under NZ IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period
of time in exchange for consideration. Under NZ IAS 17, a lessee was
required to make a distinction between a finance lease (on balance
sheet) and an operating lease (off balance sheet). NZ IFRS 16 now
requires a lessee to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease
payments and a ‘right-of-use asset’ for virtually all lease contracts.
Included is an optional exemption for certain short-term leases and
leases of low-value assets; however, this exemption can only be
applied by lessees.
For lessors, the accounting for leases under NZ IFRS 16 is almost the
same as NZ IAS 17. However, because the guidance on the definition of
a lease has been updated (as well as the guidance on the combination
and separation of contracts), lessors will also be affected by the new
standard.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted but only in conjunction
with NZ IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers'. The
Group intends to adopt NZ IFRS 16 on its effective date and has begun
a process to review its operating leases; the Group’s existing lease
commitments are set out in note 24. The Group is in the process
of gathering all required information in order to calculate the lease
liability and right-of-use assets. The Group’s expectation is that the
variable lease payments on orchard leases which are contingent on the
number of trays harvested will not be included in the calculation of the
Group’s lease liability upon adoption of NZ IFRS 16.

Independent auditor’s report
To the shareholders of Seeka Limited
The consolidated financial statements comprise:


the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017;



the statement of financial performance for the year then ended;



the statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;



the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;



the statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and



the notes to the financial statements, which include significant accounting policies.

Our opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company), including its
subsidiaries (the Group), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as
at 31 December 2017, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS)
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs
NZ) and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (Revised)
Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (PES 1) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements.
Our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of tax services and remuneration
benchmarking. The provision of these other services has not impaired our independence as auditor of
the Group.

Our audit approach
Overview
An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
Overall group materiality: $1.9 million, which approximates 1% of
Group revenue.
We selected 1% of revenue as the benchmark for our materiality as we
consider this is an appropriate measure of performance of the Group.
The Group operates in a high volume low margin industry where net
profit is not representative of the scale of the Group.
Key Audit Matters
 Valuation of Biological Assets – crop
 Valuation of Land and Buildings

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out
above. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit,
the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both
individually and in aggregate on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Audit scope
We designed our audit by assessing the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial
statements and our application of materiality. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of
management override of internal controls including among other matters, consideration of whether
there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
We audited both the New Zealand and Australian operations of the Group at a materiality level
calculated by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the
business concerned or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes where the
statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit
matter

Valuation of Biological Assets - crop

Our audit focused on the biological assets valued at cost, being
the most significant component of the balance. We have
evaluated judgements applied by management to determine
the crop value including the degree of biological
transformation, the attribution of costs capitalised to the
following year’s crop and the recoverability of capitalised costs.

The total value of biological assets at balance date was
$16.7 million. Biological assets are disclosed in note 11 of
the financial statements and comprise the crops on the
vines and trees in the Group’s leased and owned orchards.
Biological assets are recorded at fair value. The method to
determine fair value depends on the degree of biological
transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
As at 31 December 2017, a total of $16.5 million (99%) of
biological assets used cost as a proxy for fair value.
In determining the fair value of the biological assets,
management exercises judgement utilising industry
knowledge and internal experts in determining the level of
biological transformation at balance date. When
insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair
value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the
crops (provided the costs are considered recoverable).
For those biological assets where cost has been used as a
proxy for fair value, management assessed the
recoverability of capitalised costs by comparing the
carrying amount to budgeted costs at year end and
ensuring that actual costs incurred plus costs to be
incurred in order to get the crop to market did not exceed
budgeted revenues from the sale of the crops. Management
uses historical results and anticipated crop levels as a basis
for budgeted revenues. An impairment is recognised when
the actual costs incurred plus costs to be incurred in order
to get the crop to market exceed budgeted revenues.

Our audit procedures included:
-

Gaining an understanding of the crop life cycle and
growth periods with reference to relevant
independent horticultural industry information to
determine the appropriateness of management’s
assessment of biological transformation.

-

Selecting a sample of expenses that were capitalised
to determine whether capitalisation was valid and
directly related to the unharvested crop at 31
December 2017.

-

Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models
used by management in their calculation of the fair
value of the crops.

-

Reviewing management’s assessment of the
recoverability of capitalised costs. Our procedures
included comparing the expected crop yield
determined by management to the historical
production yield and expected number of trays that
can be produced per hectare based on the land that
is currently owned and leased. We assessed whether
any variances in historical or expected volumes are
consistent with our understanding of planned
changes in the Group’s operations. Additionally we
compared the future selling price used by
management in their model to available industry
information.

-

Evaluating the historical accuracy of management’s
forecasted information through comparing prior
year forecast to actual results.

We had no matters to report as a result of our procedures.
Valuation of Land and Buildings
As reflected in note 9 of the financial statements, the
Group has a policy of revaluing their land and buildings on
a three year rolling cycle (excluding assets under
construction). At each balance date approximately one
third of the Group’s assets are revalued by an independent
external valuer. The Group then utilises their internal
valuation expertise to evaluate whether, based on the
results of the third party valuations, the remaining asset

PwC

Our audit of the land and buildings of the Group focused on
the judgements inherent in the valuation of those assets.
Our procedures included:
-

Assessing the objectivity and competence of
management’s internal valuation experts and third
party valuers, in addition to assessing the
independence of the third party valuers utilised by
management.

61

Seeka annual report 2017

Key audit matter
values remain appropriate and materially reflect fair value.

How our audit addressed the key audit
matter
-

Utilising our PwC valuation expert, we have assessed
key assumptions used in the external valuations by
comparing the valuation assumptions and inputs
used, such as capitalisation and discount rates, to
externally available data. Where external data was
not available, our internal valuation expert has
utilised his experience and knowledge to determine
whether the assumptions used by the third party
valuer were reasonable and appropriate in the
circumstances.

-

Reviewing and challenging management’s
assessment of the carrying values of the land and
buildings not independently revalued during 2017 by
comparing our own independent assessment of
valuation ranges using our PwC valuation expert.

Because the Group does not possess the internal valuation
capability to assess the appropriateness of the carrying
value of the Australian land and buildings relative to the
estimated fair value, management engaged an independent
third party valuer based in Australia to revalue all land and
buildings owned in Australia as at 31 December 2017.
The total value of Group’s land and buildings at year end is
$103.5 million.

We had no matters to report as a result of our procedures.

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The Directors are responsible for the annual report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements does not cover the other information included in the annual report and we do not and will
not express any form of assurance conclusion on the other information.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information
that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report
in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate
the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,

PwC

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs NZ and ISAs will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the
External Reporting Board’s website at:
https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards-for-assurance-practitioners/auditors-responsibilities/auditreport-1/
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Who we report to
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s shareholders, as a body, for our
audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Pip Cameron.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As at 31 December 2017
At Seeka, we conduct our business sustainably, safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best
outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.
Seeka supports the NZX Corporate Governance Code 2017 (the Code), and Seeka’s Board has reviewed and refined the company’s
corporate governance policies against the eight principles of the Code.
Seeka’s corporate governance statement and governance policies are available on Seeka’s website Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.
The following is a summary of Seeka’s governance actions and performance against each of the Code’s eight principles during the
reporting period. Seeka’s governance complies with the Code, with exceptions to any principle noted in this governance statement, and
listed on page 66 of this annual report.
The Board approved this governance statement on 23 February 2018.

Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards
being followed throughout the organisation.”
Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce
business that connects growers with customers. Our business spans, cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors
and management understand that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders,
customers and communities.
Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s published core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”
Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs and available on Seeka’s intranet. The code outlines how directors and
management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders,
adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”
The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:
• Conflicts of interest
• Use of Seeka information, assets and property
• Dealing with gifts or gratuities
• Respecting all stakeholders
• Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing
• Compliance with laws and Seeka policies
• Managing any breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics
Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy prohibiting the direct or indirect dealing of Seeka securities when holding inside information,
plus a duty of confidentiality that protects the dissemination and use of confidential company information.

Principle 2. Board composition and performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspective.”
Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interest of the company, deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board’s charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along
with the duties and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is responsible for:
• Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards
• Establishing corporate objectives and strategies
• Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies
• Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance
• Managing risk to Seeka’s business
58

• Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication

Seeka annual report 2017

The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal
representative. The chief executive officer is not a Board member.
The Board Charter was established December 2017. Prior to the charter, the Board operated to the same set of principles defined in the
charter.

Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for
an eighth to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings. Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support
Seeka’s objectives and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain
proper separation between governance and management, all directors are non-executive and the constitution has no provision for a
managing director.
Seeka’s Board currently has seven directors, led by the Independent Chairman Fred Hutchings, who joined the board in September 2012.
Non-independent director Amiel Diaz is the only director residing overseas.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all
relevant information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.
Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;
• Amiel Diaz, representative of Seeka’s largest shareholder Farmind Corporation of Japan, and
• Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka’s largest New Zealand shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chairman of the Ngai
Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit grower supplying Seeka.
As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors
have extensive experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are
considered non-independent directors;
• Martyn Brick
• John Burke, and
• Ratahi Cross
The Board has three independent directors;
• Fred Hutchings, Chairman
• Ashley Waugh, audit and risk committee chairman, and
• Cecilia Tarrant.

Director appointments and induction
As required the Chairman establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend
people with complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by
shareholders at the next annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder
meeting. The Board provides guidance to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability before any vote.
59

In 2017, following 15 years of service Malcolm Cartwright retired as a director. A nominations committee was formed to identify a replacement,
with Cecilia Tarrant recommended to shareholders and subsequently elected by shareholders at the 27 April 2017 annual shareholder meeting.
Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the company’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
Board.

director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 69 of this annual report.

Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a
deeper understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.
The Board works to optimise diversity across director members, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity
in culture and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key
clients, creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns.
With Seeka’s key client groups diversely spread from rural New Zealand to large urban centres in Asia, Seeka’s Board has encompassed cultural,
ethnical and gender diversity to strengthen business governance:
• Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is also a lecturer in Maori history
• Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia
• Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural backgrounds

Diversity Policy
Seeka is committed to providing an inclusive environment that supports a diversity of thinking and skills. This policy formalises the existing
conduct of the Board and management. Aspects of diversity include gender, ethnic background, religion, marital status, culture, disability,
economic background, education, language, physical appearance and sexual orientation.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, Seeka performed in adherence to its diversity policy.

Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”
The Board has established permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.

60

Seeka annual report 2017

All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and
committee members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited
by the committee. Committee charters are reviewed annually by the Board.

Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member Board with three independent directors. To provide effective and transparent committee
governance, while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an
independent director, with committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill
set.
The current standing committees are:

The Nominations Committee Charter was established December 2017. Prior to the charter, the Chairman established ad-hoc Board

In the event of a takeover offer, the Board Charter provides for the formation of an ad-hoc takeovers committee to operate under a written
charter.
Takeovers

committee.
While the Board considers the current range of committees comprehensively manages the governance of Seeka’s business, and provides
the best outcomes for shareholders and other stakeholders, the Board Charter allows ad-hoc committees to be formed as required to aid
Board decision making.

Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”
Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the
company’s operating environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka
provides stakeholders with a mid-year performance update, along with regular operational updates to supplying clients.
Seeka follows NZX continuous disclosure guidelines for the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and
other stakeholders. The Chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer are responsible for identifying material information between
Board meetings, with continuous disclosure covered at every Board meeting. Seeka’s Code of Ethics, Board and committee charters and
policies as recommended in the Code are available on Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.
As stewards of more than 230 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and
international guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes following the international GLOBALG.A.P
standard for good agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food.
Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health,
safety and welfare.
In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower
fruit value; kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers
appointing AvoFresh Limited.
Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions
and grower payments, and publish independently-audited annual statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils,
provides management support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s
operational performance for their fruit.
Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013
and the NZX Listing Rules. Seeka also supports environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any
environmental factors that may materially affect operations.

Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the Chairman uses professional advice and market information to review director remuneration
within a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last
sought in April 2015, when the pool limit was set at $400,000 per annum. Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according
to expected time commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board. Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and
receive no performance or retirement benefits. Directors are not required to own Seeka shares.

Chief executive officer remuneration
The review of the chief executive’s remuneration is undertaken by the remunerations committee with the remuneration package the
responsibility of the Board.
Michael Franks was appointed chief executive in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual remuneration that covers
base salary, vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.
The following table reports chief executive remuneration in 2017.

1. Benefits are delivered through vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance.
2. Performance incentive earned from FY16 and paid in 2017.

Performance incentive
The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 40% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set
by the Board, including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For the 2016 financial year, chief
executive officer Michael Franks earned an $182,500 performance incentive. This payment was made in 2017.
For the 2017 financial year, the chief executive officer earned a $156,800 performance incentive. This payment will be made in 2018.
Employee share scheme
Chief executive Michael Franks was allocated 15,000 shares at $3.05 per share under the 2014 employee share scheme. In 2017, these
shares vested, were taken up and issued to the chief executive at $2.372 per share.
At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated at $3.88 per share under the 2016 employee share scheme. These shares
vest in 2019.

Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should
regularly verify that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”
The Board consider risk management a major governance function that protects all stakeholders, builds long-term wealth in our
communities and optimises shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate control of risk management, with the audit and risk committee
providing a specific focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.

63

Business risks are identified, recorded on a risk register, assessed, managed through risk mitigation strategies and reviewed at least
annually.
Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess
business performance against budget and forecasts.
The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian
produce handling and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia to ensure all directors
understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.
The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk
associated with being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian
market and sourcing revenue from more points along the value chain. Since the incursion of the kiwifruit vine-killing disease Psa in 2010,
Seeka has transformed from being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler to become an Australasian produce business involved in the growing,
handling, supply and marketing of multiple products.

Health and safety
Operating in a seasonal industry, in 2017 Seeka employed more than 3,900 people working in multiple complex environments. This
includes 24-hour operations over the harvest period. Group salary and wages equate to 1,175 full time equivalents.
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager
to ensure Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of
health and safety risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.
The following table reports key health and safety measures in 2017 and 2018 targets.

1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of
hours worked. TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
2. Severity rate = (number of lost time injuries) / (number of days lost).

Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”
Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and
the markets with objective, clear and timely financial reporting.
The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the
external audit process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor.
The audit and risk committee:
• Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments,
and
• Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.
For financial year 2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for Seeka Limited, having been reappointed Seeka’s
auditor under the Companies Act 1993 at the 2017 annual shareholder meeting. PwC have confirmed their independence to the audit and
risk committee, and their independence was not compromised during the reporting period. The last audit partner rotation was in FY16.
PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.

64

Seeka annual report 2017

Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational
data. This includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring
management’s response to external audit findings.
Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s
financial systems.

Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to
engage with the issuer.”
Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities.
Seeka maintains open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering
excellence to all stakeholders.
The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
• Annual and interim reports
• Market announcements
• Annual shareholder meeting
• Mid-year stakeholder meeting
• Ad-hoc investor presentations
• Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type
• Quarterly all staff updates
• Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors
• Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team
Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update, where they can raise
matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which affect Seeka at the annual
shareholder meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the company’s
auditor PwC, on a one share, one vote principle.
Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual and interim report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by
contacting our registrar Link Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. The annual shareholders notice of meeting is posted on the
NZX website and sent to shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements can be directly
accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.
Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK

Remuneration includes key performance indicator payments. Remuneration by the Group’s Australian subsidiary Seeka Australia in
Australian dollars was converted to New Zealand dollars using the average exchange rate for the year. The impact of movements in
exchange rates from 2016 to 2017 was reviewed and would not have significantly changed the employee remuneration disclosure.

As part of their employment benefits, eligible permanent employees are invited to participate in Seeka’s employee share schemes. The
2014 employee share scheme allocated 343,000 shares to permanent employees at $3.05 per share. In 2017, these shares vested and
