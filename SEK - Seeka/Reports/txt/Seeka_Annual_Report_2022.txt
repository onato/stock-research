Our produce business
Select excellence from orchard to market

Seeka grows, processes and supplies premium, healthy fruit to domestic and international consumers. We are
founded on kiwifruit and have expanded to be New Zealand and Australia’s largest kiwifruit grower. We also
grow and supply New Zealand kiwiberry, avocados and citrus and Australian nashi, pears and other fruits.
We supply Zespri with premium New Zealand kiwifruit, while also servicing key retail customers in New Zealand, Australia and other
international markets. We also sell fresh produce from our Auckland wholesale market.
We are a large regional employer, operating packing and coolstore facilities in all major kiwifruit and avocado growing regions in New
Zealand’s North Island. Seeka also operates orchard and post harvest facilities in Victoria Australia, with Australians buying Seekasupplied fruit all year round.
We focus on supply chain management, and have extended our services to import and condition tropical fruits for New Zealand
retailers, plus we produce and sell avocado oil and the digestive aid Kiwi Crush.
At Seeka, we strive to deliver excellence from orchard to market.

Chair and Chief Executive's report
Welcome to Seeka’s annual report and commentary for the year ended 31 December 2022.
Seeka and its supplying growers experienced a very difficult year. Covid-19, adverse weather events,
extreme labour shortages, packing machine commissioning delays, shipping disruption, lower fruit
yields and poor fruit quality were key challenges. Additionally, lower market returns also impacted
financial performance. Despite these challenges, Seeka delivered $6.5 million profit after tax (2021
$14.9m); lower than target and the prior year, reflecting a difficult season.
Dividend distributions were paused while Seeka assessed its
financial position and focussed on prudent financial ratios.
New Zealand national kiwifruit volumes were well down on
expectation from seasonal fluctuations and storm damage
in the Ōpōtiki region. The New Zealand kiwifruit harvest
was then impacted by unusual maturity and poor weather,
especially around the Gisborne catchment, and despite
operating a full harvest season at OPAC, along with the newly
acquired Orangewood and Seeka Gisborne sites, Seeka only
packed 42.0 million class 1 trays of New Zealand kiwifruit in
2022, just 7% more than the 39.2m trays packed in 2021.
Labour availability was very tight and impacted by the surge
in Omicron-related absences. The Group innovated by
redeploying people and using contractors where available.
Loyal personnel worked hard to ensure continuity of
operations.
At one point Seeka was 1,100 people short from having a
full New Zealand seasonal workforce with the shortages
unevenly dispersed across regions and sites. The harvest
was completed with an influx of RSE workers from the
Pacific which added new challenges to accommodate them
and formalise their employment documentation. The cost
of labour also rose significantly as Seeka competed to fully
resource operations. Additional allowances were paid to
seasonal workers in response to the labour shortage.
The new, highly-automated MAF Roda kiwifruit packing
machine commissioned at KKP packhouse was late due to
Covid-19 shipping disruptions. This forced the redirection of
kiwifruit to other packing sites.
Shipping delays disrupted the supply chain to market.
Fruit quality in 2022 was poor, creating pressure on quality
checking as Seeka and the industry strove to deliver excellent
fruit to the market. Kiwifruit is a premium product requiring
careful and deliberate handling through the supply chain.
Early-season industry supply was out of specification
reflecting intense harvest pressures. Lower fruit quality
impacted market returns, which was exacerbated when
Zespri experienced high off-shore fruit loss.
Seeka’s fruit loss at the Ōpōtiki site was significantly higher
than the industry. The company, on behalf of growers,
has lodged an insurance claim for the associated losses in
kiwifruit orchard returns. Acceptance of this claim by the
underwriters is under review.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

Seeka Australia managed severe labour shortages and
market disruptions which impacted volumes and returns.
Labour supply has improved, and the business is looking to
lift earnings as Australian orcharding investments mature and
production increases.
Seeka is focussed on the immediate job of optimising its
operations, fully integrating recent acquisitions and improving
financial results in a volatile business environment. This
includes investing in packing automation and additional
coolstorage ahead of the increase in crop volumes, with
automation upgrades completed at Oakside packline 3 and at
Gisborne, and new coolstores built at Transcool.
In June 2022 the Group published its first Sustainability
Report, which alongside the publication of three years of
independently-verified emission measurements, set Seeka’s
target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, with interim
steps to achieve a 30% reduction on baseline by 2025 and
50% by 2030.
The large Ōpōtiki and Bay of Plenty catchments suffered a
heavy spring frost on 6 October 2022, which significantly
affected some orchards and will lower 2023 crop volumes.
Since Cyclone Gabrielle, Seeka has been inspecting post
harvest sites and supplying orchards to assess the potential
impact on harvest 2023. While no significant damage was
detected at Seeka's facilities, the full impact on crops will
likely remain unknown until the fruit is harvested.
Seeka's core Bay of Plenty kiwifruit growing region was spared
the worst and was not materially impacted. The Hawke’s
Bay, Gisborne, Coromandel and Kerikeri regions had varying
degrees of impact, and approximately 5% of Seeka's kiwifruit
supply is grown in the Hawke's Bay which was worst hit. The
Group will continue to assess the situation and will update the
market if it identifies a material loss.
Harvest 2023 kiwifruit volumes are expected to be lower
than harvest 2022 due to the early season frost, variable bud
break and the cyclone. Seeka's response includes a reduction
to the 2023 capital expenditure programme and reducing
costs in line with the lower crop expectation, with Seeka in a
strong position to handle the 2023 crop.

Dividend
In this challenging environment the Board has determined
that no dividend is payable.

Orcharding
Led by GM Orchards Barry Penellum

Revenue
– Leased and long term leased
orchards: costs plus profit share
– Managed orchards: costs plus
management fees

23%

of Group revenue

$80.5m
Up 4% on
FY21 $77.1m

Orcharding grew 17.0 million class 1 trays of kiwifruit compared to 14.4
million trays in 2021. The Ōpōtiki growing region was hit hard by high
winds and wild weather late in 2021 which reduced the volumes that
Seeka grew in this region by about 2 million trays.
Yields were much lower than expected. The average Hayward yield from Seeka’s
orcharding operations was 9,650 trays per hectare, down 22% on 2021. SunGold average
yield of 12,000 trays per hectare was down 16% on 2021.
Seeka also grew 1.7 million kilograms of avocado (2021: 1.4m kgs) and 116,400 kilograms
of kiwiberry (2021: 140,000 kgs), on orchards which it either owned or managed.
Labour shortages impacted the orchard business, including having to redeploy staff to
keep packhouses operating. Experienced RSE people were also repatriated after having
spent a prolonged stay in New Zealand. While sensible and fair, this resulted in untrained
personnel being deployed to prune orchards, which affected timing. This situation is now
resolved with an increase in the RSE quota alongside the normalisation of international
travel.
2022 orchard operations revenue of $80.5 million only rose $3.4 million on 2021, which
while disappointing, reflects lower yields and market returns. EBITDA was $4.6 million
compared to $5.2 million in 2021, due to lower market returns and higher costs.
Seeka's orchard operations were largely unaffected by the frost event in October 2022.

Seeka continues to actively co-invest in long term orchard developments, and currently
142 hectares of kiwifruit, two hectares of kiwiberry and 16 hectares of avocado are in
development. Fruit volumes from the orchard division are expected to increase as these
orchards mature. Seeka’s strategy is to continue to invest in long term leases to secure
fruit volumes.

Orchard operations span from Northland through the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty, Ōpōtiki and Te Kaha. Orchard operations
include all aspects of growing and harvesting kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry on leased, long term leased, and Seeka-owned
orchards. The orcharding business provides comprehensive orchard and vine management services to owners together with
contract work on an as-required basis. The business develops orchards for landowners on contract or under long term leases
and in partnership with iwi.

Post harvest
Led by GM Post Harvest Paul Crone

Post harvest packed 42.0 million class 1 trays of kiwifruit, above
last year's combined 39.2 million trays (including 3.5m trays
OPAC). Hayward volumes were down 21% and SunGold volumes
up 36%, both significantly impacted by yield reductions despite
the additional fruit provided from the three acquisitions.
Fruit loss was higher across the kiwifruit industry, and the Seeka OPAC site
delivered very high fruit loss. This is under investigation and Seeka has lodged an
insurance claim on behalf of growers.
The cost of labour increased as the Group competed in a tight labour market
amid Covid-19 disruption. The compliance requirements to meet demanding
market requirements also added cost pressure. Packing operations peaked with
the Omicron wave, and post harvest had to manage severe shortages. Seeka
expects the labour market to improve in 2023 aided by the increase in RSEs and
normalisation of travel.
In addition to packing avocado and class 2 kiwifruit for the SeekaFresh marketing
programmes, Seeka also packed 14.9 million kilograms of citrus and 5.2 million
kilograms of persimmons on contract for third party marketers.
Post harvest revenue of $233.8 million was up from last season (2021: $195.9m)
reflecting the recent acquisitions and price increases. EBITDA for the twelve
months was $59.0 million compared to $61.6 million in 2021, reflecting higher
labour costs to ensure continuity of operations.
With the completion of the KKP and Transcool upgrades, along with automation
upgrades at NZ Fruits and Oakside, Seeka is well positioned to handle 2023
kiwifruit volumes, with the capacity to pack more fruit using significantly less
labour.

Revenue
– Sales commission
– Service fee for imported fruit
– Processing fees

5%

of Group revenue

$19.1m

Revenue was down 12% to $19.1 million as seasonal variations in
fruit volumes and quality slowed sales. This flowed through to a
lower EBITDA of $0.8 million (2021: $2.3m) as Covid-19 continued
to disrupt supply logistics and added costs.
Weather disruptions slowed the 2022/23 avocado programme and impacted
yields along with the volume sold before year end. Export sales prior to Christmas
were also restrained by weak Australian pricing, with a higher percentage marketed
to New Zealand retail and wholesale.
Lower volumes and early-season quality issues also impacted revenue from the
SeekaFresh kiwifruit sales programme into New Zealand and Australia, and the
Group's collaborative marketing programme into Asia.
SeekaFresh tropical fruit import and ripening services, along with kiwiberry sales,
the Auckland wholesale market and Kiwi Crush operations, responded to the
challenges and opportunities of 2022, and continued to make a contribution to

Australia
Led by GM Australian Operations Jonathan van Popering

Seeka’s Australian business was affected by Covid-19. The
business adapted well under local management and delivered
satisfactory results in challenging conditions.

Revenue

Labour was very short, and there was continuing market disruption through
lockdown events in Australia. The Australian team innovated to complete 2022
on-orchard work and used post harvest automation to deliver customers excellent
service and produce, despite supply chain disruptions.
Australian kiwifruit yields were 15% lower, mainly due to 2021 labour shortages
which contributed to the late completion of orchard work. This has been rectified
and the orchards are well prepared for harvest 2023, which will include the first
crops from new developments.

– Fruit sales

Markets were strong in 2022 for Seeka's Australian-grown produce with good

Automation, technology and capacity
Seeka has undertaken numerous automation trials and assembled the best and latest
packing equipment in the KKP packhouse.
The eight-lane MAF Roda includes fully automated delivery of packaging and automated packing stations,
resulting in a very low labour demand. While it missed the 2022 commissioning date due to supply chain
disruptions, the packline is now installed and fully commissioned for harvest 2023.
Seeka has invested in further automation enhancements at Oakside in the Bay of Plenty, and at Seeka Gisborne.
The Oakside investment includes Spectrim grading and pre-sizing on machine 3, which will substantially reduce
labour demand and lift machine throughput. The Gisborne investment includes automation of the placement and
stacking of fruit post-packing on pallets. It removes labour and a processing bottleneck. Throughputs and operating
hours at Gisborne are set to increase with automation reducing the associated labour demand.
Seeka continues to consider forward capacity, balancing likely crop volumes against the post harvest capacity. The
efficient packing and coolstorage of kiwifruit as close as possible to its optimal maturity, sets the base to deliver
high-quality fruit to the markets.
The industry is anticipating a large increase in SunGold volumes in the coming seasons. There is also a growing
sentiment among the growers that the harvest must be completed earlier in the season. Both factors require
continuing consideration of investment in packing automation and storage capacity.
Seeka, with the investments outlined, has sufficient capacity to handle the forecast crop volumes for 2023 and
is considering the volumes and options for 2024 and beyond. The company has reviewed its five year capacity
plan, and as a result has adopted a staged automation pathway and understands the options to address capacity
pinch-points.

Sustainability
Seeka has released its first Sustainability Report; an important milestone in Seeka’s
sustainability journey. It details the founding of the sustainability team through to
the verification of three years of carbon emissions data and the establishment of our
commitment to reduce our impact on the environment.
As a result of these initiatives, Seeka has held its level of carbon emissions reasonably constant even though the
Group has grown. It is our commitment to reduce our carbon emissions from our 2019 base year by 30% by
2025, 50% by 2030 and to be net carbon zero by 2050.
Achieving these goals will include removing harmful refrigerants by limiting equipment leaks, switching to
low emission vehicles and an increasing investment in solar power. The Group has made good progress in
understanding sustainability and our impact on the environments we operate in.

Health and safety
The continuing shortage of labour heightens the safety risk as
the Group strives to deliver service to its grower customers.
Seeka people have worked hard, in stressful circumstances, with the added
anxiety of Covid-19. Seeka took all efforts to ensure that we kept our people
safe and have continued to invest in their safety. Sites were effectively locked
down to minimise the chance of spreading illness between operations. Support
staff were required to work from home and the business pivoted to remove
face-to-face meetings.

The focus continues on physical safety with ongoing emphasis on barriers

Orangewood site. In that incident a person fractured their arm when their clothing got caught in a drive shaft
while repacking fruit after the completion of harvest. It is disappointing given the significant effort and focus on
safety throughout the Group and particularly through the heavy pressure of harvest.

Strategy
The Group continued to enact its strategy and concentrated on operational excellence. Seeka
undertakes disciplined planning to ensure each harvest and all operations are well executed,
and that we have the necessary capacity and that we pay attention to keeping people safe,
while considering the financial attributes and contingency plans.
The Group continues to implement and trial automation technologies to improve efficiency, remove labour and
improve fruit quality. Seeka also concentrates on supply chain efficiency wherever it operates an integrated supply
service to the market or customer.
Seeka has focussed on integrating and optimising the newly-acquired operations from its growth strategy. Seeka
predominantly operates in the horticultural industry and therefore operates in a seasonal environment. While
2022 yields were below normal and fruit quality was challenging, we expect these fluctuations to normalise
following what will be a weather-impacted 2023 harvest.
Seeka has progressed its people and capability initiatives, made pleasing progress with its drive to understand
and be more sustainable as a business, and maintained financial capability to invest and to deliver future earnings
growth. The Group continues to concentrate on its foundation through disciplined planning.

Summary
Seeka's people have excelled in a difficult harvest across Australia and New
Zealand. They have adapted, innovated and strived through a challenging year.
Dedicated key staff across the Group worked hard to deliver a continuous service to growers and
Seeka's market partners. Our people continue to make Seeka an inspiring produce company to
work for and are celebrated for their efforts.
Harvest 2022 kiwifruit yields were down across the industry, impacting the potential revenues
from the Group's core post harvest business. Kiwifruit storage performance, both onshore and
offshore, further impacted returns to New Zealand orchard operations.
The Group has reviewed its supply chain operations from the orchard to loadout, and is focussed
on achieving excellence in fruit handling in 2023. Seeka is anticipating an improved labour supply
with a large increase in RSE workers from the Pacific, and a normalisation of public health both in
New Zealand and Australia.
The completion of automation projects at KKP and Oakside in the Bay of Plenty, and at Seeka
Gisborne, will both lift post harvest capacity and improve fruit handling, while significantly
reducing the demand for packhouse labour.
Seeka has the capacity, systems and personnel to deliver an excellent operational performance in
2023, and is considering options to build capacity as New Zealand kiwifruit volumes continue to
grow. The range of complementary fruits grown, handled and marketed by the Group continues to
grow, and will deliver incremental returns to shareholders.
As Seeka expands its operations, we continue to focus on delivering a sustainable business, and
are implementing a range of carbon-reduction initiatives as we work towards becoming net zero
carbon by 2050.
We value the communities we operate in, and thank our loyal growers, workforce and shareholders
for their ongoing support.

ESG report 2022
Seeka is creating a sustainable future for the environment, employees, suppliers,
customers, and shareholders as we work to grow, pack, store and supply fresh and
healthy produce to the people of the world.
From eastern Tairāwhiti Gisborne to the north in Kerikeri, and across to Shepparton,
in Victoria Australia, Seeka works with the land and its people to produce highvalue nutritional fruit. By focussing on regenerative horticulture, Seeka is working to
enhance biodiversity and create long-term wealth and employment.
As well as stewarding the land, Seeka adds to the social capital of rural communities. In 2022, Seeka
employed 804 permanent and more than 5,700 seasonal workers, 1,200 of which were RSEs from the
Pacific. Working with landowners, Seeka is converting land into profitable and sustainable orchards. As
productivity grows and new horticultural regions are created, Seeka is instrumental in stimulating local
economies and creating new employment opportunities.
Since 2019, Seeka has been measuring and verifying its carbon footprint, and in 2022 set its target to
be net zero carbon by 2050. To progress its strategy, Seeka is reducing its carbon-intensive operations
and collaborating with supply chain partners to achieve a stepped set of interim reduction targets. Gains
include improved energy efficiency, new solar power installations, switching to low emission vehicles, and
the diversion of organic waste to Seeka’s own worm farm.
As operations are exposed to weather and the effect of climate change, in 2022 Seeka reassessed climate
risks and adopted the XRB Climate Related Disclosure Framework to help build resilience and improve
Seeka’s adaptability,

Climate-related disclosures
Governance
Seeka’s Board is responsible for ensuring Seeka meets its obligations under environmental, social
and governance principles. The Board has delegated oversight of these activities to its Sustainability
Committee.
The Sustainability Committee, comprised of three Board members, provides strategic guidance and
feedback on Seeka's sustainability framework. The Committee oversees the establishment of reduction
targets, footprint measurements, performance monitoring, and the assessment of the potential impacts
and opportunities of a changing climate.
The Sustainability Committee has reviewed Seeka’s climate-related risks and opportunities, and oversees
Seeka’s carbon reduction strategies and projects, including climate risk mitigation and adaptation
planning.

Environmental report
Seeka's aim is to be an industry leader, transparently reporting its environmental impact along with the
opportunities and risks associated with climate change.
Climate change is an active risk, impacting the yield, quality, and marketability of the produce Seeka
grows and handles. By disclosing climate-related risks, stakeholders can see how Seeka is flexing business
activities and operations to mitigate environmental risks and embrace new opportunities.
Seeka is committed to advancing regenerative horticulture practices with Seeka's research and
development team conducting environmental trials to better understand the impact of orchard inputs
such as sprays, fertilisers, and irrigation. The resulting knowledge leads to more sustainable on-orchard
practices that are shared with our growers.
Seeka has analysed all business operations to identify and understand the production inputs, how they
flow through the business, and the waste outputs that impact the environment. Seeka is working to
transition to a regenerative model whereby waste is circulated back into operations, to reduce Seeka’s
environmental impact.

Sustainability reporting
In June 2022, Seeka released its first comprehensive Sustainability Report which outlines its journey to
be a leader in sustainable horticulture practices and build long-term employment in rural communities.
Sustainability is central to Seeka’s business and lies at the heart of the brand value Growing Futures.
Seeka has measured, validated, and reported its carbon footprint since 2019, and in June 2022 Seeka set
its goal to be net carbon zero by 2050. Seeka’s annual Sustainability Reports will update stakeholders
on Seeka’s progress towards its environmental, social and governance goals, including climate risks and
opportunities, along with potential impacts, mitigation, and adaptation strategies. Seeka's reports will
align with the XRB’s climate related disclosure requirements.

Sustainability projects 2022
Seeka's 2022 carbon reduction initiatives have delivered sustainability gains, and form a base for further developments in 2023.

Hybrid vehicle fleet

Waste management

To facilitate the transition to low carbon
transport, Seeka has installed two 7kW electric
vehicle chargers at Seeka 360 Head Office.
New low-carbon options are being added to
Seeka’s owned and leased vehicle fleet which
currently operates ten hybrid vehicles.

In 2022, Seeka introduced soft plastics
recycling at Seeka 360 Head Office to reduce
waste going to landfill. On orchard, Seeka
recycled strings from more than 100 hectares
of kiwifruit vines, which are recycled into useful
agricultural products.

Seeka’s 2023 goals are to grow its electric
vehicle charging network and the percentage
of low-carbon vehicles.

Seeka’s 2023 goals are to extend soft plastic
recycling to regional operations, and work with
our supply chain and waste service providers
to promote closed-loop waste systems.

Worm farm
In 2022, 50 tonnes of organic post harvest
waste was diverted from landfill to Seeka’s
worm farm. Nutrient-rich organic soil
conditioner recovered at the worm farm
is recycled back to Seeka orchards in a
regenerative process.
Seeka’s 2023 goals are to maximise worm farm
waste recovery and trial alternative organic
waste inputs, and investigate applying circular
waste management to other areas of the
business.

Solar energy

Regenerative horticulture
Regenerative horticulture builds natural
resilience into our orchards. In 2022, Seeka
promoted sward growth, beneficial plantings,
mowing practices that reduce weed sprays,
supported organic orcharding, reduced use
of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers, protected
sensitive environments with riparian plantings,
and continued research on optimising soil
health to improve carbon and water storage.
Seeka’s 2023 goals are to expand regenerative
horticulture, and share findings with the
grower community.

In 2022, Seeka had 446kW of solar installed
across its Australia and New Zealand sites
which produced more than 400MWh of
renewable energy; enough to power an electric
car 66 times around the earth. Seeka’s post
harvest facilities have large roof spaces suitable
for solar. While reducing Seeka’s carbon
footprint, Solar also mitigates the cost of grid
energy price increases.

Zero GWP refrigerants

Seeka’s 2023 goal is to progress solar to
achieve 1000kW of installations by 2025.

Seeka’s 2023 goal is to further improve
refrigerant leak detection and repair systems.

LED lighting and sensors

Packaging and waste

In 2022, Seeka added more LEDs and motion
sensors to its large post harvest sites. These
new LEDs use up to 70% less power than
existing fittings. Stage one of Seeka’s roll out is
expected to save nearly a million kWh annually.

Seeka is moving the fresh produce industry
towards a circular economy using low-impact
packaging and is working with experts to
introduce new technology and materials to the
logistics processes.

Seeka’s 2023 goals are to explore daylight
sensors, and continue installing LED lighting
and motion sensors.

Seeka’s 2023 goals are to progress packaging
innovation and align operations with the New
Zealand Government’s ban on plastic products.

In 2022, Seeka upgraded Transcool coolstores
with a new zero-carbon refrigeration system. By
replacing legacy coolstores with high-efficiency
rooms and ammonia coolant systems, Seeka is
progressing its commitment to achieve a 50%
reduction in harmful coolant leaks from the
2019 baseline.

Main contents
Financial contents

Basis of preparation
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements. Accounting policies
which are limited to a specific note are described in that note.

Reporting entity and statutory base

Basis of consolidation

The financial statements presented are those of the consolidated
Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as Seeka Limited or the
Company. The group is referred to as the Group, Seeka, or Seeka
Group.

Subsidiaries

Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New
Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets
Conduct (FMC) Reporting Entity for the purposes of the FMC Act
2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the
NZX main board equity security market (NZX Main Board).

Nature of operations
Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
In New Zealand the Group provides orchard management, orchard
leasing, post harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit,
avocado, citrus, berry and kiwiberry industries. Seeka manufactures
and sells the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product range along with
avocado oil. The Group also provides retail and ripening services for
imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale market.
In Australia, Seeka owns, leases and operates orchards and associated
post harvest assets, making the Group the largest producer and
supplier of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of
European pears, plus lesser production of other temperate-climate
fruits.

Summary of significant accounting policies
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the
periods presented in the financial statements.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The financial statements for the Group have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the FMC Act 2013.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),
incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other applicable financial
reporting standards as appropriate for profit-orientated entities. The
Group financial statements also comply with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with
the exception of:
– assets classified as held for sale at fair value (note 9)
– land and buildings at fair value (note 10)

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intragroup balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting
from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets exchanged, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date the acquisition is
settled. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on
transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency (NZD) using the exchange rates prevailing during the month
of that transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income
statement. The presentational currency is the New Zealand dollar
(NZD).
Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of
which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
– Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the
Group are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance
sheet;
– Income and expenses for each entity's income statement
and statement of comprehensive income, are translated at
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
– All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other
comprehensive income.

– water shares at fair value (note 11)
– biological assets - crop at fair value (note 12)
– right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities at present value of
expected cash payments (note 13)
– investment in financial assets held at fair value (note 23)
– financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at
fair value through comprehensive income (note 30 and note 31)
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
financial statements are set out below.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the
Board) on 23 February 2023.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future
operational and financial performance. By definition, these
assumptions may not always equal actual results. The estimates
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are
identified in the notes below. Estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as
adjusted for current market conditions and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Assumptions underlying management’s estimates
can be found in the following notes to the financial statements.

Valuation on acquisition

The Group’s loan facilities expire on 31 January 2024 and 31 January
2025 (see note 17) and there is no indication that these would not be
able to be refinanced at that time.
While there are uncertainties in the near-term financial performance
of the Group, the outlook for the company and the industry remains
positive. Annual crop volumes will grow as previous SunGold licence
releases mature and reach full production, and the continuing release
of new SunGold and RubyRed licences by Zespri.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Goods and services tax (GST)
The statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive
income have been prepared so that all components are stated
exclusive of GST. All items in the statement of financial position are
stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables,
which include GST invoiced.

Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the
entity
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have
been issued and are effective that are expected to have a significant
impact on the Group.

Going concern assumption
For the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group’s profitability was
adversely affected by lower kiwifruit crop yields, a wind event in Ōpōtiki,
challenging fruit quality and a tight labour market. The 2023 harvest has
been impacted by a significant frost event, variable bud break in spring
2022, and Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023, see note 8.
Due to events prior to Cyclone Gabrielle, the Group obtained
agreement from its banking syndicate in December 2022 to modify
two of the financial covenants for the test dates as at 31 December
2022, 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023.
The Directors have considered the forecast cash flows and covenant
compliance, including the expected impact from Cyclone Gabrielle
on the 2023 harvest. The Directors have concluded that, based on
the current information, there are no material uncertainties that the
Group would not be able to comply with those covenants as at 30 June
2023 and 31 December 2023, which are those within the 12 months
following the approval of the Group’s financial statements.
The key processes and assumptions applied in preparing the forecast
financial covenant compliance for the next 12 months are:
– kiwifruit crop forecasts for the 2023 harvest have been based on
inspections at orchards in late January and early February 2023
– targeted orchard inspections and discussions with affected growers
following Cyclone Gabrielle and making adjustments to the kiwifruit
crop forecasts for the expected crop reductions
– no further significant adverse weather events affecting the 2023
kiwifruit harvest and a normal picking and packing period.
The Group's earnings and cash flows can vary from expectations
due to unanticipated events, and such variations may increase the
possibility of breaching financial covenants. In the event that there was
a potential future or actual breach of financial covenants, the Group
has a number of avenues to manage costs and / or reduce debt. The
Directors have confidence that the banking syndicate would work with
the Group to further revise financial covenants, if that was required.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in business
activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a
manner consistent with the internal reports provided to the chief
decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the
allocation of resources alongside operational outcomes, such as
EBITDA and EBIT, and are responsible for setting strategic direction.
The Group has five operating segments:
– Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary
services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the
retail sector.
– A single Australian operating segment covers the integrated supply
chain service for the Group’s Australian-grown fruit.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each
segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs
and other income from the sale of assets recorded in the statement
of profit or loss are allocated to all other segments. Transactions
between segments are conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated
on consolidation.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations

Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and
internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This
includes fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post
harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported fruit, and operates a wholesale market.
Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi
Crush, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and hospitals,
along with post harvest services for kiwiberry.
All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower
services and overhead sections recorded in the statement of profit or
loss and impairment and revaluations of other assets not attributed
directly to any other segment. It also includes the gain on sale from
assets that had been classified as held for sale, and in 2021 the
proceeds from the settlement of the Psa claim with the Crown.

Australian operations
The Group grows, provides post harvest services, and retails all
produce from orchards the Group owns or leases in Australia. The
main products are kiwifruit, nashi pears and European pears, which are
primarily sold in Australia.

The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and kiwiberry from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
orchard owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
citrus, berry, persimmon and kiwiberry industries. This includes all
crops from the Group’s orchard management and lease operations,
plus crops from independent orchard owners.

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors and
management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expense associated with
debt (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large investments in fixed and leased
assets (EBITDA).

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Financial contents

Accounting policies
The Group’s major revenue streams are post harvest operations,
orchard management, retail services and Australian operations in
accordance with NZ IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers (NZ
IFRS 15).
Post harvest

Contracts from acquired businesses
All revenue contracts acquired as part of the Orangewood Limited
(Orangewood) and NZ Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits) acquisitions, (see
note 19) are substantially similar in nature to Seeka’s current revenue
contracts.

The Group enters into two standardised post harvest contracts:

Principal versus agent relationship

– The first has two performance obligations; to collect the supply
of fruit via picking and transportation, and maturity testing. The
charges are separated in the contract. All revenue is recognised
when the service is performed.

A principal relationship is one where the Group has the performance
obligation to provide the good or service directly and has control of the
asset or has a right to direct the asset. An agency relationship is one
where the performance obligation is to arrange for the good or service
on behalf of the supplier. The Group currently has agent relationships
for the sale of some fruit and vegetables in the retail services segment.

– The second has three performance obligations; to pack fruit, to cool
and dispatch fruit, and to sell class 2 fruit to authorised markets.
These are stand-alone services provided by the Group. Each
performance obligation has a separate transaction price detailed in
the contract and the obligations are recognised when services are
performed; packing revenue as fruit is packed, cooling revenue as
fruit is loaded out from cool storage, and class 2 as fruit is sold and
delivered.
Orchard management
The Group enters into two orchard management contracts that are
largely standardised:
– The first has one performance obligation; to manage fruit growing.
Revenue is recognised as the service is performed and calculated
at cost plus a margin per the contract or at a fixed per-hectare
charge. The management fee included in the contract is recognised
evenly over the contract's 12 month period. An incentive fee is only
recognised when agreed orchard gate return (OGR) targets are
achieved and an incentive would be receivable.
– The second has one performance obligation; to collect the supply
of fruit on short term and long term managed orchards. The
transaction price is determined using a forecasted OGR. Revenue
is recognised when crops are picked (in the June half year accounts
for kiwifruit).
Retail services
The Group enters into three retail service contracts which are
customised to the service being offered (such as ripening or fruit sales):

Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations,
with post harvest revenues recognised as services are provided and
orcharding revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail
revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New Zealand kiwifruit
are harvested from March to June, avocados from July to February, and
kiwiberry from February to March. In Australia nashi and European
pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit from March to
May. As a result of these harvest timings around 60~70% of orchard
revenues are recognised in the first six months of the financial year.
Due to seasonal fluctuations, the timing of the provision of post
harvest services can vary from year to year, however normally 70~80%
is recognised in the first six months of the financial year, but can be
impacted by seasonal fluctuations.
Irrigation water rights
Water allocation rights are carried at fair value supported by the
value of the traded rights on a recognised exchange or market at
measurement date. Annual water allocation rights are recognised as
a current asset when they are allocated to the Group's permanent
water shares from the first of July each year by the Victorian Water
Register, and are subsequently expensed when the entitlement is
used to irrigate orchards. Any gain on revaluation is recognised in the
statement of profit or loss.
Interest income

– The first has one performance obligation; to sell fruit on the owner’s
behalf. As the sales agent, the Group only collects a marketer’s
commission which is recognised when the fruit is sold and delivered.

Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the
effective interest method.

– The second has one performance obligation; to either store or ripen
fruit. Revenue is recognised as the fruit is stored or ripened.

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.

– The third has one performance obligation; to provide ordered
product. The transaction price is based on the agreed price (either
in writing or verbally) with revenue recognised when the fruit is sold
and delivered.

Gain on sale of assets classified as held for sale

Australia
The Group has one type of contract that is entered by the Australian
business; for the sale and supply of fruit.
– The fruit sale and supply contacts are entered on a one-to-one basis
with the fruit purchaser and are largely standardised. They have one
performance obligation; to provide the fruit to the customer. The
transaction price is based on the agreed price (either in writing or
verbally) and recognised when the fruit is sold and delivered.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

Dividend income

The gain on sale of assets classified as held for sale is recognised when
a sale and purchase agreement is unconditional and the consideration
is paid or payable at that date.
Proceeds from settlement of kiwifruit Psa claim
The income relating to the proceeds from the settlement of the
kiwifruit Psa claim from the Crown was recognised in 2021 when
the claim was settled and the amount was confirmed as received or
receivable.

During the year the Group recognised $0.04m of costs relating to the measurement of the employee share schemes issued based on the Black
Scholes Model (Dec 2021 - $0.15m).

Accounting policies
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred, except where future economic benefits arise and they are
recorded as a prepayment.
Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are
recognised in other payables. The employee liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating
sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date,
and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability
in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit. Differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following table details the offset amounts.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2021 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.

8. Events occurring after balance date
Cyclone Gabrielle
From 13 to 15 February 2023, Cyclone Gabrielle brought severe wind and rain over much of New Zealand's North Island. A number of the Group's
kiwifruit and avocado growing regions felt the force of Cyclone Gabrielle.
The Group is undertaking an initial impact assessment, but a complete understanding of the full extent of the impact on the 2023 crops will likely
remain unknown until the fruit is harvested.
The Group's core Bay of Plenty kiwifruit growing region was spared the worst of the weather and was not materially impacted by the event.
However, the Hawke’s Bay, Gisborne, Coromandel and Kerikeri regions had varying degrees of impact, with Hawke’s Bay being worst hit.
Approximately 5% of the Group's kiwifruit supply is grown in the Hawke’s Bay region. The Group will continue to assess the impact of the cyclone
and will update the market if it identifies a material loss.
The Group has made an initial assessment of its major assets and has not identified any significant damage.
Harvest 2023 kiwifruit volumes are expected to be lower than the 2022 harvest year due to an early season frost, variable bud break and now
this cyclone. The Group's response to this circumstance includes a reduction to the 2023 capital expenditure programme and a focus on reducing
costs in line with the lower crop expectation.
There are no other material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statements.

At 31 December 2022, 16.6 hectares of Northland orchards (Dec 2021 - 13.5 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. During the
year three additional properties including, one 3.5 hectare orchard in Ōpōtiki, were classified as held for sale, with two subsequently sold within the
year. No growing costs have been attributed to the remaining orchards at 31 December 2022 as they are valued on a crop-off basis.
At 31 December 2022, 750ML of permanent water entitlement in Victoria, Australia, was classified as held for sale (Dec 2021 - Nil). The sale of
the water entitlement settled on 22 February 2023 for a consideration of $3.08m AUD.
All assets classified as held for sale are included in the orchard operations segment, apart from $3.3m related to the water entitlement (Dec 2021
- Nil) which was included in the Australian operations segment.
Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition,
and the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within one year from the date of classification. The accounting standard
allows for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control. As at 31 December 2022 one
orchard of 13.5 hectares (Dec 2021 - one orchard of 13.5 hectares) has taken longer than 12 months to find a willing buyer, however Seeka remains
committed to selling the property and a sale is anticipated within the next 12 months. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of
the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group used judgement to recognise the remaining orchards as held for sale, despite one being held for sale for greater than 12 months.
This judgement is based on the ability to obtain a buyer for the assets classified as held for sale. This is impacted by external real estate market forces
and changes to this estimate may result in the balance being reclassified to a non-current asset.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and
are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred
to the appropriate asset class. At 31 December 2022, assets under
construction relate to the Transcool coolstore construction, and further
investment relating to packhouse automation.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a
three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for
buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by CBRE Limited
t/a Telfer Young from CBRE, independent registered valuer.
In Australia valuations were undertaken by Opteon (Goulburn North
East Vic) Pty Ltd, independent valuers based in Victoria, Australia. All
Australian land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2022.
The valuers consider four different approaches in concert to arrive at
a fair value;
SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1. Direct replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the
replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements based on
the current cost of construction less depreciation based on the age
of the building with an allowance for physical depreciation. Specific
consideration is given to the 'optimised depreciated replacement
cost' methodology.
2. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.
3. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the property
with a current market rental being established and capitalising this
at an appropriate rate of return that would be expected by a prudent
investor. The 2022 year saw capitalisation rates decrease between
0.25% - 1.50% since the previous valuations of the same properties,
some of which may have been up to three years prior.
4. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method
whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the
investment method and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year
period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market rentals
and estimated costs incurred to maintain land and buildings in
operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are sold in
the terminal year (year 11).

Significant unobservable inputs inherit in the land and building
valuation process include potential comparative market rentals, the
market rental capitalisation rates and discount rates. The higher the
rental rate, the higher the fair value, and the higher the capitalisation
or discount rate, the lower the fair value. Significant changes in either
of these inputs would result in significant changes to the fair value
measurement. See below;

2. Rental capitalisation rates - Capitalistion rates as described in the
valuation reports obtained in 2022 were between 6.00% – 8.75%
(Dec 2021 - 6.50% - 9.00%).

1. Market rental rates - Packhouse rental rates as described in the
valuation reports obtained in 2022 between $60/m2 - $130/m2 (Dec
2021 - $47.50/m2 - $66.45/m2). Coolstore rental rates were between
$0.40/tray - $0.65/tray (Dec 2021 - $0.36/tray - $0.60/tray)

The net book value of land is $47.41m (Dec 2021 - $36.87m) and
buildings is $203.53m (Dec 2021 - $191.65m), see note 29.

3. Discount rates – Discount rates as described in the valuation rates
obtained in 2022 were between 6.50% - 9.00% (Dec 2021 – 7.00%
- 9.25%).

The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax, of $9.74m in the year ended
31 December 2022 (Dec 2021 - $11.54m).

As a consequence of the building revaluations conducted December 2022, $6.38m (Dec 2021 - $3.45m) of accumulated depreciation was offset
directly against the assets' cost or valuation, prior to revaluation.
During the year the Group reviewed and estimated the useful lives of its buildings. The result of this review was an increase of the useful lives of
the buildings to align them all with a 50 year useful life from the date of the estimate. This has standardised the useful lives of the buildings, but
they remain within the useful life range of the existing accounting policy. This change in useful lives took effect from 1 July 2022. The effect of the
change was to decrease depreciation in the second half of the year by $1.2m, compared to what the depreciation would have been if no changes
had been made. This will have a similar effect on future periods.

Impairment of bearer plants
For the year ended 31 December 2022, $0.14m of assets were
impaired (Dec 2021 - Nil). This related to the impairment of
capitalised structures on a long-term-leased orchard.
Impairment of plant and equipment
For the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group did not impair
any fixed assets. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group
impaired the following fixed assets:

– Coolstore facilities at Transcool in preparation for the construction
of a new five-high, semi-automated, coolstore facility

Accounting policies

Property, plant and equipment
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical
cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to
purchase the asset.

Bearer plants
Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear, avocado
and other fruiting vines and trees on Group-owned and leased land.
Bearer plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical
cost includes all costs incurred to purchase or establish the asset.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at
least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any subsequent
improvements at cost, less depreciation. At each annual balance date,
no less than one third of assets classified as land and buildings are
revalued and those valuations are used to assess the appropriateness
of the carrying values of all land and building assets held by the Group,
which effectively revalue all land and buildings annually. Revaluations
are performed more frequently if changing industry conditions may
cause their carrying value to differ significantly from fair value. Any
accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is
restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and
buildings are accounted for through comprehensive income and other
reserves, except where an asset's assessed fair value is less than the
original cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of
profit or loss.

– An existing canopy at KKP packhouse in preparation for the
construction of the packhouse extension
– Decommissioning of the existing 10 lane grader at KKP to be
replaced by a new MAF Roda grader

Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other
repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit or loss
during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Asset impairments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.
The estimated useful lives of assets from revaluation date are:
– Buildings
20 - 50 years
– Machinery
10 - 20 years
– Vehicles
2 - 15 years
– Furniture, fittings and equipment
3 - 10 years
– Bearer plants
5 - 50 years
ANNUAL REPORT 2022 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Financial contents

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted
if appropriate, at balance date and an asset’s carrying amount is
immediately written down to its recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is included in the
statement of profit or loss. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts
included in the revaluation reserve in respect of those assets are
transferred to retained earnings.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 31 December 2022, 42% (Dec 2021 - 44%) of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was revalued in line with policy. From 1 July 2022
the Group has reviewed the useful lives of its buildings and noticed many that required evaluation, while remaining within the policy above. The impact
of this evaluation in 2022 is an increase in useful lives and a $1.2m decrease in depreciation charged in the period.
All building useful lives remain within the policy above with it remaining unchanged. Seeka operates in the food production industry, which remained
stable with a high demand for healthy foods during the Covid-19 pandemic. Properties situated in the Bay of Plenty are also expected to be less affected
than other regions given the ongoing strength of horticulture and agriculture businesses.
Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause a movement in land and buildings of between 5.56.5%. This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

Water shares are an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure
required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual crops in Australia
and are carried at fair value based on the closing water share market
price. The movement in the fair value is recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income. There was a gain in the fair value of water
shares in the year ended 31 December 2022 of $0.21m (Dec 2021 - Nil).

varieties and growing methods. Seeka has a long history of adapting
to the environment, such as when Psa arrived in New Zealand and the
business pivoted to the SunGold variety, alongside past climatic events
such as droughts, hail and floods. The business will continue to adapt to
the changing environment.
The annual impairment tests of goodwill were performed at 30 November
2022. Impairment indicators were considered at 31 December 2022,
however no indictors were identified that required any further impairment
tests. In previous years the annual impairment tests had been performed
at 31 December. The change in the current year was made to more closely
align with the timing of the annual budget and five year plan processes.

Impairment tests for goodwill
At 31 December 2022, the Group's market capitalisation was $128.1m
compared to net assets of $270.9m. As a result, an impairment test
was performed on all cash generating units (CGUs), in addition to
CGUs with goodwill balances to ensure that future cash flows of the
CGUs and Group support the fair value of the assets.

Additions to goodwill

Goodwill represents the 2022 acquisition of NZ Fruits, the 2021
acquisitions of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited (OPAC) and
Orangewood Limited, the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete Coolstores
Limited, the 2018 acquisition of the Northland business, the
previously-acquired Glassfields business (now named SeekaFresh) and
the acquisition of the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the
five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value-in-use), with a terminal
value beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period
are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates
stated in this note. The assumptions used for the analysis of the net
present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit is
determined based on past performance and the Board's expectations
of future market dynamics, plus the Group's five year financial plans.

During the year $3.54m of goodwill was recognised as a result of
the NZ Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits) acquisition and a further $0.15m
from updates to the goodwill acquired in the Orangewood Limited
(Orangewood) acquisition. In the year ended 31 December 2021,
$8.25m of goodwill was recognised, $7.63m from the OPAC
acquisition and $0.62m from the Orangewood acquisition. See note 19
for details of the business combinations.
Cash generating units (CGUs)
During the year ended 31 December 2022, the scope of the post harvest
CGUs were reviewed. Previously the post harvest CGUs were defined by
the geographical region, with one CGU being the Bay of Plenty and East
Coast region and a second CGU for Northland post harvest. However,
based on the most recent update of the Group’s capacity planning and
five year financial planning, more fruit is expected to be connected
through the supply chain between these two regions. Therefore, the fruit
flows, and as a result the cash flows, are interdependent and the CGUs
are better reflected as a single collective post harvest group.

The impact of a frost event in spring 2022 along with a lower forecast
yield as a result of variable bud break is forecasted to reduce the volume
harvested in FY23. The effect of these events have been incorporated
into the impairment tests. The impact of climate change has also been
incorporated to the extent that it impacts the forecasts and considered
as part of scenario planning from an operational capacity planning
perspective. Any financial impact of climate change is expected to fall
outside of the planning period given the long-term nature of climate
change. However, scenario planning is being carried out across the
Company to prepare for the impact of climate change on future yields,

This better reflects the operational coordination of packhouses in each
region to maximise efficiency and flexibility by packing fruit at the
optimum maturity by allocating it to the next available facility.
The goodwill that arose through the NZ Fruits acquisition, as well as the
goodwill from the OPAC and Orangewood acquisitions, are all part of the
post harvest CGU.

The following table details how water shares would be stated on the historical cost basis.

1. The discount rate is calculated based on the specific circumstances
of the cash generating unit and its operations, and is derived from
its weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate for Seeka's
post harvest CGU is set at 9% as this represents the Board's
assessment of the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
2. The long term growth rate is based on the long term expected
inflation rate, being within the RBNZ inflationary target of 1%-3%.
48

The Group has set its terminal growth rates at 2% to ensure a
long term conservative growth estimate has been applied in the
impairment tests.
3. The EBITDA growth rate for the 2024 year assumes a return to
“normal” yields and therefore represents a 36% increase. However,
the remaining EBITDA growth rates sit between 2-4%, which is
considered conservative for the kiwifruit industry.
ANNUAL REPORT 2022 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Financial contents

4. The EBITDA growth rates for Seeka Fresh appear significant, but
only due to the low profitability achieved by this segment. The
business remains in a loss making position over the period of the
impairment test.
5. The EBITDA growth used for the Kiwi Crush reflect a 9.4% increase
in year one, and then a growth rate between 0%-1% every year
thereafter. This reflects the consistency in the profitability of this
CGU, with limited growth expected over the period.
6. EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations.
At 31 December 2022, all goodwill balances were reviewed for
indicators of impairment.
Post harvest CGU
The goodwill relating to the post harvest cash generating unit is
supported by historical profitability, with a positive outlook and
significant growth path ahead. The 2022 kiwifruit harvest, despite
being challenging, achieved increased total volumes on the prior year
and packing volumes are expected to increase further in future years.
Challenges in the 2022 harvest, including lower yields, poorer storing
kiwifruit, labour availability issues, and issues across the supply chain,
caused a decline in profitability. However, the post harvest segment
operated profitably throughout the year.
For these reasons, there are no indications of impairment of the
goodwill relating to the post harvest cash generating unit.
No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an
impairment of goodwill.
SeekaFresh CGU
The fresh market has been impacted significantly by three years of
Covid-19 disruption, in particular servicing the hospitality industry
which has been struggling due to lockdowns predominately in
Auckland. The second half of 2022 saw promising improvements in the
fresh market business as new markets and customers were accessed.

Accounting policies

Profitability from commissions has decreased, due to lower volumes of
class two kiwifruit, alongside lower volumes and variable quality in the
start of the 2022/23 avocado harvest. The commissions in both these
key categories have been lower than previous years. Class 2 kiwifruit
returns are expected to improve in coming years as more volume
comes onstream.
Despite the fresh market turnaround in the second half of the year,
alongside a forecast kiwifruit volume increase, the forecast assumes a
post-tax operating loss for the five year period of the impairment test.
This has led to impairment being identified within the CGU and the
entirety of the goodwill, being $0.43m, has been impaired in the year
ended 31 December 2022.
The impairment and recoverable amount of the CGU have been
calculated using both the value-in-use method and fair value less
costs of disposal. The value-in-use method was used. The recoverable
amount of the assets in the CGU is $2.07m.
Kiwi Crush CGU
The Kiwi Crush CGU has operated profitably and consistently since
the business was acquired. The kiwiberry variety has performed very
well. Demand for Kiwi Crush in supermarkets, hospitals, and aged care
facilities remains high, particularly as the product is high in vitamin
C and has proven health benefits. However, using a higher discount
rate than in previous years, the returns of the business do not support
the book value of the assets held. Impairment was identified within
the CGU and the entirety of the goodwill, being $0.24m, has been
impaired in the year ended 31 December 2022.
The impairment and recoverable amount of the CGU have been
calculated using both the value-in-use method and fair value less
costs of disposal. The value-in-use method was used. The recoverable
amount of the assets in the CGU is $2.93m.

Intangible assets

Water shares

Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and
amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite life
are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually
for impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. When assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able to
generate cash flow.

The Group records permanent water shares at fair value based on the
market price at balance date. The shares are fully tradeable and have
an indefinite life and are not amortised.

Software

Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are
not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment,
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that they might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher
of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups
of assets (cash-generating units (CGUs)). Non-financial assets other
than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible
reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Internally developed computer software is capitalised when it enters
the development phase and includes costs incurred to develop and
test the software for use. Intangible assets are amortised over their
estimated useful life (typically three to five years).
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the
fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill on a business acquisition is included
in intangible assets, and on acquisition of an associate is included in
investments in associates. When acquired in business combinations,
the goodwill is annually tested for impairment (or more frequently if
there are impairment indicators) and carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to that business.

Other intangibles
Other intangibles subject to amortisation are amortised over the life
of the asset on a straight line basis. The expense is charged to the
statement of profit or loss.
Impairment of assets

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The intangible assets impairment tests require judgement to determine the appropriate forecast cash flows and inputs into the calculations. The primary
estimates relate to the forecast EBITDA growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates.
At 31 December 2022, impairment was identified in the SeekaFresh and Kiwi Crush CGUs as a result of the impairment tests performed.

Crop where fair value cannot be measured reliably
Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date therefore
fair value is not able to be measured reliably and, as such, these crops are measured initially at cost less impairment.
Crop valued at fair value
Where a crop has achieved sufficient biological transformation, it is measured at fair value less costs to sell using unobservable inputs in the fair
value assessment. These unobservable inputs include forecasted sales prices achieved once the crop is harvested and marketed for sale, if the
forecast price was to increase so would the fair value of the crop.

Accounting policies
The Group's biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group's leased and owned orchards. All crops have a maturity period of
less than one year and will be harvested within 12 months from the Group's balance date.
Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell provided this can be measured reliably, otherwise they are measured at cost.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred fair value is not able to be measured reliably. Biological assets at cost are not depreciated as
they are in the process of maturing.
Fair value is determined as the estimated net market return less selling costs and costs to market.

Accounting policies
Lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, including any renewal periods that are likely to be exercised,
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate which ranges between 5.37% and 12.36%. The discount rate is based on the Group's
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate the Group would borrow the funds required to purchase the asset. When determining the discount rate,
Seeka considers that the value of the right-of-use lease asset should not be greater than the fair value of the underlying asset being leased.
The Group’s right-of-use lease asset is equal to the lease liability on the day of lease inception, with the exception of sale and leaseback
transactions where the asset is measured as the proportion of the carrying value of the asset sold of which the benefit is retained by the Group.
The right-of-use lease asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Costs incurred with a lease that are not part of the
cost of the right-of-use lease asset are expensed.
All leases have been classified into one of the following asset classes:
– Land and building - leases for rental of all properties, including packhouses and coolstores
– Orchard - leases held for the development of productive orchards
– Equipment - leases for equipment, including plant equipment and forklifts
– Motor vehicles - three year leases for motor vehicles
The Group leases various properties for the packing and cooling of kiwifruit, leases orchards to grow kiwifruit and avocados, and leases equipment
and vehicles. The terms of the leases vary, with land and building leases ranging from 10 - 15 years, with one 99 year lease. Orchard leases range
from 3 - 25 years, and equipment and vehicle leases range from 1 - 3 years.
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. In the case of orchard leases, only the fixed rental is recognised as a lease liability.
Any variable consideration relating to profit share on the orchard leases is not accounted for as the profit share is only determined after a crop has
been harvested and is not identifiable at the commencement of the lease. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide
range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interest in the leased assets
that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
The Group is exposed to potential future increases in land and building lease payments based on contractual market rent reviews that are not
included in the lease liability until the rent review takes place.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and lease interest. The lease interest is charged to the statement of profit or loss over the term of
the lease.

Prepaid deposits includes $0.62m for avocado trees and kiwifruit vines not yet received (Dec 2021 - $1.15m).
At December 2021, accrued income included $2.26m of funds received in FY22 in relation to the settlement of the Psa claim.
The balance in accrued income and other sundry receivables includes income to be received from orcharding operations over leased and owned
orchards relating to 419 hectares (Dec 2021 - 399 hectares).
A $0.24m provision for doubtful debts is recognised in the accounts (Dec 2021 - $0.25m).
At December 2022, non-current trade receivables includes $2.20m losses carried forward on Hayward short term leased orchards to be recovered
in a future period when the orchards return to a profit making position expected in the 2024 harvest. The remaining balance of non-current trade
receivables relates to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up to five years and is considered recoverable.
Non current receivables also include $3.06m (Dec 2021 - $0.84m) of long term receivable balances with agreed long-term payment terms.

Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Grower loyalty share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit,
avocado and kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share
scheme, whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares
based on their orchard's current or forecast production. This issue of up
to 2.6m shares was approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
In April 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on
behalf of 405 participating growers. The issue price of $4.76 per share
was funded by the Group making a $9.8m non-interest-bearing loan
to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying
all product from the participating orchards for three consecutive
seasons the shares vest and participating growers can elect to pay the
outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend payments made on
the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.

In 2021, 1,917,165 shares issued to kiwifruit growers vested. In 2022, the
remaining 144,638 shares issued to avocado growers vested, see note 21.
Employee share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible employees to participate in
a three-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would
be allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business. In
April 2019, 568,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on
behalf of 319 participating employees. The issue price of $4.76 per share
was funded by the Group making a $2.7m non-interest-bearing loan
to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing
employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can
elect to pay the outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend
payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.
Shares issued under this scheme vested in 2022, see note 21.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

19. Business combination
Acquisition through amalgamation of New Zealand Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits)
In February 2022, the Group amalgamated NZ Fruits, a kiwifruit, citrus and persimmon post harvest business based in Gisborne, East Coast, New
Zealand, into a newly-formed 100%-owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Seeka East Limited. NZ Fruits shares were cancelled with each share
being exchanged for 7.5016 shares in Seeka and $39.3495 cash. Seeka shares were issued based on a price of $5.2455 per Seeka share (equal to
the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 9 December 2021, with all fractions of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole
number).
The purchase was settled on 2 February 2022 for a consideration of $17.53m by the issue of 1,687,860 ordinary shares in Seeka at a market price of
$5.14 on the settlement date of 2 February 2022, being the market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), and a
cash consideration of $8.85m. The change in the share price on acquisition date had the impact of decreasing goodwill by $0.18m.
NZ Fruits has contributed $15.30m of revenue and $0.18m of net profit before tax to the Group for the period 2 February to 31 December 2022. If
the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2022, NZ Fruits would have contributed $15.60m of revenue and $0.32m of net loss before tax for the
year ended 31 December 2022. These calculations are not significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies between the Group and the
acquired subsidiary, and no significant additional depreciation would have been charged for fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment
had it applied from 1 January 2022, including consequential tax effects.
The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

NZ Fruits fair value of assets and liabilities, goodwill and acquisition-related costs
The fair value of acquired trade receivables is $0.34m. There is no loss allowance recognised on acquisition. The goodwill of $3.54m is allocated to
the renamed Post Harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of the amalgamation was to obtain the packhouse facility and increase the
Group's presence in the East Coast, which is adjacent and complementary to the main Bay of Plenty operations. The goodwill is attributable to the
operation’s market position in the region and synergies expected to arise after adding the business into the corporate structure provided by the
larger Seeka Group. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired in the foreseeable future and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs of $0.37m and integration-related costs of $0.09m are included in overhead expenses in 2022. Deferred tax of $0.23m
has been provided in relation to differences between tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets.
Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the fair values of the assets and liabilities disclosed above if more information comes
to light that suggests the values differ. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the
acquisition date.

Acquisition through amalgamation of Orangewood Limited (Orangewood)
In November 2021, the Group amalgamated Orangewood, an integrated kiwifruit and avocado post harvest and orchard management business
based in Kerikeri, Far North District, New Zealand, into a newly formed 100% owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Northland Horticulture
Limited. Orangewood shares were cancelled with each share being exchanged for 0.663 shares in Seeka and $1.35 cash. Seeka shares were issued
based on a price of $5.33 per Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 13 September 2021, with all
fractions of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole number).
The purchase was settled on 22 November 2021 for a purchase consideration of $4.66m by the issue of 639,302 ordinary shares in Seeka Limited
at a market price of $5.25 on the settlement date of 22 November 2021, being the market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3, and a
cash consideration of $1.30m. The change in the share price on acquisition date had the impact of decreasing goodwill by $0.05m
Acquisition-related costs of $0.02m were included in overhead expenses in the year ended 31 December 2022 (Dec 2021 - $0.37m).
Seeka had 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the fair values of the assets and liabilities disclosed above if more information comes
to light that suggests the values differ. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the
acquisition date.
Seeka has identified and updated the fair values of assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and completeness of payroll-related accruals made in
the initial fair values as disclosed in December 2021 and the tax implications arising as a result. The net impact is an increase in goodwill by $0.15m.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The fair values of assets are subject to estimates and judgement. Seeka engaged CBRE Limited t/a Telfer Young from CBRE to complete an
independent valuation of the land and buildings at the acquisition dates. The remaining property, plant and equipment was assessed on a depreciated
historical cost basis, as well as a physical stocktake and a comparison to similar Seeka-owned assets. The Group assessed that any intangible asset
that exists for grower relationships and contracts would be immaterial for financial reporting using the multi-period excess earnings method of
calculating intangible assets on contracts.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued and outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

The foreign currency revaluation reserve records unrealised gains and losses on Group assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies.
The share entitlement reserve records the value of option benefits recognised on the Group's grower loyalty and employee share schemes as detailed
in this note.
The Group operated two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
– An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
– An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust
deed established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the sale of shares are used
to repay the debt owed to the Company.

Grower loyalty share scheme
Under the grower loyalty share schemes, shares were issued to a share trust in return for a debt owed back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvest seasons, with the final harvest season
being the avocado harvest season ending 31 March 2022. The option benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period.
At the end of the vesting period the grower had an option to either settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to
them, or to not have the shares transferred to them, whereby any outstanding debt was forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The proceeds
from the shares that vest or from the sale of shares was used to repay the debt owed to the Company.
In September 2021, the three-season supply commitment period for kiwifruit and kiwiberry growers ended, and 1,917,165 shares vested.
In April 2022, the three-season supply commitment period for avocado growers ended, and 144,638 shares vested.

For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust on behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.

Accounting policies
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or
loss with a corresponding increase in the share entitlement reserve. For the Grower Loyalty Share Scheme (GLSS), the fair value of the grower
loyalty received in exchange for the grant of the option is recognised as a discount against other income in the statement of profit or loss with a
corresponding increase in share entitlement reserve. The fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, calculated
using the Black Scholes pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth
targets).
When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those shares is transferred to retained earnings.
Employee share scheme shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average Price
(VWAP) calculation of the Company's shares during the period prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with further
shares if that issue would result in the ESS having an interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.
Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the debt
between ESS and GLSS and the Group on behalf of the employee of the grower.
Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited to share capital when payment for the shares is received.
The ESS and GLSS have a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated to employees and growers. Annually the Group reviews the ESS
scheme and decides upon the allocation of further shares and the price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS and GLSS
are appointed for an unspecified term and may be removed by the Company at any time.

Dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend
reinvestment plan. Cash dividend payments during the year were $4.37m (Dec 2021 - $11.72m).
In 2021, the dividends paid were reviewed and amended for the NRWT on international shareholder dividends, resulting in an adjustment of
$0.08m.
On 20 January 2022, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend was paid 23 February 2022 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 28 January 2022. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with no discount to the strike price.
Seeka dividend policy
Seeka’s dividend policy is to declare and distribute dividends between 65% and 75% of Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) annually in conjunction with
the release of the half year and full year results subject to due consideration of the Board and approval of the banking syndicate.
In addition to this, following agreement by Seeka's Banking Syndicate to amend certain covenants, it is a requirement that dividends will only
be paid if the net leverage ratio banking covenant in the most recent Compliance Certificate does not exceed 4.00:1:00 during the period 1 July
2022 to 29 June 2023 and 3.75:1.00 during the period 30 June 2023 to 29 June 2024 and they shall be less than or equal to 75% of NPAT for the
financial year.
The net leverage ratio is calculated as total net debt less the $46m working capital facility, to adjusted EBITDA.

Accounting policies
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end off the period by not distributed as balance date.

The Group owns a 33% share in TKL Logistics Limited, which is a logistics company that provides services for kiwifruit including transportation,
vessel planning, and ECPI. Historically this company did not build any equity value. However in 2022 the Group has recognised the value of its
investment equivalent to its share of the TKL Logistics Limited's profits.

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but
not control, typically by holding between 20% to 70% of the voting rights
in the entity or exercising significant influence via directors on the Board.

The Group's share of associates profits or losses are recognised in the
statement of profit or loss and the carrying amount of the investment in
the statement of financial position.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after
initially being recognised at cost.

Dividends or distributions received from associates are applied to reduce
the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

42.9%

The Apanui Road Joint Venture is considered a joint operation based on the following:
– There is equal voting rights and influence;
– There is no investment vehicle that separates the entities from the parties to the arrangement; and,
– The legal form and contractual arrangements through which the investee operates give the parties rights to the individual assets and liabilities
of the investee (rather than the net assets as a whole).
The orchards of Apanui Road Orchards Joint Venture have a finite life, are carried at their fair value and are included in the consolidated financial
statements.

Accounting policies
Investment in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and
obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
Joint operations
The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings.
Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the statement of financial position.

28. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to producing
and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate financial risks related
to credit, liquidity and capital risk. The Group operates a comprehensive
risk assessment and mitigation programme via its Audit and Risk
Committee.

– Fire risk is typically from serious grass wild-fire occurring during
periods of extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority
responsible for risk assessment and management of fire events.
The Group takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk
including removing excess vegetation from Group properties.

The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value and
maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders,
as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources are available for the
development of the Group’s business whilst managing its financial risks.

All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest
incursions. The kiwifruit vine disease Pseudomonas syringae pv.
actinidiae (Psa) is widespread throughout New Zealand, and is being
actively managed. In 2018 Psa was detected on the Group's kiwifruit
orchards in Australia. Seeka has moved to contain the outbreak and
works to proactively monitor the orchards. The Queensland fruit
fly and brown marmorated stink bug are potential threats to the
horticulture industry. To minimise the risk of crop loss the Group
monitors its orchards and undertakes recognised spray programmes
to protect crops to the fullest extent possible. Seeka also relies on the
Ministry for Primary Industries to protect New Zealand's borders from
introduced diseases.

a. Risk management strategies related to orcharding,
post harvest and retail operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production and
market returns. The main short-term production risks are weather
events, diseases, and pests. These impact on volume and quality
of produce from the Group's orchards, volumes to post harvest
(both from Group orchard operations and independent growers)
and volumes available to the retail business. The primary risk to the
completion of the coming harvest is the limited availability of labour.
The Group is also impacted by the long-term effects of climate change.
Market risks include price and exchange rate impact on orchard
operations (the amount the Group is paid for crops grown by the
Group) and impact on retail revenues where the Group imports and
sells produce, mainly bananas. The exchange rate risk on imports is
managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts to match
known and planned purchases. Market risks do not directly impact on
post harvest operations, as charges are normally set prior to harvest
and deducted before sales revenues are paid to supplying growers.
The Group operates in five regions spread over two countries; New
Zealand's Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne and the Bay of Plenty
regions, and in Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce
lines are kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears and avocados, with
small production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail
activities are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce),
Australia and Asia. The Group's geographical, product and market
spread limits the impact on Group operations from an adverse event
occurring in a specific region, produce or market. To further mitigate
risks, the Board uses the following strategies.
Production risks - weather events, disease and pests
The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production risks.
This includes orchard management practices to optimise production from
Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure post harvest and retail
services are suitably resourced to manage each season's crop volumes.
In New Zealand the major climatic risks are hail, frost, storm damage
and drought.

Labour availability
Seeka relies on local people, the Recognised Seasonal Employer
(RSE) scheme and backpackers for its seasonal workforce. Seeka has
an extensive local recruitment process, including working with the
Ministry for Social Development and iwi on methods of recruiting
unemployed people into the Seeka workforce.
Since 2022, the New Zealand Government has opened access to
seasonal workers from Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu, from which Seeka
has the ability to employ up to 1,200 seasonal employees.
Long-term climate change
As a horticultural based business, Seeka is exposed to the long-term
impact of climate change through potential reduced production crop
yields. In addition to responding to weather events, future regulatory
change may impact Seeka through revised policies that limit the use
of chemical inputs on orchards, require soil monitoring and reporting,
introduce carbon taxes, and implement water restrictions.
To respond to this Seeka is;
– Working closely with regional councils and regulators to assist in
regulation change;
– Actively engaged in developing orchard management practices to
measure the environmental impact on orchards;
– Measuring the carbon footprint of Seeka's operations, with a
number of carbon-reduction initiatives underway;
– Ensuring new developments undertaken by Seeka include water
accessibility as part of the development design, whether via stream
access, onsite storage, or developing wetlands; and
– Reporting orchards by altitude to assess the risk of rising sea levels.

– Hail events are typically highly localised, and for kiwifruit the Group has
access to industry hail insurance for its orchard operations, plus top-up
payments from a Seeka Growers Limited hail insurance programme.

Market returns

– Frost events are typically regional, and the Group advocates bestpractice crop protection, including active frost management on kiwifruit
orchards operated by the Group and other growers supplying the
Group's post harvest operations.

The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit
harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing activities
beyond Australia are undertaken by Zespri Group Limited (Zespri)
under statutory regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the
level of Zespri's market returns which impact on the Group's orchard
profitability. The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling
techniques to analyse current and projected orchard income. This
information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease
terms.

– Storm events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including shelter belts on all orchards
operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's post
harvest operations.
– Drought events are typically regional, and the Group has invested
in irrigation in many of its orchards. The Group is also investing in
localised weather measurement on its orchards.
In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As the
owner and operator of all orchards supplying its Australian operations,
the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total production base.
The orchards are located on three sites in the Mundoona region.
– Drought events are typically regional, and to secure adequate
irrigation, the Group has purchased extensive, long-term water
shares from a reliable irrigation programme.
– Hail events are typically localised, and the Group currently has hail
cloth protecting one orchard.
SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

New Zealand kiwifruit

New Zealand avocado and kiwiberry
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocado and
kiwiberry, with half of kiwiberry sales and all avocado sales managed
by the Group's retail operations. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns. This information is used when
setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.
The Group has no direct currency risk from export sales as it does not
own the products but acts as the growers’ agent.

67

Main contents
Financial contents

Imported tropical produce
The Group has a direct market, price and currency risk from imported fruit produce (banana, pineapple and papaya) where the Group imports
fruit produce for sale as the principal through its supply and sale contracts. The Group may hedge up to the total known and projected cash flows
to manage exchange risk. The Group has no material direct price and currency risk from imported fruit produce where the supply agreement
enables the Group to amend its purchase price according to trading conditions.
Australian produce
The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian operations. As
the largest single grower and supplier of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong relationships with key retailers. The
Group forecasts seasonal supply, monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around the needs of key retailers and controls product
quality and supply to optimise market access and returns.
Seeka Australia is the Group’s single major international operation, exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk includes
future commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed through borrowings in
Australian dollars, see note 17.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers,
including outstanding receivables, derivative financial instruments and committed transactions.
The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The Group's maximum
exposure is the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the statement of financial position.
For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require any collateral or
security to support financial instruments due to the quality of the financial institutions.
For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post harvest
services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is therefore not considered significant.
Trade receivables
The Group applies the NZ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (NZ IFRS 9) simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the
payment profiles of sales over a 12 month period before 31 December 2022 and the corresponding historical credit losses during this period, adjusted
for any significant known amounts that are not recoverable.
On that basis, the following table details the provision for doubtful debts.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure
that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity
requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.
When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.
At balance date, the Group had $210.56m (Dec 2021 - $190.41m) of available credit of which $151.26m (Dec 2021 - $113.51m) was drawn. All
credit lines are currently provided by a bank syndicate comprised of five lenders across New Zealand and Australia, where Westpac New Zealand
Limited acts as the syndicate agent lender, security trustee and lead lender.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios, net leverage ratios,
and earnings times interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants. The Group, however, obtained
agreement from its banking syndicate in December 2022 to modify two of it covenants for the test periods 31 December 2022, 30 June 2023 and
31 December 2023.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position as
investment in financial assets and water shares within intangible assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industry-related
entities, only some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity
reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through comprehensive income or the statement of profit or loss whenever a previous
revaluation reserve balance is available. When no such reserve exists, any related loss is processed directly in the statement of profit or loss,
otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.

29. Determination of fair values of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities
The different levels are defined as:

– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement
date. Instruments in level 1 are comprised of water shares.

– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to
be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant
would use when determining an appropriate price.

The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.

Accounting policies
Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be
estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes. Fair value measurements are categorised into a three-level
hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation techniques
used.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such
as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and investment in shares)
is based on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The
quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the
current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial
liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active
market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined
using valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses the
appropriate method and makes assumptions that are based on market
conditions at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer
quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments
held.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows. Other techniques, such as
estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for
the remaining financial instruments.
Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade
receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values
due to their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and
liabilities with unobservable (level 3 inputs), reflects the assumptions
that market participants would use when determining an appropriate
price; additional disclosure is provided for the inputs and assumptions
used in such cases.
Land and buildings
Fair value is based on an annual revaluation, which is performed
on land and buildings based on a rolling three-year cycle by an
independent valuer, with approximately one third of land and buildings
assets valued each year using four different approaches as described
in note 10.

Term loan

The fair values of the interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts are determined by Westpac New Zealand Limited and
reviewed by the Board.
The gains and losses recognised in comprehensive income appear in
the statement of profit or loss.
Hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge
relationship and through annual prospective effectiveness
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between
the hedged item and hedging instrument.

Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:
– the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps
which is not matched by the loan,
– differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and
loans, or,
– trading ceases to exist in the foreign currency.

The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical
terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment

There was no material ineffectiveness during 2022 or 2021 in relation
to the interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts.

Accounting policies

Cash flow hedge
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge
relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,
exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging
instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time
remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of
profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to
occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in comprehensive
income is immediately transferred to the statement of profit or loss
within other gains / (losses).

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their
fair value at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised
as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative
is designated and effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the
hedge relationship. Derivatives are classified as current or non-current
based on the effective date.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At
the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
72

dates, maturities and notional amount. The Group enters into foreign
exchange contracts where purchases or receipts are expected to be
settled in that foreign currency. The Group does not hedge 100% of its
loans or foreign exchange contracts.

Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation
technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are
applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are based
on quoted market rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by
Westpac New Zealand Limited.

Accounting policies
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following
categories in accordance with NZ IFRS 9:
– amortised cost for financial assets and liabilities,

Financial instruments are not reclassified subsequent to their initial
recognition unless the Group changes its business model in which case
all affected financial instruments are reclassified on the first day of the
first reporting period following the change in the business model.

– assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI),

A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets both
of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL:

– assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL),

– it is held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows; and

– liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and

– its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding.

– other financial liabilities.
The classification of financial assets and liabilities under NZ IFRS
9 is generally based on the business model in which the financial
instrument is managed and its contractual cash flows characteristics.
On initial recognition, a financial instrument is classified as measured
at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for
trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent
changes in the investment’s fair value in other comprehensive income.
The election is made on an investment by investment basis.
All financial instruments not classified as measured at amortised cost
or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.

Independent auditor’s report
To the shareholders of Seeka Limited

Our opinion
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company), including its
subsidiaries (the Group), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at
31 December 2022, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Description of the key audit matter
Forecast compliance with bank financial
covenants
As at 31 December 2022 the Group had
banking facilities totalling $210.6 million of
which $151.3 million was drawn.
As noted in the basis of preparation section
of the financial statements, following
several adverse events affecting
profitability, the Group obtained agreement
from its banking syndicate in December
2022 to modify some of the financial
covenants in the Syndicated Facilities
Agreement for the test dates as at 31
December 2022, 30 June 2023 and 31
December 2023.
The Group complied with all financial
covenants throughout the year ended 31
December 2022.
The Directors have considered the forecast
cash flows and covenant compliance,
including the expected impact from
Cyclone Gabrielle on the 2023 harvest. The
Directors have concluded that, based on
the current information, there are no
material uncertainties that the Group would
not be able to comply with those covenants
as at 30 June 2023 and 31 December
2023, which are those within the 12 months
following the approval of the Group’s
financial statements.
In order to assess the impact of Cyclone
Gabrielle the Group has undertaken
targeted inspections and discussions with
affected growers to understand and
determine expected kiwifruit crop
reductions.
Forecast compliance with bank financial
covenants is considered a key audit matter
due to the significant level of management
judgement applied in estimating the future
performance used in calculating covenant
compliance.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our procedures included:
● identifying and evaluating the design, and
determining the implementation of controls related
to forecasting financial covenant compliance;
● obtaining and reading the Syndicated Facilities
Agreement and amendments to that agreement;
● obtaining the Group’s financial covenants
calculation for the year ended 31 December 2022
and testing the accuracy of the calculations;
● obtaining the Group’s forecast financial covenants
for the test dates as at 30 June 2023 and 31
December 2023, which cover those within the 12
months following the approval of the Group’s
financial statements and:
○ assessing the reasonableness of
management’s forecasts in light of historical
performance and our analysis of the forecasts
used in the goodwill impairment tests;
○ evaluating the reasonableness of the Group’s
sensitivities to the forecast by performing our
own sensitivities and stress tests of significant
assumptions to assess the level of forecasting
risk at each test date;
○ evaluating the reasonableness of a number of
factors that the Group identified that may
improve earnings and / or reduce debt before
the two financial covenant test dates;
○ evaluating management's assessment of the
effect of Cyclone Gabrielle on the crop
estimates for the 2023 harvest and, therefore,
the forecast financial performance for the year
ending 31 December 2023, including:
■ obtaining the Group’s estimate, and
supporting calculations and evidence of
the impact of this event on the 2023
kiwifruit harvest;
■ discussing management’s process for
preparing this forecast impact;
■ for a sample of orchards, validating the
estimated impact on the kiwifruit crop by
discussing the impact with growers,
including the Group’s grower-Directors;

Description of the key audit matter

Goodwill impairment tests
As at 31 December 2022, the carrying
amount of the Group’s goodwill amounted
to $20.2 million as disclosed in note 11 of
the financial statements.
Management has performed impairment
testing for each cash generating unit (CGU)
on a value-in-use basis, using a discounted
cash flow model based on forecast future
performance to determine the recoverable
amount.
As a result of the impairment tests at 30
November 2022 the goodwill balances
associated with the SeekaFresh and Kiwi
Crush CGUs were fully impaired.
There was no impairment identified for the
Post Harvest CGU. Goodwill recognised as
at 31 December 2022 solely relates to this
CGU.
The impairment testing of goodwill is
considered a key audit matter due to the
significant level of management judgement
applied in estimating the future
performance and cash flows for the Group
and material CGUs, along with the discount
rate and terminal growth rate used in
estimating the recoverable amounts.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
○ assessing the estimated impact and
uncertainties in this estimate against the
headroom in the forecast financial covenant
calculations at the two financial covenant test
dates;
○ obtaining appropriate representations from the
Directors; and
● reviewing the adequacy of the disclosures in the
financial statements.
Our audit focused on assessing and challenging the
significant estimates and assumptions used by
management in the impairment tests, along with
evaluating the overall Group impairment test.
Our procedures included:
● identifying and evaluating the design, and
determining the implementation of controls related
to the impairment tests
● evaluating the appropriateness of the CGUs,
including the changes made to the definition of the
Group’s CGUs during the year;
● agreeing the cash flows included in management’s
impairment model for each CGU to the latest board
approved five year plan and budget for the year
ending 31 December 2023;
● assessing the Group’s forecasting accuracy by
comparing historical forecasts to actual results;
● evaluating the key cash flow assumptions by
obtaining from management a detailed analysis of
supporting information including, for the Post
Harvest CGU, the forecast supply of trays to the
packhouses, earnings per tray, and overheads. We
compared this information to historical outcomes
and external reports;
● engaging our in-house valuation expert to assist us
with:
○ assessing whether the discount rates and
long-term growth rates used by management
for each CGU was reasonable in the context
of the forecasts; and
○ considering management’s paper comparing
the net assets and the market capitalisation of
the Company. This analysis was completed as
part of our assessment of indicators of
impairment.

Valuation of land and buildings
As reflected in note 10 of the financial
statements, the Group has a policy of
revaluing its land and buildings on a threeyear rolling cycle (excluding assets under
construction). At each balance date
approximately one-third of the Group’s
properties are revalued by an independent
external valuer using a combination of four
different approaches to arrive at a fair
value.
The Group then utilises its internal
valuation expertise to evaluate whether,
based on the results of the third party
valuations and other recent market data,
the remaining New Zealand and Australia
asset values remain appropriate and
materially reflect fair value. No material
change was identified.
The total value of the Group’s land and
buildings at year end is $250.9 million.
We included the valuation of land and
buildings as a key audit matter because of
the level of judgement inherent in the
valuations.

testing the accuracy of the calculations in
management’s impairment model for each CGU,
and checking the carrying amount of the CGU’s net
assets was correct;
performing a sensitivity analysis across a range of
reasonably possible changes in cash flow
assumptions;
assessed whether there were any impairment
indicators between 30 November 2022 and
31 December 2022; and
reviewing the adequacy of the disclosures in the
financial statements.

Our audit of the land and buildings of the Group focused
on the judgements inherent in the valuation of those
assets.
Our procedures included:
● identifying and evaluating the design, and
determining the implementation of controls related
to the valuations
● assessing the independence, objectivity and
competence of the third party valuers;
● engaging our in-house valuation expert to challenge
the work performed by the third party valuers and
assess the reasonableness of the assumptions
used, such as capitalisation and discount rates;
● reviewing and challenging management’s
assessment of the carrying values of the Group’s
land and buildings not independently revalued
during 2022 by comparing our own independent
assessment of valuation ranges using our own
valuation expert; and
● reviewing the adequacy of the disclosures in the
financial statements.

Our audit approach
Overview
Overall Group materiality: $2,450,000, which represents approximately
0.70% of revenue.
We chose revenue as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the
benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most
commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted benchmark.
The Group operates in a high-volume low margin industry where net
profit is not representative of the scale of the Group.
In determining the materiality amount we ensured that it was less than
the headroom in the Group’s bank financial covenants calculation as at
31 December 2022.
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement, we:
●

Selected two entities for full scope audits

●

Performed specified audit procedures and analytical review
procedures on the remaining entities

As reported above, we have three key audit matters, being:
●
●
●

Forecast compliance with bank financial covenants
Goodwill impairment tests
Valuation of land and buildings

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material
misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made
subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits,
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other
matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of the financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall Group materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out above. These,
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit, the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.

How we tailored our group audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting
processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The materiality levels applied in the full scope audits of the New Zealand and Australian businesses
were calculated by reference to a portion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the
business concerned (New Zealand), or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes
where the statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation (Australia).
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to
the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of
the financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as the
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements, as a whole,
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the

Corporate governance statement
As at 31 December 2022
At Seeka we conduct our business safely and ethically within the legal and regulatory framework so we can deliver the best outcomes for our growers,
clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.
Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the recommendations in the NZX Corporate
Governance Code, 17 June 2022 (the Code). Our practices are set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews Seeka's
corporate governance structures against the eight principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures
substantially meet Code recommendations. Any exceptions are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 91 of this annual report.
Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.
The Board approved this governance statement on 23 February 2023.

Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
followed throughout the organisation.”
Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory, and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.
Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”
Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are promoted
to staff each year at staff meetings. The code outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and model
high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”
The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:
• Conflicts of interest
• Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property
• Conduct, valuing individuals' differences and respecting all stakeholders
• Dealing with gifts or gratuities
• Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing
• Compliance with laws and Seeka policies
• Managing breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics
Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy that applies to the Seeka team of directors, officers, senior managers and all employees, that prohibits
team members from direct or indirect dealing in Seeka financial products when holding inside information, plus a duty of confidentiality that protects
the dissemination and use of confidential company information.
The Insider Trading Policy defines black-out periods during which restricted persons (defined below) are prohibited from trading in Seeka shares
unless provided with a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to, and finishes the first trading day after, key
events; being the half-year and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares.
Restricted persons includes all directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts
and companies controlled by such persons, and advisors. The policy also specifies that Seeka team members should not engage in short-term trading.
Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chair of the Board, and the chair must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.
No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.

Principle 2. Board composition and performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”
Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interests of the company, to deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

Main contents
Governance

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board Charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the duties
and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:
• Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards
• Compliance with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) and NZX Listing Rules
• Establishing corporate objectives and strategies
• Meeting obligations under environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles
• Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies
• Overseeing high standards of ethical behaviour
• Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance
• Managing risk to Seeka’s business
• Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication
The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.

Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth to
be appointed between annual shareholder meetings for Board succession planning. This occurred on 1 September 2021, when Robert Farron was
appointed to the Board.
At the annual shareholders meeting held 22 April 2022, Robert Farron and Stewart Moss were elected by shareholders, and John Burke and Amiel
Diaz retired, at which point the Board reverted to seven directors.
Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at
least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between governance and management, all directors are non-executive
and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.
Seeka’s Board is led by the independent chair Fred Hutchings. Non-independent director Amiel Diaz (retired 22 April 2022) was the only director
residing overseas. Since 22 April 2022, the Board has a majority of independent directors.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.
Two directors that served on the Board in 2022 were appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;
• Ratahi Cross is a representative of Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chair of the Ngai Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit
grower supplying Seeka, and
• Amiel Diaz (retired 22 April 2022), was a representative of Seeka’s shareholder Sumifru Singapore Pte Limited.
As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Four directors that served
on the Board in 2022 have extensive experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their extensive interests in kiwifruit orchards that
supply Seeka were considered non-independent directors;
• Martyn Brick
• Ratahi Cross
• John Burke (retired 22 April 2022), and
• Stewart Moss (elected 22 April 2022)

The Board has four independent directors;
• Fred Hutchings, Board chair and Remuneration Committee chair
• Robert Farron, Audit and Risk Committee chair (since 21 March 2022)
• Cecilia Tarrant, Sustainability Committee chair, and
• Ashley Waugh (Audit and Risk Committee chair, up to 21 March 2022)

Director appointments and induction
As required, the chair establishes a Nominations Committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.
Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the Group’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
Board.
The chair undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the Nominations
Committee and external advisors.

While there is no maximum term, the Board annually reviews director length of service and any potential impact on director independence. When
the Board recommends the re-election of a director whom has served longer than 12 years, it will explain to shareholders its rationale for supporting
re-election.
At the April 2022 annual shareholders meeting, two directors retired; Amiel Diaz, having served 12 years, and John Burke, having served ten years.

Director profiles
Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 92 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 94 of this annual report.

Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.
The Board works to optimise diversity across directors, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity in culture
and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key clients,
creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns. Notably Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is a lecturer in
Māori history, and Martyn Brick, Stewart Moss, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural backgrounds.

Professional development
Directors are supported to undertake professional development through individual training and by attending relevant courses.

Evaluation of board, committee and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chair undertakes an annual review of Board, committee and director performance. The chair's 2022 review found
that the Board, committees and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified by the Board
Charter.

Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”
The Board has three permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance functions, while
retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.
All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the Audit and Risk, Sustainability, Remuneration, and Nominations Committee Charters biennially.

Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board, except during succession planning when an eighth director may be appointed until the
next annual shareholders meeting, at which point the Board reverts to seven directors. To provide effective and transparent committee governance,
while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent director, with
committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill set. The Audit and Risk Committee
Charter specifies a majority of independent directors.
The current standing committees and their members are:

making.

Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”
Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a midyear performance update, along with regular operational updates to growers.
Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chair of the Board, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for
identifying material information between Board meetings. At every Board meeting the Board considers whether its deliberations and decisions trigger
a need for a disclosure to the NZX.
As stewards of more than 3,900 hectares of orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and
international guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P
standard for good agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food.
See www.globalgap.org.
Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Governance

In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit returns;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.
Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual financial statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides
management support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational
performance for their fruit.
Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. Seeka also considers environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the market any environmental factors that may
materially affect operations.
Seeka's Sustainability Committee provides strategic guidance on its environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework, targets, measures and
performance. Since 2020, Seeka has been reporting its ESG initiatives in the annual and interim reports, and in June 2022 Seeka published its first
stand-alone sustainability report.
Seeka's 2022 Sustainability Report details Seeka's journey to be a sustainable business and Seeka's aim to be net zero carbon by 2050, and an
employer of choice that provides excellent service to Seeka customers while supporting the wellbeing of our communities.
Seeka began measuring emissions in 2019 using the Ministry for the Environment's carbon footprint workbook, before calculating its 2020 and 2021
footprint using the internationally recognised standard ISO 14064-1: 2018 - Greenhouse gases, with the results verified by Toitū. Using this data, Seeka
has a platform to understand its impact on the environment, identify key areas of emissions, and define three intensity-based performance indicators;
tonnes CO2e per $1 million of revenue, per 100,000 class 1 trays packed, and per permanent employee.
The report publishes Seeka's total and intensity-based CO2e emissions since 2019, and the progress of multiple carbon-reduction initiatives. Along
with environmental sustainability, the report also updates stakeholders on Seeka's social sustainability programmes and ESG governance processes,
including climate change risk and opportunity analysis.
Starting from 2022, yearly sustainability reports are scheduled to be published each June.

Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chair uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration within
a two year period, with shareholders approving any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in April 2022, when
the pool limit was set at $610,000 per annum. As part of Board succession planning, the Board had eight directors up until the 22 April 2022 annual
shareholders meeting, after which the Board reverted to seven directors. Due to this temporary increase in the number of directors the total fees paid
exceeded the pool limit by $14,434, as permitted under NZX Rule 2.11.
As determined by the Board, the directors are remunerated by a base director fee, a Board chair fee, and chair or membership fees for three Board
committees as per the following schedule that was presented to shareholders in April 2022. The total Board chair fee will not exceed $140,000,
irrespective of whether the chair would otherwise be eligible for committee fees.

Chief executive officer remuneration
The review of the chief executive officer’s remuneration is undertaken by the remuneration committee with the remuneration package the
responsibility of the Board. Michael Franks was appointed chief executive officer in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual
remuneration that covers base salary, vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.
The following table reports chief executive officer remuneration for 2022.

Performance incentive
The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 73% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set by the Board,
including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For FY22, the chief executive officer earned no performance
incentive (FY21 - $470,063, paid December 2021).
Employee share scheme
In April 2022, the chief executive officer paid $4.09 per share ($32,720 total payment) for 8,000 shares that vested from the 2019 employee share
scheme (April 2019 issue price $4.76 per share). The chief executive has no further interest in any employee share scheme, and there is no current
scheme.

Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”
The Board considers risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific
focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.
While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
Principles and Guidelines.
Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
performance against budget and forecasts.
Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post harvest processing and fruit handling facilities.

ANNUAL REPORT 2022 | SEEKA LIMITED

Main contents
Governance

The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian produce handling and
marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia (when practicable with regard to Covid-19 travel restrictions) to
ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.
The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated
with being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing
revenue from more points along the value chain.
The following summarises the key material risks which the Board have identified and the associated mitigation strategies.

Health and safety
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.
Under Board direction, Seeka has a Covid-19 response committee to protect our people and prepare our business. Seeka worked with health
professionals, secured personal protective equipment, and used social distancing protocols to mitigate risk and keep our people safe as we deliver an
essential service. This includes onsite personnel temperature logging, touchless signing in, the provision of personal protective equipment, two-metre
screening, enlarged break areas, 24-hour cleaning and remote management. Seeka continued operations during the 2022 Omicron outbreak.

Our people work in multiple, complex environments, and we focus on building safety into everything we do. This included instilling Seeka's safety
culture as we amalgamated OPAC and Orangewood in FY21, and NZ Fruits in FY22. Over the full year, the Group employed more than 6,500 people,
with Group salary and wages equating to 2,396 full time equivalents.

1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of hours worked.
TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
2. Permanently disabled or requiring immediate in-patient hospitalisation.

Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”
Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the market
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.
The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit
process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk committee:
• Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and
• Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.
For FY22, Troy Florence of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) completed his second year as external auditor for the Group.
PwC has confirmed its independence to the audit and risk committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the reporting period.
PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.
In FY22, PwC was paid $529,000 for audit fees and expenses, $12,000 for tax compliance and consulting, $12,000 for tax pooling services and
$7,000 for debt covenant compliance certificate agreed upon procedures.

Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
external audit findings.
Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated financial audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s financial systems.
Directors also consider matters raised by PwC, the external auditor.

Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”
Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering excellence to all stakeholders.
The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
• Annual and interim reports
• Annual sustainability report
• Market announcements
• Annual shareholder meeting
• Mid-year stakeholder meeting
• Ad-hoc investor presentations
• Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type
• Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors
• Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team

Governance

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update either in person or online, where
they can raise matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which affect Seeka at the annual
shareholder meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the company’s auditor PwC, on a
one share, one vote principle.
Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar
Link Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. Notices of shareholder meetings are posted on the NZX website and Seeka's website. Where
circumstances allow, Seeka sends notices of shareholder meetings at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements
can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.
When raising new capital, where practical, the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company on a pro
rata basis so they can maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.
Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK.

differences, these have been approved by the Board.

Concerning
2.8 A majority of the board
should be independent
directors.

Key difference

Period of
non compliance

The Constitution and Board Charter specify a minimum of two independent
directors.

From 1 January to
22 April 2022

As Seeka's foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers it appropriate
to have a mix of directors with extensive experience in kiwifruit production
and handling, who in the normal course of business would supply Seeka
with produce from their ongoing orcharding interests. The Board must also
appropriately represent large shareholders.
The specified minimum of two independent directors provides the flexibility
to meet these two criteria, while also ensuring Board decisions reflect the best
interests of Seeka and its security holders.
From 1 January to 22 April 2022, only four out of eight directors (even split)
were deemed independent, with four non-independent; two for their extensive
interests in orchards that supply Seeka (industry expertise), one an appointee
of a large shareholder (market expertise), and one that has extensive interests
in orchards that supply Seeka as well as being an appointee of a large
shareholder (industry expertise).
Since 22 April 2022, Seeka complies with the Code with four out of seven
directors deemed independent (a majority).

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

The Nominations Committee Charter allows for the formation of an adhoc committee as required. To manage workload across the Board, the
Nominations Committee Charter requires an independent chair.

At all relevant
times

On 2 February 2022, Seeka issued 1,687,860 new ordinary shares as partial
consideration for the acquisition of the shares in New Zealand Fruits Limited
by amalgamation. The Board considered this issue of Seeka shares was an
effective method to secure the acquisition by amalgamation, which would
benefit Seeka, including by further strengthening Seeka's alignment with
growers.

Remuneration includes key performance indicator payments. Remuneration by the Group’s Australian subsidiary Seeka Australia in Australian dollars
was converted to New Zealand dollars using the average exchange rate for the year. The impact of movements in exchange rates from FY21 to FY22
was reviewed and would not have significantly changed the employee remuneration disclosure.

Employee share scheme
As part of their employment benefits, eligible permanent employees are invited to participate in Seeka’s employee share ownership scheme. The 2019
employee share ownership scheme had 568,000 shares allocated to permanent employees at $4.76 per share. These shares vested in April 2022.
