Seeka's Business Profile and Strategy
Profile and strategy
Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited (Seeka) is founded on being an integrated orcharding, post harvest, supply and retail
services company. Our strategy is to concentrate on our kiwifruit foundation while extending our business into other
produce sectors that complement our core competencies. Our vision is to be New Zealand’s Premier Produce Company
and our strategy may see Seeka extending its geographical boundaries and result in acquisitions or alliances that
profitably complement our existing capabilities. Seeka aims to deliver its shareholders returns higher than the average of
the NZX50 and improve the financial wellbeing of all our stakeholders.

New Zealand orcharding and post harvest services
Seeka’s orcharding business grows kiwifruit, avocados and kiwiberries on more than 800 hectares of orchards through
managed, leased and long-term lease arrangements with orchard and land owners. Operations extend from the East Cape
though the Bay of Plenty and Coromandel to Northland with orcharding services delivered through a networked team of
professional orchard managers and contractors who are experts in growing all varieties of kiwifruit.
Seeka’s post-harvest business harvests, packs and coolstores approximately 28m trays of kiwifruit, avocados and
kiwiberries each season. Seeka has eight packing and coolstore facilities located in the Bay of Plenty, Coromandel and
Northland. Volumes are increasing.
Using advanced inventory management systems, Seeka's coordinates fruit loadout so it is delivered to the consumer in
premium condition. Our knowledge base is underpinned by our own inhouse technical team and laboratory operation
(VLS) which provide growers and post-harvest management with optimal information on fruit maturity and quality.
Seeka’s business includes the management of Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited; grower-controlled entities
that manage and distribute Seeka-supplying grower funds through separate legal companies. Seeka Growers Limited
and AvoFresh Limited are independently audited and provide growers with clear separation of their monies from Seeka's
commercial operations.

New Zealand Retail services
Retail services, which encompasses Seeka's supply operations, covers the distribution and marketing of all non-Zesprisupplied export kiwifruit, including collaborative marketing agreements, along with avocado and kiwiberry export
operations. Retail services also imports, ripens and distributes tropical fruits and bananas under agency for Sumifru.
Our retail services enable Seeka to deliver orchardists and international clients a full orchard-to-market service for an
expanding range of products. It attracts new grower clients, improves post-harvest asset utilisation and diversifies Seeka’s
revenue streams.

Seeka Australia
Seeka Australia (Pty) Limited (Seeka Australia) is a wholly-owned subsidiary that following an acquisition in August
2015, owns 505 hectares of land adjacent to Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. Approximately 250 hectares is in producing
orchards. Seeka Australia grows, packs and markets all produce from the land, and is the largest producer of Australiangrown kiwifruit and nashi pears with approximately 200 hectares in these two main crops and a further 50 hectares in
apricots, pears, plums and cherries.

Report of the Chairman and Chief Executive

Overview
Seeka is pleased to present its audited financial results for the year ended 31 December, 2015. This year's growth in
revenue and profits is consistent with strategy. The key components of that growth include:
• Another year of strong orchard recovery from the devastating impact of Psa-V particularly the Zespri SunGold ( G3)
variety.
• Strategically planned diversification of Seeka’s business in Australia and New Zealand and by applying our expertise
to additional fresh produce lines.
• The purchase and integration of the business of Bunbartha Fruit Packers, now Seeka Australia, in the last quarter of
the year.
On 4 March 2015 a fire at Oakside our largest packhouse facility caused significant operational disruption two weeks
before the kiwifruit picking season commenced. Additionally the fire caused considerable downstream impact on load out
plans and fruit storage. A number of insurance claims were lodged with insurers for losses and costs arising from this fire.
Not all claims were finalised and accepted by the insurers at year end.
Net profit after tax of $4.27m is ahead of guidance released to the market of between $2.96m and $3.53m (the range in
the forecast/guidance was partly due to the uncertainty of pending insurance claims).

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Introduction
Seeka is in a period of strong growth. Revenue of $142.11m is up 22.9% on the pcp. Seeka records its agency commission
as revenue when we sell produce on behalf of customers. Turnover was $184.74m (up 24.3% on the pcp) when the value
of all fruit sold is recorded as turnover.
Profitability continues to improve. New Zealand kiwifruit volumes are increasing after the devastating effects of Psa-V.
Seeka’s packed volumes increased to 27.8 million trays, compared to 21.4 million trays in the pcp. After-tax profit was
$4.27m, up from $3.17m in the pcp.
Results exceed expectation but were affected by a net $0.32m of insurance-related costs and $1.12m transactional
and stamp duty costs associated with the acquisition of Seeka Australia. The net insurance costs included a grower
relationship payment of $4.04m for growers to ensure they were fairly compensated for their fruit while Seeka worked
through the insurance process. At 31 December, aspects of the insurance claim are still in progress.
Seeka Australia was purchased on a crop-off basis, meaning we spent $4.53m by year end growing the crops for harvest
2016.
Earnings per share of $0.29 was up 32% on the pcp’s $0.22. The company issued 738,950 shares under the grower share
scheme and 60,364 shares under the dividend reinvestment programme. Net asset backing of $4.34 per share was also
up on the prior period’s $4.07. The closing share price was $3.45.
Seeka has increased debt by $33.99m to finance infrastructure expansion in New Zealand to handle increasing kiwifruit
volumes and to finance the purchase of Seeka Australia.
Seeka invested $16.39m in New Zealand plant and equipment, compared to $5.64m in the pcp. New Zealand
infrastructure will expand further in 2016 to ensure sufficient capacity to process fruit at its optimum time. Seeka has
purchased land adjacent to the Transpac facility for long-term development and head office premises.
Seeka invested NZD$20.16m in its Australian acquisition, with further deferred payments of AUD$5.00m due in 2016. Full
investment details are outlined later in this report. The company has expensed transaction costs and stamp duty totalling
$1.12m. Benefits of the acquisition are anticipated in the 2016 financial results.
The company continues to build shareholder wealth and increase dividends. In total $0.19 in dividends were paid or
declared per share, compared to $0.16 last year. It was nil four years ago.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Strategy
Seeka’s vision is to be New Zealand’s premier produce business, a natural development on our kiwifruit platform. Seeka
is on a growth path, both in size and profitability and is taking a long-term view. The company aims to deliver returns
superior to the NZX50 at a total shareholder return level and will:
• Build on activities where it has competency and performance - things it is good at.
• Strive to make value accretive investments in the perspective of our shareholders.
• Pursue vertically integrated opportunities where it is able and deliver higher returns to stakeholders.
• Strive to be a company that is safe and people focused.
Seeka may contemplate acquisitions where they meet the criteria of the Board. The company aspires to grow its market
capitalisation to $200m, compared to $61m today and $18m when the strategy was initiated.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Review of post harvest and supply operations
Seeka’s post-harvest and supply operations comprise the planning and operation of harvest, packing, coolstore, logistics
and supply operations for kiwifruit, avocados and kiwiberry. Operations have two functional general managers covering
planning and supply and post-harvest operations.
The industry share of Hayward held constant at 24%, while Gold increased from 10% to 14% and is anticipated to
increase again in 2016.
Seeka packed 27.8 million trays of kiwifruit, up from 21.4 million trays in the pcp. Growth in Zespri SunGold volumes
continues to surge with 3.88 million trays packed in 2015, up from 1.2 million trays in the pcp. Seeka packed 351,000 trays
of avocados and 39,000 trays of kiwiberry.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Operations were put under extreme pressure by the Oakside facility fire immediately prior to harvest. The team had to
focus on site remediation with the support of contractors. Harvest went smoothly but by the end of packing it became
apparent that Hayward fruit processed at Oakside was softer and was softening quicker than fruit processed at other
facilities. Gold fruit was unaffected.
Seeka notified insurers of a potential claim for extraordinary fruit loss as a consequence of the fire. Adjusters, appointed
by the insurer, Zespri and Seeka, put in place a mitigation plan to minimise loss. This plan saw Seeka priority-load the fruit
from Oakside. While Seeka largely mitigated the losses associated with the Oakside-processed fruit, it did incur losses
in delaying fruit shipped from other sites. The insurance claim for Oakside-processed fruit has been accepted by the
insurers, and the claim for the mitigation losses is still being assessed.
In order to protect Seeka's growers from the potential impact on income and cash flow, Seeka paid them $4.04m ahead of
any insurance outcome. The $4.04m has been expensed in 2015 and recovery from insurance, if any, will be recorded as
income in 2016.
Excluding the $4.04m grower payment, EBITDA from post-harvest would have been $17.33m, including the grower
payment EBITDA is $13.29m. This compares to $10.77m in the pcp.
Companies define their relationship with their customers and stakeholders by how they behave and respond when things
go wrong. Seeka reacted positively for its growers and stakeholders and stood behind them. As at 31 December, Seeka's
Hayward growers were forecast to receive $4.95 in orchard gate returns per tray, which is slightly above the industry
forecast average of $4.87 per tray. The Gold crop was not involved in the insurance issue.
The fire and mitigation strategy were extraordinary events that placed significant pressure on staff, growers and suppliers.
The company has worked through the issues and is positioned positively for 2016. The insurance process remains open
and active.
Seeka continues to revise its team structure as production levels increase, with more than fifteen roles created in its postharvest and supply teams to ensure the company has the right people, trained in the right roles with clear accountabilities
ahead of the next season.
Capital investment of approximately $13.37m is underway on coolstore capacity expansion at KKP, Maketu and Main
Road in Katikati. In the process, Seeka is maximising land ownership at strategic packhouse sites and balancing the
coolstore infrastructure with anticipated packing volumes.
There are significant other capital investments underway, including an additional 9,000 plastic Seeka S600 bins. These
bins are superior to wooden bins; they protect fruit, provide a lower damage profile from orchard to the packing machine,
and provide operational efficiencies to picking contractors.
The combination of people, infrastructure expansion and new bins has set up our packhouse sites well to manage the
expected crop volumes next season.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Review of orchard division performance
Orchard operations handle all growing and orchard management services for the company’s orchards (managed, owned
and leased). Operations cover the growing of kiwifruit, avocados and kiwiberry across Seeka’s catchment from Northland
to the East Cape.
EBITDA from orchard operations of $3.98m compares to $4.18m in the pcp. In total 9.2m trays of kiwifruit were grown by
orchard division compared to 7.2m trays in the pcp.
While market returns remain firm, they have reduced from the highs of the previous year. This and increasing on-orchard
costs have suppressed the division’s earnings. Seeka continues to invest in leased Gold orchards and long-term lease
orchards are still returning to full production. Yields and production are expected to lift when orchards achieve full
maturity.
Forecast Hayward orchard gate returns averaged $4.95 per tray, compared to $5.96 in the pcp and a forecast Zespri
industry average of $4.87; SunGold was $8.22 per tray, compared to $10.40 in the pcp and a forecast Zespri industry
average of $8.14.
Overall yields from the division were excellent. Hayward yields across the 8.0 million trays grown were an astonishing
11,626 trays per hectare compared to a record industry average of 11,044 trays per hectare. Gold orchards [G3] averaged
8,858 per hectare, less than two-thirds of their final targeted production.
Seeka is investing in the next generation of orchard managers, recruiting six cadets as trainee orchard managers. These
cadets are part of a structured training programme that will see them achieve a tertiary qualification and a career pathway
in horticulture.

Retail services
Seeka’s retail services handle all non-Zespri kiwifruit sales from New Zealand, kiwifruit sales under collaborative
marketing, avocado sales and Seeka's kiwiberry sales. It also handles the integrated supply line for imported fruit and fruit
supplied to the New Zealand domestic market including the agency for Sumifru and the importation of their bananas. This
business includes ripening and retail service operations in Auckland and Christchurch, and an Auckland wholesale market.
EBITDA of $1.73m compares to $1.77m in the pcp. The banana ripening and distribution business was behind expectation
at the end of the first six months due to global supply issues. The volumes returned to normal during the second six
months, with earnings returning to expectation.
The business established important new domestic supply programmes in 2015 to the benefit of our supplying growers.
Direct-to-retail programmes were initiated for Hayward and Gold kiwifruit, in addition to a new programme for avocados.
These are the first direct-to-retail programmes undertaken by Seeka in the domestic market. They performed well
delivering an incremental return to growers and excellent quality to customers.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Seeka Australia
In August 2015, Seeka announced the purchase of the business and assets of Bunbartha Fruit Packers and established
Seeka Australia Pty Limited. The AUD$22m purchase included an unconditional deferred settlement of AUD$5m to
occur in 2016. The purchase was completed on a crop-off basis with Seeka to grow the 2016 crop. Seeka had invested
NZD$4.53m growing that crop at balance date. The purchase price was completed with 100% debt financing.
The purchase includes approximately 505 hectares of land at Shepparton, of which approximately 250 hectares is in
productive orchards. The primary crops include approximately 100 hectares of kiwifruit and a hundred hectares of nashi
pears, with the remaining in apricots, European pears, plums and cherries.
The company purchased 1,534 water shares on acquisition and during the year invested a further $0.51m to ensure
sufficient water for the current year along with some buffer for future orchard expansion.
Seeka has integrated the operational side of the business establishing management, financial, safety and human resources
systems into the company. The people who transferred to Seeka Australia on purchase are experienced orcharding
professionals. Seeka will move to integrate the sales process through the first half of 2016.
There is scope for significant expansion and improvements in the operations. Seeka anticipates EBITDA of between
NZD$3.2m and $4.0m in the first harvest year. It is a significant step for the company consistent with the stated strategy
for Seeka.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Safety and Compliance
The safety of our people and suppliers remains a primary focus for Seeka. People who work at Seeka, or who visit our
sites and orchards must do so in a safe environment and manner. We continue to challenge the behaviours of our people
and suppliers. Seeka has established a compliance team to work with our network of contractors to reinforce safety as
a feature of normal work practice and to ensure they comply with employment legislation. As a result our company has
delivered a good safety profile as illustrated by a lost time frequency rate of 0.90 lost hours per 100,000 hours worked.
Seeka had two notifiable serious harm injuries in 2015, both preventable. While at the lower end of serious harm, the
incidents themselves were disappointing. Further enhancements were made to our safety policies as a result of these
incidents. Seeka tracks all near miss accidents and regularly audits and reviews operations for safety compliance and
safety targets are included in key performance indicators across the business.

People
Seeka continues to refine its structure, and support and develop our people. The company has intensively recruited in the
last six months of the year to rebuild competency necessarily removed through the downturn of Psa-V.
Importantly the Company has recruited cadets.
During the year, Murray Judd left the company seeking a lifestyle change. Murray has been with Seeka for more than 10
years, providing thoughtful insight, research, suggestions and technical advice that have delivered improved financial
outcomes for the company and its growers. While Murray has retired, he is consulting and remains contracted to Seeka.
Thank you, Murray.
It is people that make a good company great. We thank senior management for their leadership, all employees for their
hard work and commitment to the company, and its stakeholders throughout a very challenging and busy year.

Grower share scheme
This is the second year of the three-year grower share scheme introduced in 2014 to respond to fierce competition in
the kiwifruit post harvest business for fruit supply following the outbreak of Psa-V. The scheme offered facilitated share
ownership to growers who committed their entire orchard crop for the three years of the scheme.
This year 738,950 shares ( 2014: 605,152) were allocated to qualifying growers at a cost of $3.37 each (2014: $3.05) and
a total cost of $2.49m (2014: $1.85m).

12

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Outlook
Seeka has significantly increased its profit and size during the year. The immediate outlook for growth remains positive as
Seeka concentrates on expanding New Zealand facilities to handle higher kiwifruit volumes, completes the integration of
Seeka Australia and improves orchard productivity in Australia. The company holds to its strategy and vision, and remains
watchful and ready to make further steps to realise any opportunities aligned to strategy should they arise.
Directors and management thank contractors and suppliers for their service and support. We thank our supplying
growers for their continuing loyalty. We compliment shareholders for their support and the interest that they show in their
company.

Basis of Preparation
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements.
Accounting policies which are limited to a specific note, are described in that note.

Reporting entity and statutory base

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation

Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited is a profit-orientated company
registered in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and
an FMC Reporting Entity for the purposes of the Financial Markets
Conduct Act 2013. Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited is listed and
its ordinary shares are quoted on the NZX main board equity
security market (NZX Main Board).

Nature of operations

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the FMC Act
2013. In accordance with the FMC Act 2013, separate financial
statements for the parent Company are no longer required to be
prepared and presented, as the financial statements are prepared
for the Group. The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to
International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other
applicable financial reporting standards as appropriate for profitoriented entities . The Group financial statements also comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and
Australia.

The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis,
with the exception of:

The financial statements presented are those of Seeka Kiwifruit
Industries Limited (the Company) together with its subsidiaries (the
Group, Seeka or Seeka Group).

In New Zealand the Group provides orcharding, post harvest and
retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry
industries. The Group also provides retail and ripening services for
imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale market.
In Australia, following a 2015 acquisition of land, orchards and
business assets, the Group became the largest single producer and
supplier of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of
European pears, plus lesser production of other temperate-climate
fruits.

• financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments)
at fair value through the profit or loss (note 30 and 31)
• biological assets at fair value (note 11)
• land and buildings at the revaluation model (note 9)
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of
the financial statements are set out below.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors
(the Board) on 26 February 2016.

19

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition,
being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue
to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The
financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same
reporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting
policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains
and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends
are eliminated in full.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on
transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Critical accounting estimates
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future
operational and financial performance. By definition, these
assumptions may not always equal actual results. The estimates
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are
identified in the notes below. Estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as
adjusted for current market conditions and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Assumptions underlying management’s
estimates can be found in the following notes to the financial
statements.

Foreign currency transactions

Area of estimation

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing during the month of
that transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income
statement.

Property, plant and equipment

9

Goodwill

10

Biological assets

11

Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of
which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the
Group are translated at the closing rate at the date of that
balance sheet;
• Income and expenses for each entity's income statement and
statement of other comprehensive income, are translated
at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income
and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the
transactions); and
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other
comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences
arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.

20

Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used
and are relevant to the understanding of the financial statements
are provided throughout the accompanying notes. The accounting
policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout
the periods presented in these financial statements. Certain
comparative information has been reclassified to conform with
the current year’s presentation. There are no new standards,
amendments or interpretations that have been issued and effective,
that are expected to have a significant impact on the Group.

Note

Going concern assumption
The Group reported a profit before tax of $5.25m (2014: $4.26m)
and operating cash inflows of $1.80m (2014: 8.53m) for the year
ended 31 December 2015. As at 31 December 2015 the Group
had net assets of $70.82m (2014: 63.19m).
The ability of the Group to remain in compliance with its bank
covenants has been considered by the Board in the adoption of
the going concern assumption during the preparation of these
financial statements. The Board forecasts that the Group can trade
at levels appropriate to meet its bank covenants for the 2016
financial year.
In doing so they have considered forecast information, the security
of bank funding, and any potential impact on ongoing crop supply
including Psa-V.

Goods and services tax (GST)
The statement of financial performance and statement of
comprehensive income has been prepared so that all components
are stated exclusive of GST. All items in the statement of financial
position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables
and payables, which include GST invoiced.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015
Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the
individual operating segments.

Note 1. Segment Information
The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in
business activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are
reported in a manner consistent with the internal reports provided
to the chief decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly
evaluate the allocation of resources alongside operational
outcomes and are responsible for implementing strategic
decisions.

Post harvest operations

The Group has five operating segments:

The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and
internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets.
This includes product from the Group’s orchard and post harvest
operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported produce, and operates a wholesale
market.

• Four New Zealand segments express the range of
complementary services delivered to New Zealand’s produce
industries.
• A single Australian segment encompasses the integrated
business associated with the Group’s Australian-grown
produce.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to
each segment. Administration costs, overheads and grower service
costs are allocated to all other segments. Transactions between
segments are conducted at arms length and are eliminated on
consolidation.
New Zealand segments
Orchard operations
The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.

The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado
and kiwiberry industries. This includes all product from the Group’s
orchard management and lease operations, plus product from
independent orchard owners.
Retail service operations

All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower
services and overhead sections along with impairments and
revaluations of other assets not attributed directly to any other
segment.
Australian operations
The Group owns and operates Australian orchards, provides post
harvest operations and markets the produce from those orchards,
primarily in Australia. The main fruit grown by the group are
kiwifruit, nashi pears and European pears.

The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
• Leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts) whereby
the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
orchard owners.
• Leased land (long term contracts) which the Group has
developed into productive orchards, pays all development and
production costs, and owns all crops for the term of the lease.

Turnover
Turnover (a non-GAAP measure) includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers where the Group acts as the
agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. (See note 2).

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability
and reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and
suppliers where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both
local and export.

Revenue is shown net of discounts, which includes the $2.49m

details).

Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are linked to the seasonal nature of horticultural
operations, with post harvest revenues generated as services are
provided once the fruit is harvested, and orcharding and retail
revenues once it is sold. In New Zealand kiwifruit are harvested
from March to June, avocados from August to January, and
kiwiberries from February to March. In Australia nashi and
European pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit
from March to May.

Oakside fire - insurance proceeds for asset loss
On 4 March a fire at the Group's Oakside facility destroyed an
ancillary packhouse and caused damage to an office space and
a number of coolstore buildings and associated plant, all part
of post harvest operations. The Group is fully insured for loss on
assets and also business interruption. The loss on the asset claim
has been accepted by the Group insurers NZI, QBE and AIG. At
balance date the minimum value of insurance recoveries for the
loss of property and business interruption is $5.46m, of which the
Group has received $2.48m, recognised as other income in the
statement of financial performance. The value of the claim will be
finalised when the asset rebuild is completed in 2016.

Grower incentive scheme
In response to industry-wide crop loss from the kiwifruit vine
disease Psa, in 2013 the Group initiated a grower incentive
scheme to secure post harvest volumes for harvests 2014, 2015
and 2016. Eligible growers that joined the scheme committed
to supply all kiwifruit and kiwiberry crops from their orchards up
to and including harvest 2016. In return, when each season's
supply obligation is met (in September) the Company issues
each complying grower with $0.10 worth of shares for every
tray supplied that season. Shares are issued at the NZX volume
weighted average price (VWAP) of shares prior to the issue.
For accounting purposes, the Group recognises:
• the expense as a discount to sales from post harvest revenue in
the statement of financial performance, and
• the value of issued shares as share capital.

Accounting policies

Retail service revenue

Revenue comprises the fair value received for the sale of goods
and services, net of goods and services tax (GST), rebates and
discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.

Ripening and delivery services, and fruit sales to key retail
customers - revenue is recognised as services are provided on a
principal or agency basis depending on who bears the risks and
rewards.

Orchard revenue
Managed orchards - revenue is invoiced and recognised as
earned for orcharding services provided to managed orchards
supplying the Group.
Leased orchards - crop revenue is recognised in the statement of
financial performance at harvest based on forecast orchard gate
returns (OGRs) with a corresponding increase in the statement
of financial position. The proceeds are then received over the 12
month period following harvest. Revenue estimates are updated at
balance date.
Post harvest revenue
From fruit packing, coolstorage and other supply-chain activities.
Services peak from April to December with the bulk of revenues
collected by end November. Revenue is recognised as services are
provided.

Fruit marketing and wholesale market sales programmes
(domestic and international) - the Group acts as an agent and
collects a commission on sales with revenue recognised when the
produce is sold.
Collaborative marketing programmes (the Group purchases fruit
from Zespri International for sale in agreed international markets
under licence from Kiwifruit New Zealand) - revenue is recognised
when the produce is sold.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the
effective interest method.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment
is established.

Grower relationship payment - fruit loss
On 4 March a fire at the Group's Oakside packhouse destroyed
part of the facility and caused damage to an ancillary packhouse,
office space and a number of coolstore buildings and associated
plant, all part of post harvest operations. Seeka and its growers
suffered extraordinary fruit softening and loss as the result of
the fire and the strategy put in place to mitigate fruit loss at that
site. While the strategy was successful, growers still suffered
extraordinary financial loss that is the subject of a further insurance
claim by Seeka Growers Limited for the value of the fruit lost. This

Accounting policies
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of financial
performance as incurred, except where a future economic benefit
arises and they are recorded as prepayment.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of
ownership are retained by the Group are classified as operating leases.
Operating leases include short term orchard leases. Payments

the lessor) are charged to the statement of financial performance

claim has partly been agreed, but a substantial portion is still in
the process of evaluation by their Insurance underwriters. Seeka
considered it important to stand by its growers while they worked
through the detailed insurance process and has advanced $4.04m
to Seeka Growers Limited (the grower pool) so as to maintain its
on-going relationship and goodwill with its growers and minimise
the risk of grower loss. In doing so, it was agreed that the advance
will only be repaid to Seeka as a priority charge from any further
insurance proceeds that Seeka Growers Limited receives from the
active insurance claim should the claim be accepted.
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease, except for
short term orchard leases where lease costs are recognised at the
same time as other crop related income and expenses.
Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits
and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the
reporting date are recognised in other payables in respect of
employees' services up to the reporting date and are measured at
the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the
leave is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date, and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax loses of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit.
Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value
on a three-year rolling cycle by TelferYoung Valuers, ANZIV,
independent registered valuer as at 31 December 2015 (excludes
assets under construction and those damaged by the Oakside fire).
Subsequent additions are at cost.
Valuations are undertaken by an independent valuer using
inherently subjective techniques that include estimations.
The valuer considers three different approaches in concert to arrive
at a fair value;

1. Replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the
replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements
based on the current cost of construction less depreciation
based on the age of the building with an allowance for
physical depreciation (2%). Specific consideration is given to
the 'optimised depreciated replacement cost' methodology.
2. Sales - considers sales of other comparable properties.
3. Investment - assumes a hypothetical lease of the property with
a current market rental being established and capitalising
this at an appropriate rate of return (8 - 15%) that would be
expected by a prudent investor.

Impairment
On 4 March 2015, the Group's Oakside facility suffered a fire which led to the destruction or damage to an ancillary packhouse and
office, and a number of coolstore buildings and associated plant, all of which were part of post harvest operations.
As a result the Group has a $1.74m impairment loss that has been recognised within the statement of financial performance.
The Group is fully insured for loss on assets and also business interruption. At balance date the value of insurance recoveries is estimated
to be $5.46m of which $2.48m had been received for the asset loss.

Accounting policies
Non-current assets held for sale
When it is highly probable an asset's carrying value will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than by
continued use, the asset is reclassified in the statement of financial
position as an asset held-for-sale.
A held-for-sale asset is recognised at the lower of its carrying
amount and fair value, less costs to sell.

at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying
amount of the asset and the net amount are restated to the
revalued amount of the asset.
All other property and equipment, including bearer plants, are
stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes
all costs incurred to purchase the asset.

Bearer plants

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying value or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item
will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the
statement of financial performance during the financial period in
which they are incurred.

Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear,
avocado and other fruiting trees on Group-owned and leased
land.

Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land
and buildings are accounted through comprehensive income and
other reserves.

Property, plant and equipment - including bearer plants

Depreciation

Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic,
but at least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any
subsequent improvements at cost, less subsequent depreciation
for buildings. Revaluations are performed more frequently if
changing industry conditions may cause their carrying value to
differ significantly from fair value. Any accumulated depreciation

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.

When a held-for-sale asset is no longer available for sale, or a
sale is not highly probable within 12 months of being classified as
held-for-sale, the classification is reviewed, and if appropriate the
asset reclassified as non current asset.

29

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Accounting policies - continued

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and
adjusted if appropriate, at balance date.

The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

An asset’s carrying amount is immediately written down to its
recoverable amount.

• Buildings: 20 - 50 years
• Machinery: 10 - 20 years

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing
proceeds with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is
included in the statement of financial performance. When
revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in the revaluation
reserve in respect of those assets is transferred to retained
earnings.

• Vehicles: 4 - 7 years
• Furniture, fittings and equipment: 3 - 10 years
• Bearer plants: 5 - 50 years

The amortisation period of software is four to five years and the remaining amortisation period for the interest in leased land is from 35 to
93 years.
The Group's interest in leased land occupied, or held for future development, arose on the acquisition of Huka Pak and is the difference in
the value of the lease terms to relative market terms.
Permanent water shares is an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual crops in
Australia. The fair value of permanent water shares used for impairment testing is supported by the traded price of the shares.

Impairment tests for goodwill
The Board reviews business performance based on operating segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level in
accordance with the below policy. Goodwill represents the Group's retail services acquired with Glassfields and the acquisition of Seeka
Australia (Pty) Limited.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the 5 year after-tax cash flow projection, with a terminal value beyond
5 years. Cash flows beyond the 5 year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated below. The
assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit, is determined based on
past performance and Directors' expectations of future market development. No impairment arose in the current year.
No impairment would be required if the discount rate applied was 1% higher or if the terminal growth rate was 1% lower.
The following table details the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations and the recoverable amount in 2015.

Accounting policies
Intangible assets
Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and
amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite
life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount. When assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able
to generate cash flow.
Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life (typically
three to five years).
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets
of the acquired business or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisition of a business is included in intangible
assets. Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included

in investments in associates. Goodwill acquired in business
combinations is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently if deemed prudent,
goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying
amount of goodwill relating to that entity.
Supplier contracts
When an intangible asset is recognised on a supplier contract it is
amortised over the life of the contract on a straight line basis. The
expense is charged to the statement of financial performance.
Lease interest in land
The Group’s interest in long term leased land occupied, or held
for future development, is amortised over the life of the lease and
tested for impairment on a triennial basis along with land and
buildings.
Permanent water shares
The Group records permanent water shares at cost; the shares
have an indefinite life and are not depreciated. Integral to growing
annual crops in Australia, the carrying value is tested annually
for impairment and as required, adjusted to take account of any
impairment losses.

Accounting policies
Biological assets are the crops hanging on the vines and trees in the Group's leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair
value depends on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (so long as
the costs are considered recoverable).
When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.

Non-current trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment
terms of up to five years.

Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due but not considered impaired. Debts which
are known to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.

performance.

Accounting policies
Raw materials and stores, work in progress, finished goods and fruit produce are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
comprises direct materials and direct labour, and are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sales costs.

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect
the term portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates. See Note 31.

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised
cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan
transaction cost. When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and
amortised over the period of the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after balance date.

Grower Incentive Scheme
On 7 September 2015, the Group issued 738,950 shares at a price of $3.37 each in respect of the 2015 kiwifruit supply season to
participating growers. See note 3.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares
are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

elements in ordinary shares issued during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income
tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of

The land and buildings revaluation reserve is used to record increments and decrements on the revaluation of land and buildings.
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record foreign currency translation differences on the translation of the Group entities
results and financial position. The amounts are accumulated in other comprehensive income and recognised in profit and loss when the
foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
The foreign currency revaluation reserve is used to record unrealised gains and losses on the Group's assets and liabilities held in foreign
currencies.

Share based payment reserve
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based compensation plans: a new employees share scheme that was established in 2014,
and a scheme established in 2002 that is not active and is in the process of being terminated and the surplus shares will be sold.
The active scheme is managed by a trust established in October 2014, and the directors of the trustee company (Seeka Employee Share
Plan Trustee Limited) are also Directors of Seeka.
For both employee share schemes shares are issued to an employee share trust, with certain employees eligible to subscribe to shares
held by the trust with this benefit recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At
the end of the vesting period the employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to
them, alternatively the employee can elect not to have the shares transferred to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven.

Accounting policies
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange
for the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the
statement of financial performance with a corresponding
increase in the share based payment reserve. The fair value is
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted,
calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model, excluding
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example,
profitability and sales growth targets).
When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to
those shares is transferred to share capital.
Shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set
by the Board based on the VWAP calculation of the Company's
shares during the period prior to issue. The Employee Share
Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with further shares if that issue

would result in the ESS having an interest of more than 5% of
the Company’s issued capital. Shares are issued fully paid in
exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust. Dividends paid
on the shares are applied towards repaying the debt between
the ESS and the Group on behalf of the employee.
Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are
credited to share capital when the options are exercised.
ESS has a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated
to employees. Annually the Group reviews the scheme and
decides upon the allocation of further shares and the price at
which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS are
appointed for an unspecified term and may be removed by the
Company at any time.
Shares held by the ESS carry the same voting rights as other
issued ordinary shares.

The dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the
dividend re-investment plan. Cash dividend payment was $2.52m (Dec 2014: $2.17m).
On 25 February 2016, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend will be paid 24 March to
those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 18 March, 2016. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply to the dividend. This dividend
declaration brings fully imputed dividends distributed to shareholders in the past year to $0.19 per share, compared to $0.16 per share in
2014.

Note 24. Business Combinations
Acquisition of the business of Bunbartha Fruit Packers Pty
Limited
On 4 August 2015, the Group acquired the 50% balance of Pollen
Australia Pty Limited that it did not yet own. The company was
renamed Seeka Australia Pty Limited (Seeka Australia), and on 28
August 2015, Seeka Australia acquired 100% of the orcharding
business and assets of Australian company Bunbartha Fruit Packers
Pty Limited (Bunbartha or BFP) and its associated entities for
AUD$23.3 million. Seeka and BFP are strategically aligned and
complement each other; both sell to similar customers at different
times of the year.
Since the acquisition, the Group has been integrating Australianbased selling and marketing operations, with fruit produced and
marketed by Seeka Australia broadening and complementing
Seeka’s existing offering of kiwifruit, avocados and kiwiberries.

Seeka Australia revenues of approximately NZD$17m should add
$3.2m to $4.0m to Group EBITDA; before any synergy gains from
internal optimisation and market expansion. The Group anticipates
these synergies will deliver benefits to grower stakeholders and
increase shareholder returns.
The acquired business contributed revenues of NZD$1.2m and
a net loss before interest, amortisation and depreciation of
NZD$1.4m and a loss before tax of NZD$1.5m to the Group for
the period from 28 August 2015 to balance date. If the acquisition
had occurred on 1 January 2015, contributed Group revenue
would have been approximately NZD$14.8m and estimated net
profit before tax would have been NZD$1.3m calculated using the
Group's accounting policies.

August 2015, based on an independent valuation of property, bearer plants, and water shares undertaken by Goulburn Valley Property
Services, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia.
The goodwill of $6.27m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired business, synergies to be achieved and increased
earnings.
By acquiring all shares not yet owned by the Group, Seeka established a wholly-owned Australian-based subsidiary to acquire the
business and handle debt financing. The purchase price was funded through debt facilities with AUD$17.0m paid on completion and two
further deferred payments of AUD$2.5m to be paid 15 January 2016 and 1 July 2016 respectively.
Acquisition-related costs of NZD$616,000 and NZD$504,000 stamp duty costs were expensed in the consolidated income statement.

Note 29. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to
producing and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate
financial risks related to credit, liquidity and capital risk. The
Group operates a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation
programme via its audit and risk committee.
The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value
and maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources
are available for the development of the Group’s business whilst
managing its financial risks.

a. Risk management strategies related to orchard and retail
operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production
and market returns. The main production risks are climatic events,
diseases and pests. These impact on volumes produced from
the Group's orchards, volumes to post harvest (both from Group
operations and independent growers) and volumes available for
retail.
Market risks of pricing and exchange rates mainly impact on
orchard operations (the amount the Group is paid for growing
crops) with a lesser impact on retail revenues which the Group
mainly collects as a commission on sales. Market risks do not
directly impact on post harvest operations, as charges are normally
set prior to harvest and deducted before sales revenues are paid to
supplying growers.
The Group operates in four regions spread over two countries;
New Zealand's Northland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty, and
in Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce lines are
kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears and avocados, with small
production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail activities
are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce),
Australia and Asia. The Group's geographical, product and market
spread limits the impact on Group operations from an adverse
event occurring in a specific region, produce or market. To further
mitigate risks, the Board uses the following strategies.
Production risks - climatic events, disease and pests
The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production
risks. This includes orchard management practices to optimise
production from Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure
post harvest and retail services are suitably resourced to manage
each season's crop volumes.
In New Zealand, the major climatic risks are hail, frost and storm
damage.
• hail - main risk to kiwifruit - hail events are typically highly
localised, and the Group has access to industry hail insurance,
plus top-up payments from a Seeka Growers hail insurance
programme.
• frost - main risk to kiwifruit - frost events are typically regional,
and the Group advocates best-practice crop protection,
including active frost management on kiwifruit orchards
operated by the Group and other growers supplying the
Group's post harvest operations.

• drought - to secure adequate irrigation, the Group has
purchased extensive, long-term water shares from a reliable
irrigation programme.
• hail - events are typically localised, and the Group currently
has hail cloth protecting one orchard with the extension of
cover to more orchards being evaluated.
• fire - risk of serious grass wild-fire rises during periods of
extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority responsible
for risk assessment and management of fire events. The Group
takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk including
removing excess vegetation from Group properties.
All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest
incursions. To minimise the risk of crop loss the Group monitors
its orchards and undertakes recognised spray programmes to
protect crops to the fullest extent possible. The kiwifruit vine
disease Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is widespread
throughout New Zealand, and is being actively managed. To date
Psa has not been detected in Australia.
Market returns
New Zealand kiwifruit
The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit
harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing
activities are undertaken by Zespri Group Limited under statutory
regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the level of
Zespri's market returns which impact on the Group's orchard
profitability. The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling
techniques to analyse current and projected orchard income. This
information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease
terms.
New Zealand avocados and kiwiberries
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocados and
kiwiberries with half of the kiwiberry sales and all of the avocado
sales managed by the Group's retail operations. The Group
forecasts seasonal supply, monitors market conditions, develops a
sales programme around the needs of key retailers and controls
product quality and supply to optimise market access and returns.
This information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard
lease terms.
The Group has no material direct currency risk from export sales
as it does not own the products but acts as the growers’ agent. The
Group may hedge up to the total cash flows from each operation
using actual sales made and estimated total product volumes to be
exported.
Imported tropical produce
The Group has no material direct market, price and currency risk
from imported products (banana, pineapple and papaya) as the
supply agreement enables the Group to amend its purchase price
according to trading conditions.
Australian produce

• storm damage - risk to all crops - storm events are typically
regional, and the Group advocates best-practice crop
protection, including shelter belts on all orchards operated
by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's post
harvest operations.

The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all
Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian
operations. As the largest single grower and supplier of Australian
kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong
relationships with key retailers. The Group forecasts seasonal
supply, monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme
around the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and
supply to optimise market access and returns.

In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As
the owner and operator of all orchards supplying its Australian
operations, the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total
production base. The orchards are located on three sites in the
Mundoona region.

Seeka Australia is the Group’s single major international
operation, exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign
exchange risk includes future commercial transactions, assets,
liabilities and net investments. Currency exposure from net assets is
managed through borrowings in Australian dollars.

47

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Accounting policies
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Operating leases include short term orchard leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the
lessor) are charged to the Statement of Financial Performance on a straight line basis over the period of the lease, except for short term
orchard leases where lease costs are recognised at the same time as other crop related income and expenses.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
customers, including outstanding receivables, derivative financial
instruments and committed transactions.

For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their
subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require
any collateral or security to support financial instruments due to the
quality of the financial institutions.

The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if
counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The
Group's maximum exposure are:

For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals
predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post
harvest services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is
therefore not considered significant.

• the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial
assets as stated in the consolidated statement of financial
position, and
• the amount of contingent liabilities, if any, in relation to the
financial guarantees provided by the Group.

Other than concentration of credit risk on liquid funds deposited
with one bank with a high credit rating, the Group does not
have any other significant concentration of credit risk as trade
receivables are spread over approximately 200 customers.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in
meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.

When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are
invested in interest bearing current accounts.

The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows,
liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants,
to ensure that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate
committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet
its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow
forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.

At balance date, the Group had $115.6m (2014 - $46m) of
available credit of which $54.2m (2014 - $20.2m) was drawn. All
credit lines are currently provided by one finance provider.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital
structure to support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.

The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or
selling assets.

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants
imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and
earnings times interest cover. At no stage during the year did the
Group breach any of its lending covenants. Refer to note 17.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk
through incidental investments classified on the statement of
financial position either as available-for-sale or at fair value
through profit or loss. The majority of these investments are in
industry-related entities, only some of which are publicly traded.

The decision to change the fair value of an investment is recorded
through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial
performance whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance
was available. When no such reserve existed, any related loss
is processed directly in the statement of financial performance,
otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk

A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other
variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit
and equity reserves.

The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short
and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions.
The Board continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest
rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are
designated as effective hedging instruments and hedge accounting
is applied.
The following table details interest rate and price sensitivity of the
Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their impact on the
statement of financial performance or equity. Cash and advance
balances do not attract interest and are not subject to pricing risk,
and have therefore been excluded from this analysis.

The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic
benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management
procedures are deemed necessary.

Note 30. Determination of fair values
Fair value of financial assets
The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
The different levels are defined as:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability , either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would
use when determining an appropriate price.

Accounting policies
Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be
estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes. Fair value measurements are categorised into a threelevel hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation
techniques used.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets
(such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and available-forsale securities) is based on quoted market prices at balance date
(level 1 inputs). The quoted market price used for financial assets
held by the Group is the current bid price; the appropriate quoted
market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in
an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined using valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group
uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based
on market conditions existing at each balance date. Quoted

market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used
for long-term debt instruments held. Other techniques, such as
estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value
for the remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest
rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated
future cash flows.
Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade
receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair
values due to their short term nature. The fair value of financial
assets and liabilities with unobservable (level 3 inputs) reflect the
assumptions that market participants would use when determining
an appropriate price, additional disclosure is provided for the
inputs and assumptions used in such cases.
Land and buildings and interest in leased land
Fair value is determined on a rolling 3-year cycle by an
independent valuer using three different approaches as described
in note 9.

Interest rate swap contracts - cash flow hedge		

Group bank loans currently carry an average variable interest rate of 5.4% (Dec 2014 - 5.4%), with the Group using interest rate swaps to
protect the term portion of the loans. Swaps cover 93% (Dec 2014 - 93%) of the term liabilities at balance date and are classified as held
for trading or as cash flow hedges.

Accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments and hedging

Cash flow hedge

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date. The resulting
gain or loss is recognised as a financing cost in profit or loss
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as
a hedge instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition
in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current based on the
effective date.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the
hedge relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold,
terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing
in equity at that time remains in other comprehensive income
and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised in the statement of financial performance. When a
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative
gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is
immediately transferred to the statement of financial performance
within other gains / (losses).

Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents
the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy
for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group
documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a
hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in
cash flows of the hedged item.

52

Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate
valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an
active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market
practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments,
assumptions are based on quoted market rates and reliance
placed on quotes provided by Westpac.

Accounting policies
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories:
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and
receivables and available for sale financial assets. Classification
depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
The Group determines the classification of its investments at initial
recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance
date.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised
when the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments
are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for
all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or
loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss
are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are
expensed in the statement of financial performance. Financial
assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows
from the investments have expired or have been transferred and
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership. Available for sale financial assets and financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair
value.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub categories: financial assets held for
trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss
on initial recognition. A financial asset is classified in this category
if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or
if so designated by the Group. Derivatives are also categorised as
held for trading.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services
directly to a debtor with no intention of selling the receivable.
Loans and receivables are included in receivables in the statement
of financial position.
Available for sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally
marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either
designated in this category or not classified in any of the other
category. They are included in non-current assets unless the
Group intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of
balance date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date
or the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell
the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus

54

transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value
through profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognised when
the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value
through profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are carried
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Realised
and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
category are included in the statement of financial performance in
the period in which they arise. Unrealised gains and losses arising
from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified
as available for sale are recognised in other comprehensive
income in the available for sale investments revaluation reserve.
However, if the loss is deemed to represent objective evidence
of an impairment, any additional loss over and above previous
gains recognised in reserves will be recognised in the statement of
financial performance. When securities classified as available for
sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included
in the statement of financial performance as gains and losses from
investment securities.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid
prices. If the market for a financial asset or unlisted security is
not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques. These include reference to the fair values of recent
arm’s length transactions, involving the same instruments or other
instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow
analysis, and option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer’s
specific circumstances.
Impairment of financial assets
At balance date the Group assesses whether there is objective
evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available
for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of
a security below its cost is considered in determining whether
the security is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available
for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss is measured as
the difference between the acquisition cost and the current
fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset
previously recognised in profit and loss, is removed from equity
and recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Impairment losses on equity instruments recognised in the
statement of financial performance are not reversed through other
comprehensive income.

Note 33. Application of new and revised New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing
standards that are now in effect

Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing
standards that are not yet effective

The following new standard and amendments are mandatory for
the first time in the current year and adopted by the Group.

The Group has not early applied the following new and revised
standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued
but are not yet effective:

NZ IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’ (effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 July 2014). The amendment clarifies
the definition of a 'vesting condition' and separately defines
'performance condition' and 'service condition'.
NZ IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ (effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 July 2014). The amendment clarifies that
an obligation to pay contingent consideration which meets the
definition of a 'financial instrument' is classified as a financial
liability or as equity, on the basis of the definitions in IAS 32.
NZ IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ (effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 July 2014). The standard is amended to
require disclosure of the judgements made by management in
aggregating operating segments. The standard is further amended
to require a reconciliation of segment assets to the entity's assets
when segment assets are reported.
NZ IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ & NZ IAS 38 'Intangible
assets' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July
2014). Both standards are amended to clarify how the gross
carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation are treated
where an entity uses the revaluation model.
NZ IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures' (effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014). The standard is
amended to include, as a related party, an entity that provides key
management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the
parent of the reporting entity ('the management entity).
NZ IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interest in other entities' (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). The
standard applies to entities who have an interest in subsidiaries,
joint arrangements, or associates. It establishes disclosure
objectives and specifies minimum disclosure that an entity must
provide to meet those objectives.
NZ IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements' (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). These
amendments remove the accounting and disclosure requirements
for consolidated financial statements as a result of the issue of
NZ IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and NZ IFRS 12
Disclosure of interests in other entities.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing
standards that have been early adopted
NZ IAS 41 (Amendment) 'Agriculture'. (effective for annual periods
beginning or after 1 January 2016). Early adoption is allowed.
Biological assets except for bearer plants are accounted for
under IAS 41 while bearer plants are accounted for under IAS 16
'Property, Plant and Equipment'. The amendments also clarify that
produce growing on bearer plants is to be accounted for under IAS
41. This amendment has been adopted early by the Group and
applied retrospectively from 1 January 2013.

NZ IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' (effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2016). The amendment requires
an investor to apply the principles of business combination
accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that
constitutes a business in NZ IFRS 3. Existing interests in the joint
operation are not remeasured on acquisition of an additional
interest, provided joint control is maintained.
NZ IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017). NZ IFRS 15
addresses recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.
It replaces the current revenue recognition guidance in NZ IAS 18
Revenue and NZ IAS 11 Construction contracts and is applicable
to all entities with revenue. It sets out a 5 step model for revenue
recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The Group has yet to assess NZ IFRS 15's full impact. The
Group will apply this standard from 1 January 2017.
NZ IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018). NZ IFRS 9 is to replace
IAS 39 and will simplify the mixed measurement model as well
as establish three primary measurement categories for financial
assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value
through profit and loss. Basis of classification depends on the
entity's business model and contractual cash flow characteristics of
the asset. IAS 39 guidance on impairment and hedge accounting
will continue to apply.
NZ IFRS 16 'Leases' (effective for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2019). NZ IFRS 16 replaces the current guidance
in NZ IAS 17. Under NZ IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease
if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Under
NZ IAS 17, a lessee was required to make a distinction between
a finance lease (on balance sheet) and an operating lease (off
balance sheet). NZ IFRS 16 now requires a lessee to recognise
a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a ‘right-ofuse asset’ for virtually all lease contracts. Included is an optional
exemption for certain short-term leases and leases of low-value
assets; however, this exemption can only be applied by lessees.
For lessors, the accounting for leases under NZ IFRS 16 is almost
the same as NZ IAS 17. However, because the guidance on the
definition of a lease has been updated (as well as the guidance on
the combination and separation of contracts), lessors will also be
affected by the new standard.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted but only
in conjunction with NZ IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with
Customers.
The Group intends to adopt NZ IFRS 16 on its effective date and
has yet to assess its full impact.

Auditors’ Report

Independent Auditors’ Report

to the shareholders of Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the financial statements of Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited (“the Company”)
on pages 14 to 55, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015, the
statement of financial performance, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes
in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial
statements that include significant accounting policies and other explanatory information for the
Group. The Group comprises the Company and the entities it controlled at 31 December 2015 or from
time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of
these financial statements in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal controls
as the Directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). These
standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider the internal controls relevant
to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
We are independent of the Group. Our firm provides tax related and other assurance services for the
Group. The provision of these other services has not impaired our independence.

56

Seeka ANNUAL REPORT 2015

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements on pages 14 to 55 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and its financial performance and cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.
Restriction on Use of our Report
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body, in accordance with the
Companies Act 1993. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state those matters which
we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have
formed.

SUMMARY OF WAIVERS GRANTED BY NZX
On 1 September 2014, NZX granted Seeka a waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 7.11.1 in relation to its grower incentive
scheme in respect of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 kiwifruit supply seasons.
Listing Rule 7.11.1 requires an issuer to issue shares within 5 business days after the latest date on which applications for those shares
close. Under Seeka’s grower incentive scheme, a grower is required to return an entitlement and acceptance form prior to 31 March
in the relevant supply season in order to participate in the scheme. However, a participating grower would not be issued shares under
the scheme until 7 September of the relevant supply season and any future supply season(s), which is later than the 5 business day
period required by Listing Rule 7.11.1.
Accordingly, NZX has granted Seeka a waiver from the requirements of Listing Rule 7.11.1 for the purposes of its grower incentive
scheme. A condition of the waiver is that Seeka must issue shares within 5 business days of 31 August in each of the relevant supply
seasons.
