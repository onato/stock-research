ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Seeka is pleased to provide you with our annual report covering our performance, strategic progress and audited financial results
for the year ended 31 December 2019. The company has made excellent progress on its strategic growth pathway, including
consolidating business units and reducing debt through orchard sales, while continuing to deliver excellent results to our grower
clients.
The Group's financial performance was impacted by early 2019’s long dry summer which lowered Hayward kiwifruit yields
in both Australia and New Zealand. Hayward volumes were well down on forecast and prior year yields, and negatively
impacted our financial results. Offsetting this, Seeka expanded our core business with the purchase of Aongatete, delivered
cost efficiencies, made good gains on the sale of Northland orchard assets, and delivered significant improvements in our retail
services business. Operationally, the performance and returns to supplying growers were excellent.
Seeka continues to realise orchard assets held for sale to reduce debt. In some cases, the orchard sales are still awaiting
subdivision or boundary adjustments, and once completed both the sale and gain will be recorded in 2020.
Year end total net bank debt of $116.8m compares to $79.1m at year end 2018, and $148.1m at 30 June 2019. The successful
sale of orchard assets currently being marketed will further reduce net bank debt by at least $27.1m, with $10.1m of properties
conditionally sold at year end which were settled in February 2020.
Seeka continued to invest in core infrastructure with the build of onshore New Zealand post harvest capacity. The Oakside
$21.4m pack house and cool store project was completed in 2019 (the cool store build finished after the kiwifruit harvest) and a
modern pack house and cool store complex is under construction in Kerikeri, with phase two underway. The company expects
lower post harvest capital expenditure through 2020 and 2021.
The Group is focused on consolidating operations following the acquisition of the Northland and Aongatete assets, including
selling orchard assets to repay debt while securing supply to our core kiwifruit business. We are also investigating the sell down
and lease back of the Group’s Australian kiwifruit orchards which would release funds for debt reduction and potential expansion,
as we continue to look for investment opportunities by acquisition to deliver continuing accretive growth and shareholder value.
Seeka has fully adopted NZ IFRS 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16 - the new NZ accounting standard for leasing arrangements), and these
2019 financial results and 2018 comparatives are consistent with the new standard. The transition to NZ IFRS 16 negatively
impacts Seeka's financial results as the accounting for lease interest costs and depreciation are higher than the lease payment
at the beginning of the lease period. Further the full gain on orchard sales is no longer recognised in the statement of financial
performance when the property is leased back to Seeka.

Dividend announcement
A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend comprises a normal dividend of $0.08 per share
(following Board policy on a pre NZ IFRS 16 basis) and a special dividend of $0.04 cents per share following the completion of
property sales negotiated in 2019 and completed in 2020.
The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 17 April 2020 to those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 20 March 2020.
The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price. This dividend will bring the total dividends
distributed in the last 12 months to $0.24 (prior twelve months $0.24).

Outlook
Seeka is anticipating improved earnings in 2020 conditional on New Zealand and Australian crop volumes. The company has
an increasing volume of Zespri SunGold with both new growers and new developments, along with a significantly improved
SeekaFresh business and increasing avocado volumes. The company continues to consolidate the acquired businesses and
complete Northland orchard sales, and is investigating the potential sale and lease back of the Group’s Australian kiwifruit
orchards. Seeka is anticipating earnings growth, noting market uncertainty from the current coronavirus outbreak.
The company will provide current year earnings guidance at half year (once harvest is completed) and will update shareholders
on key events as and when they occur.

Operating asset growth through investments and acquisitions
Our core kiwifruit industry is going through a rapid growth phase, driven by the global demand for SunGold kiwifruit. Seeka's
strategic growth plan includes investing in orcharding services so landowners can produce high-value crops, and post harvest
capacity to manage ongoing volume growth. We have also extended our geographical reach with the 2018 Northland acquisition
and subsequent site build, and the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete in our kiwifruit heartland. These investments have secured new
capacity and are delivering a world-class service to our new client growers. Our investments in post harvest capacity are forecast
to handle the growth in crop volumes through to 2021.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Review of operations
Financial performance
Revenue for the twelve months ended 31 December increased 16% to $236.9m (2018: $203.7m). Consolidated earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $34.5m (2018: $33.3m); up 4%. This includes an $0.63m EBITDA loss
from Seeka Australia (2018: $0.06m loss), as a very dry summer lowered Hayward kiwifruit volumes, plus an underperforming
nashi programme.
Consolidated profit after tax totalled to $6.88m (2018: $6.65m), with cash flow from operations up 14% to $18.59m (2018:
$16.35m).
In 2019 Seeka invested $34.67m in property plant and equipment, primarily building the Kerikeri pack house and commissioning
a new packing machine and upgrading Oakside packing machine 2, pre-coolers and cool stores. Once additional pre-cooler and
cool store builds at Kerikeri are completed, Seeka’s post harvest capacity is forecast to be able to handle fruit supply for the next
two seasons. Our focus is on improving supply chain efficiency and seeking innovative solutions to curtail further investments.
During the year, Seeka realised $44.53m in assets held for sale of which $34.55m related to its Northland orchards. These
Northland sales delivered $3.19m in gains along with a secure supply commitment. In addition, at year end Seeka had
conditionally sold a further $10.1m in Northland properties; these sales settled on 24 February 2020.
At balance date, Seeka held $27.08m of assets for sale, including its Australian kiwifruit orchards which are currently being
considered for sale and lease back.
The combination of conditional sales, assets held for sale, or sold assets awaiting settlement totals $42.6m.
Net debt at 31 December (bank loans less bank deposits) was $116.79m compared to $79.01m at year end 2018 and $148.08m
at 30 June 2019.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

New Zealand orchard operations
Seeka’s New Zealand orchard operations span from Northland through to the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast, providing a
comprehenseive service to owners of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry orchards, including managing their orchards, vine management,
orchard leasing and long-term land leases where Seeka develops and operates the orchards.
Orcharding kiwifruit volumes increased from new production associated with the Northland and Aongatete acquisitions, with
the company growing 41.11m kilograms of kiwifruit (11.42m trays) compared to the prior year’s 37.44m kilograms (10.68m trays).
The acquired orchards helped offset the drop in Hayward yields (9,800 trays per hectare compared to 11,800 trays per hectare in
2018), caused by the hot summer which restricted fruit size and increased reject rates. Hayward yields have now fluctuated over
the last three seasons.
Seeka also grew 732,000 kilograms of avocados (2018: 200,000 kgs) and 64,400 kilograms of kiwiberry (2018: 15,000 kgs).
In 2019 Seeka purchased Aongatete Coolstores Limited and has now fully integrated the orchard division.
Orchard operations revenue of $72.42m is up 37% on 2018's $52.83m, while EBITDA of $4.99m compares to $4.21m in 2018.
The moderate increase in EBITDA reflects the profit share mechanisms in favour of the orchard owners, alongside the primary
risk.
At year end orchard operations had $54.18m of assets and $34.78m of liabilities resulting in $19.39m in net assets (2018:
$25.82m).
Seeka continues to invest in long term lease arrangements with $2.33m invested in 2019, on top of $2.94m invested in 2018.
Income from these investments will flow from 2020 as the orchards enter production.

New Zealand post harvest operations
Post harvest operates eight major facilities spread throughout the major growing regions in the North Island handling all produce from our
orcharding operations and from our independent growers, and packing other fruits including citrus on contract for third parties.
In the period, 33.46m trays of kiwifruit were packed (2018: 31.41m), with 3.9m trays supplied by growers associated with our new
Aongatete acquisition completed 18 March.
Total post harvest volumes were impacted by the dry summer, with Hayward yields from Seeka’s traditional supplying growers
down 17% on the prior period. Felt across the industry, this significant drop in Hayward production reduced product flow to
Seeka’s post harvest operations, and tempered the positive impact Aongatete delivered to our core post harvest business.
The company had the capacity, systems and personnel to deliver a timely harvest to our grower clients. Coolstore fruit loss, a key
measure of performance for our growers, was extremely low across all varieties.
Purchased immediately prior to harvest, Aongatete was integrated into the Seeka business and scale-related synergies will be
delivered in 2020.
Post harvest revenue of $140.11m compared to $123.81m in 2018. Driven by higher wages, inflation and the ongoing focus on
health and safety, post harvest costs are up across our industry. EBITDA of $40.98m compares with $37.16m in 2018.

New Zealand retail services operations
Includes the supply and sale of avocados and class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, sale of New Zealand kiwifruit through collaborative
programmes, handling of imported tropical fruits, and the production, marketing and distribution of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.
EBITDA of $1.67m is down from 2018's $2.34m due to a reduced kiwiberry harvest (in line with lower Hayward yields), lower
avocado volumes from biennial bearing, and higher supply chain costs. The retail services business has undergone a revitalisation
with significant improvement in financial performance from late 2019. The growth in retail services is set to continue in 2020.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Australia operations
Seeka Australia PTY Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned entity, owns and operates kiwifruit, nashi and pear orchards along with associated
post harvest facilities in Victoria, and directly markets Seeka produce to retailers.
Kiwifruit yields were again down following a very hot and dry summer which impacted fruit size; kiwifruit remain profitable, albeit
at lower levels. The green nashi sales programme delivered a loss. Volumes and planted areas have been reset to match the crop
to profitable market opportunities.
Seeka is positive about its Australian investment and its Australian orchard portfolio, and is confident that its proposed strategy
to sell and leaseback its kiwifruit orchards will realise a gain that will be used to repay debt. This process is continuing.
Seeka continues to test the production and marketing of new kiwifruit and licenced pear varieties on its Australian orchards, with
70 hectares of kiwifruit and 26 hectares of pears in development which will add to production from 2020 onwards.
The detection of Psa in Australia did not impact our mature Hayward kiwifruit orchards and the company continues to monitor
its development orchards. Seeka has licensed a Chinese Gold variety to grow on its new Australian kiwifruit development
orchards.
Across all varieties Seeka is concentrating on quality and increasing financial returns.
EBITDA loss of $0.63m (2018 : $0.06m loss) was due to lower yields and an under-performing green nashi programme.
Seeka’s Australian operations are an important investment in extending our geographical reach and product range and we will
continue to further develop the business, including upgrading existing and developing new orchards, and investing in water
to grow production. Yields per hectare and total volumes are expected to improve over the next three years as new plantings
mature.

Agile - preparing for challenges and seizing opportunities
Seeka has launched a series of project teams which have adopted the Agile approach. Drawing from expertise held across
our business, Seeka’s Agile teams are focusing on important issues to Seeka and its stakeholders. This includes Seeka's Agile
Sustainability team which is helping reshape our business to the structural challenges of climate change. We are on a journey
of innovation as we determine how to best deliver sustainable business practices within a fast-changing world, measure our
achievements, and hold ourselves accountable for our performance to all stakeholders. Seeka's first sustainability reporting is
included in this document.
The other areas of focus for Seeka's Agile teams include Safety, Innovation, Marketing, SeekaApp and Information Systems. This
is a trial process with teams working to identify their goals, achievable actions and reporting mechanisms. Seeka is finding its way
with Agile, and possibly not all projects will succeed, however excellent early progress is being made.

Strategic highlights
Seeka continues to enact our strategy. Kiwifruit is our core product, with the company diversifying geographically and targeting
complementary produce categories. The focus is on growth that delivers accretive value to our stakeholders; our shareholders,
growers, employees, contractors and community. Our focus is on delivering our marketers, principally Zespri, the highest-quality
fruit and delivering our growers great returns through our supply chain.
Seeka has excelled where it operates the entire value chain from the orchard to the customer and delivered incremental returns
to growers, as demonstrated with avocado and kiwiberry. Seeka delivers orchard-to-market excellence in New Zealand kiwifruit,
avocados, class 2 kiwifruit, and kiwiberry, along with Australian kiwifruit, nashi and European pears.
Seeka continues to consolidate its position, setting its management structures and selling orchards with secure supply contracts
to reset debt while pursuing operational excellence.
We have expanded our core business through the Aongatete acquisition, and secured Northland post harvest volumes while
negotiating $34.55m of orchard sales, with a further $10.10m settled in February 2020. Seeka has also invested in long-term
orchard relationships. Seeka continues to market its remaining Northland orchards.

Securing supply to New Zealand post harvest
87% of the kiwifruit crop packed from harvest
2019 was secured through grower commitments.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Seeka is working through the process of potentially selling and leasing back 105 hectares of Australian kiwifruit orchards (on 199
hectares of land) to test if the same outcomes can be obtained in Australia. The planned sale and leaseback will help accelerate
growth in this key market while repaying Seeka debt.
Market conditions for Australian-grown produce are good and the fruit is of excellent quality, noting it is a completely different
growing environment. Kiwifruit production in Australia is set to double in the next five years.
The company has focused on asset utilisation and capacity planning and has substantially built the infrastructure to handle
volume growth over the next two seasons. It has deliberately positioned itself in Northland to provide excellent service to the
region’s growth in avocados and kiwifruit, and has actively increased its avocado market share, including directly purchasing and
syndicating Far North orchards. This has delivered a benefit to investors and new volumes and market share to Seeka.

Safety
Seeka’s focus is on continuous improvement to ensure the health and safety of all personnel at all locations. All reported
incidents and near misses are followed up within the company. There were three serious harm incidents in 2019, two hand
injuries (packing machine drop and Bunbartha pollen mill), and a very serious incident at Oakside when a forklift driver was
injured by the counterweights between two forklifts. The worker in this incident suffered significant injuries and while expected
to make a full recovery, has had an extended period off work. Full traffic management reviews have taken place with corrective
actions and extra barriers erected. Significant money has been invested in machine guarding, traffic barriers and traffic planning
to further ensure the safety of our people, particularly near fixed plant with moving components, and from moving plant and
vehicles.
At 5.0 the total recordable injury frequency rate is above the annual 4.5 threshold and ahead of the 2018 rate of 4.5. The
company continues to monitor, manage and take all reasonable steps to prevent workplace injuries.

The total recordable injury frequent rate (TRIFR) measures the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked. In total Seeka worked a total of 2.70m hours in 2019, with
the number of operating hours varying with the total volumes Seeka packs and handles across all varieties and sites. Seasonal pressures can be challenging along with
harvest deadlines. Seeka TRIFR was 5.0 for 2019.
Severity rate measures the average number of days that an injured person is away from work. Seeka had 3 notifiable injuries including incidents in 2019.

The Seeka team
Seeka’s people have excelled during the year. The company has purchased and integrated Aongatete. It has fully transitioned
to NZ IFRS 16 Leases which given the number and extent of Seeka’s leasing interests, is a significant feat. Operational staff have
delivered excellence in harvest and fruit handling for our grower clients, helping them achieve excellent returns along with the
delivery of outstanding fruit quality to the principal marketer Zespri. The SeekaFresh business has turned its financial performance
around, albeit late in the year. And the Australian business has worked hard in trying conditions supported by Seeka’s commercial
team. Both avocado and kiwiberry growers have benefited from dedicated and focused efforts of the Seeka team.
Seeka continues to invest in its people to become the employer of choice in a tight labour market. The company has reset
minimum wages to new thresholds, and comprehensively reviewed all remuneration levels to ensure Seeka people are well
remunerated. Seeka continues to promote diversity across our organisation, and respect the rights of all employees and
stakeholders. Our remuneration policy promotes pay equity based on performance, and we offer a range of employee-focused
benefits, including health insurance, a wellness programme that supports healthy choices, and a biennial share scheme that
rewards loyalty. We continue to focus on talent development including 12 cadets, with some now emerging as qualified orchard
managers.
Seeka continues to actively source New Zealand workers to fulfil peak seasonal labour demand and operates a parallel
recognised seasonal employer programme (RSE) that delivers focused pastoral care to our overseas workers. Of our 3,000
strong seasonal workforce, Seeka recruited 970 overseas workers through the RSE scheme.
Seasonal labour continues to be a challenge, with the industry increasingly relying on overseas labour to complement the
available local workforce. Backpacker labour was in short supply, adding to employment pressure. This employment environment
pushed the industry to the limit. These circumstances increase the risk profile. Seeka continues to work on initiatives to attract
skilled people and keep them safe.
The company has gone to significant lengths to ensure contractors and subcontractors comply with labour, health and safety
legislation, and strive to achieve best practice. Seeka has a dedicated team that coaches, audits and undertakes gap analysis with
our contractor and subcontractor community to ensure we achieve better than just compliant.

Summary
Seeka continues to consolidate its operations while focusing on delivering performance to our growers. The company has
made excellent progress selling the Northland orchards, reducing debt and securing supply from this region, while developing a
world-class post harvest facility in Kerikeri. Seeka is now pursuing a similar sale and potential leaseback strategy for orchards in
Australia.
Hayward kiwifruit yields were down on last season, and this impacted our profit in 2019. Despite a number of challenges, the
company is benefiting from substantial cash gains realised by the ongoing sales of our Northland orchard portfolio, which along
with the acquisition of Aongatete to our core business has resulted in a pleasing result for the financial year
Seeka expects increased earnings in 2020 following this year of consolidation.
We thank all growers, shareholders and stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willingly give to Seeka.

Basis of preparation
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements. Accounting policies which are
limited to a specific note are described in that note.

Reporting entity and statutory base

Basis of consolidation

The financial statements presented are those of the consolidated
Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as Seeka Limited or the
Company. The group is referred to as the Group, Seeka, or Seeka
Group.

Subsidiaries

Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New
Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets
Conduct (FMC) Reporting Entity for the purposes of the FMC Act
2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the
NZX main board equity security market (NZX Main Board).

Nature of operations
Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
In New Zealand the Group provides orchard management, post
harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit, avocado, citrus,
berry and kiwiberry industries. Seeka manufactures and sells the Kiwi
Crush and Kiwi Crushies product range along with avocado oil. The
Group also provides retail and ripening services for imported tropical
produce, and operates a wholesale market.
In Australia, Seeka owns and operates orchards and associated post
harvest assets, making the Group the largest producer and supplier
of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of European
pears, plus lesser production of other temperate-climate fruits,
including plums and apricots.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the FMC
Act 2013. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),
incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other applicable financial
reporting standards as appropriate for profit-oriented entities. The
Group financial statements also comply with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with
the exception of:
– assets held for sale at fair value (note 9)
– land and buildings at fair value (note 10)
– water shares at fair value (note 11)
– biological assets - crop at fair value (note 12)
– right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities at present value of
expected cash payments (note 13)
– financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at
fair value through comprehensive income (note 30 and note 31)
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
financial statements are set out below.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intragroup balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting
from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets exchanged, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date the acquisition is
settled. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on
transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency (NZD) using the exchange rates prevailing during the month
of that transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income
statement. The presentational currency is the New Zealand dollar
(NZD).
Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of
which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
– Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the
Group are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance
sheet;
– Income and expenses for each entity's income statement and
statement of other comprehensive income, are translated at
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
– All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other
comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the
Board) on 26 February 2020.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Summary of significant changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout
the periods presented in the financial statements. A number of new
and amended standards became applicable for the current reporting
period and the Group changed its accounting policies to comply with
the following standard:
– From 1 January 2019 the Group has retrospectively adopted NZ
IFRS 16 Leases. All leases have been retrospectively applied from
their original start date as if the standard had always applied. The
comparative information for these leases has been restated and
is reflected in the opening balance sheet, see note 13 for more
information.
Where a change in the presentational format of the financial
statements has been made during the period, comparative figures
have been restated accordingly.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future
operational and financial performance. By definition, these
assumptions may not always equal actual results. The estimates
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are
identified in the notes below. Estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as
adjusted for current market conditions and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Assumptions underlying management’s estimates
can be found in the following notes to the financial statements.

Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the
entity
The following amendments apply from 1 January 2020 and may lead
to adjustments in Seeka's accounting policies in the future.
Amendments to NZ IAS 1 and NZ IAS 8 - Definition of material
The IASB has made amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial
Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors which use a consistent definition of materiality
throughout International Financial Reporting Standards and the
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, clarifying when
information is material and incorporating some of the guidance in IAS
1 about immaterial information.
Amendments to NZ IFRS 3 - Definition of a business
The amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to
include an input and a substantive process that together significantly
contribute to the ability to create outputs. The definition of the term
'outputs' is amended to focus on goods and services provided to
customers, generating investment income and other income, and
it excludes returns in the form of lower costs and other economic
benefits.
Revised conceptual framework for financial reporting
The IASB has issued a revised conceptual framework which will be
used in standard-setting decisions with immediate effect. Key changes
include:
– increasing the prominence of stewardship in the objective of
financial reporting
– reinstating prudence as a component of neutrality

are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables,
which include GST invoiced.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

– removing the probability threshold for recognition and adding
guidance on derecognition
– adding guidance on different measurement basis, and
– stating that profit or loss is the primary performance indicator and
that, in principle, income and expenses in other comprehensive
income should be recycled where this enhances the relevance or
faithful representation of the financial statements.
No changes will be made to any of the current accounting standards.
However, entities that rely on the framework in determining their
accounting policies for transactions, events or conditions that are not
otherwise dealt with under the accounting standards will need to apply
the revised framework from 1 January 2020. These entities will need to
consider whether their accounting policies are still appropriate under
the revised framework.
There are no other new standards, amendments or interpretations
that have been issued and are effective that are expected to have a
significant impact on the Group.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in business
activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a
manner consistent with the internal reports provided to the chief
decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the
allocation of resources alongside operational outcomes, such as
EBITDA and EBIT, and are responsible for setting strategic direction.
The Group has five operating segments:
– Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary
services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the
retail sector.
– A single Australian segment encompasses the integrated business
associated with the Group’s Australian-grown produce.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each
segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs and
insurance proceeds recorded in the statement of financial performance
are allocated to all other segments. Transactions between segments
are conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated on consolidation.

New Zealand segments

Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and
internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This
includes fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post
harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and
ripening services for imported fruit, and operates a wholesale market.
Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi
Crush, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and hospitals,
along with post harvest services for kiwiberry.
All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower
services and overhead sections recorded in the statement of financial
performance and impairment and revaluations of other assets not
attributed directly to any other segment. It also includes the gain on
sale from assets classified as held for sale.

Australian operations
The Group owns and operates Australian orchards, provides post
harvest operations and markets the fruit produced from those
orchards, primarily in Australia. The main products are kiwifruit, nashi
pears and European pears.

Orchard operations
The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
orchard owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
citrus, berry, and kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the
Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from
independent orchard owners.

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

Accounting policies
The Group’s major revenue streams are post harvest operations,
orchard management, retail services and Australian operations in
accordance with NZ IFRS 15 adopted in January 2018.
Post harvest
The Group enters into two standardised post harvest contracts:
– The first has two performance obligations; one to collect the supply
of fruit via picking and transportation, the other being maturity
testing, which is provided as needed. The charges are separated in the
contract. All revenue is recognised when the service is performed.
– The second has three performance obligations; to pack fruit,
to cool and dispatch fruit, and to sell class 2 fruit to authorised
markets. These are stand-alone services provided by Seeka. Each
performance obligation has a separate transaction price detailed in
the contract and the obligations are recognised when services are
performed; packing revenue as fruit is packed, cooling revenue as
fruit is loaded out from cool storage, and class 2 as fruit is sold.
Orchard management
The Group enters into two orchard management contracts that are
largely standardised:
– The first is the management contract which has one performance
obligation; to manage fruit production. Revenue is recognised as the
service is performed and is calculated at cost plus an agreed margin
per the contract. The management fee included in the contract is
recognised evenly over the contract's 12 month period. An incentive
fee is only recognised when agreed orchard gate return (OGR)
targets are achieved and an incentive would be receivable.

24

– The second orchard management contract has one performance
obligation; to collect the supply of fruit. The transaction price is
determined using a forecasted OGR. Revenue is recognised when
crops are picked (in the June half year accounts for kiwifruit).
Retail services
The Group enters into three retail service contracts which are
customised to the service being offered (such as ripening or fruit sales):
– The first has one performance obligation; to sell fruit on the owner’s
behalf. For this contract, Seeka is an agent and only collects a
marketer’s commission which is recognised when the fruit is sold.
– The second comprises storage and ripening revenue. Both contain
one performance obligation; to either store or ripen the fruit.
Revenue is recognised as the fruit is being stored or ripened.
– The third is customised with each supplier. The essence of the
contracts remain the same with one performance obligation; to
provide the product ordered. The transaction price is based on the
agreed price (either in writing or verbally) and recognised when the
fruit is sold.
Australia
Australian contracts are entered into by the Australian business. The
contracts are on a one-to-one basis with the fruit purchaser and are
largely standardised. There is one performance obligation; to provide
the fruit to the customer. The transaction price is based on the agreed
price (either in writing or verbally) and recognised when the fruit is sold.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Principal versus agent relationship

Irrigation water rights

A principal relationship is one where Seeka has the performance
obligation to provide the good or service directly and has control of the
asset or has a right to direct the asset. An agency relationship is one
where the performance obligation is to arrange for the good or service
on behalf of the supplier. The Group currently has agent relationships
for the sale of some fruit and vegetables in the retail services segment.

Water allocation rights are carried at fair value supported by the
value of the traded rights on a recognised exchange or market at
measurement date. Annual water allocation rights are recognised as
a current asset when they are allocated to the Group's permanent
water shares from the first of July each year by the Victorian Water
Register, and are subsequently expensed when the entitlement is
used to irrigate orchards. Any gain on revaluation is recognised in the
statement of financial performance.

Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations,
with post harvest revenues recognised as services are provided and
orcharding revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail
revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New Zealand kiwifruit
are harvested from March to June, avocados from July to February, and
kiwiberry from February to March. In Australia nashi and European
pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit from March to
May. As a result of these harvest timings around 60~70% of orchard
revenues are recognised in the first six months of the financial year.
Due to seasonal fluctuations, the timing of the provision of post
harvest services can vary from year to year, however normally 70~80%
is recognised in the first six months of the financial year, but can be
impacted by seasonal fluctuations.

Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the
effective interest method.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.
Gain on sale of assets held for sale
The gain on sale of assets held for sale is recognised when a sale and
purchase agreement is unconditional and the consideration is paid or
payable at that date.

Accounting policies
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of financial performance as incurred, except where future economic benefits arise and they
are recorded as a prepayment.
Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are
recognised in other payables. The employee liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating
sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is
recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date, and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing
for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable
profit. Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly
controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be
applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

27

7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2018 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.

8. Events occurring after balance date
Since 31 December 2019, 26 hectares of Northland orchards classified as assets held for sale (see note 9), were sold under three contracts for a
combined value of $10.11m.
There are no other material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

The following table details the assets classified as held for sale by asset class.

New Zealand dollars
Asset class

At 31 December 2019, 56 hectares of Northland orchards (Dec 2018 - 140 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. These
properties were purchased as part of the 2018 purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited and business combination detailed in note 19b.
At 31 December 2019, 26 hectares had conditional sale agreements subject to subdivision. These sales went unconditional on 17 February 2020,
see note 8.
The assets are classified as held for sale as their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition was met when the sale became highly probable and the assets were available for immediate sale in their present
condition. The Group is committed to the sale and expects the sale to be completed within one year from the date of classification. These assets
are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell as required by NZ IFRS 5, based on independent valuations of the
properties at year end as detailed in note 10.
Assets related to the sale of three orchards in Australia (Hayward, Austral and Lakes) are also recognised as assets held for sale from 1 September
2019. The sale will be subject to a leaseback arrangement. The Group expects that substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the
assets will transfer to a buyer.
As described in note 11, all of the goodwill from the Australia CGU has been allocated to the disposal group, based on the Group's assessment of
relative fair values of the assets held for sale and Australia assets being retained.
The Group used a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate relative fair values. Key assumptions used include yields per hectare, based on
historic actual yields adjusted for the expected effects of orchard development such as regrafting, and market returns, based on normalised
historic returns which are considered a reasonable best estimate of future returns.
A discount rate of 9% and terminal growth rate of 2% were applied. No reasonably possible adjustments in these assumptions would result in a
materially different allocation of goodwill.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group has used estimates to judgementally allocate goodwill to the Australian assets held for sale, as described above.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and
are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred
to the appropriate asset class. At 31 December 2018 assets under
construction related to the Oakside packhouse and coolstore and
Kerikeri packhouse builds. These have now been completed and have
been transferred to land and buildings. The balance at 31 December
2019 is largely related to the Kerikeri coolstore build.

In Australia valuations are undertaken by Preston Rowe Paterson
Shepparton (previously known as Goulburn Valley Property Services),
independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. All Australian
land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2019.

Land and buildings

1. Direct replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the
replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements based
on the current cost of construction less depreciation based on the
age of the building with an allowance for physical depreciation.
Specific consideration is given to the 'optimised depreciated
replacement cost' methodology.

Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a
three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for
buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung
Valuers, ANZIV, independent registered valuer.

30

The valuers consider four different approaches in concert to arrive at
a fair value;

2. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

3. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the
property with a current market rental being established and
capitalising this at an appropriate rate of return (8.5% – 10.5%)
that would be expected by a prudent investor.
4. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method
whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the
investment method and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year

period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market
rentals and estimated costs incurred to maintain land and buildings
in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are
sold in the terminal year (year 11).
The net book value of land is $23.37m (Dec 2018 - $20.3m) and
buildings is $131.14m (Dec 2018 - $89.8m), see note 29.

The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax of $3.20m (Dec 2018 - $2.09m).

Impairment of bearer plants
For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group replaced some Australian bearer plants as a result of the Psa disease being identified on
new grafts. This resulted in an impairment and the write off of the carrying value of bearer plants of $0.40m (Dec 2018 - $0.30m) which was
recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Accounting policies
Bearer plants
Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear,
avocado and other fruiting vines and trees on Group-owned and leased
land. Bearer plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase or establish the
asset.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at
least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any subsequent
improvements at cost, less depreciation. At each annual balance date,
no less than one third of assets classified as land and buildings are
revalued and those valuations are used to assess the appropriateness
of the carrying values of all land and building assets held by the Group,
which effectively revalues all land and buildings annually. Revaluations
are performed more frequently if changing industry conditions may
cause their carrying value to differ significantly from fair value. Any
accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated
against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is
restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and
buildings are accounted for through comprehensive income and other
reserves, except where an asset's assessed fair value is less than the
original cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of
financial performance.
Property, plant and equipment
All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical
cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to
purchase the asset.

Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All
other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of financial
performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Asset impairments are recognised in the statement of financial
performance.
Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
– Buildings
20 - 50 years
– Machinery
10 - 20 years
– Vehicles
4 - 7 years
– Furniture, fittings and equipment
– Bearer plants:

3 - 10 years
5 - 50 years

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted
if appropriate, at balance date and an asset’s carrying amount is
immediately written down to its recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is included in the
statement of financial performance. When revalued assets are sold, the
amounts included in the revaluation reserve in respect of those assets
is transferred to retained earnings.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Property, plant and equipment uses estimated depreciation rates and independent valuations to set asset values. Judgement is also
exercised in determining whether impairment exists, as described above.

Other intangibles are SunGold kiwifruit licences purchased from Zespri
Limited on 1 May 2018. The licences give Seeka the right to plant the
SunGold kiwifruit variety and were purchased with the intention of
using them on the orchards purchased in Northland that were not yet
settled to Seeka's ownership as at 31 December 2018. The licences
were subsequently reclassified as held for sale with the Northland
orchards in 2019 once Seeka obtained the property titles, see note 9.
The amortisation period of software is four to five years.
The Group's interest in leased land was restated as a right-of-use lease
asset now recognised as a result of the retrospective adoption of NZ
IFRS 16 Leases, see note 13.
Water shares are an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure
required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual crops in Australia
and are carried at fair value based on a valuation at 31 December 2019
prepared by Preston Rowe Paterson Shepparton, independent valuers,
Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. The movement in the fair value is
recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Impairment tests for goodwill
The Board reviews business performance based on operating
segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level.
Goodwill represents the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete Coolstores
32

Limited, the 2018 acquisition of the Northland business, the
previously-acquired Glassfields business (now named SeekaFresh)
and the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the fiveyear after-tax cash flow projection, with a terminal value beyond five
years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using
estimated growth rates and discount rates stated in this note. The
assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast
gross margin for the cash generating unit, is determined based on
past performance and the Board's expectations of future market
development, plus the Group's five year financial plans.
During the year ended 31 December 2019, $7.0m of goodwill was
recognised from the acquisition of Aongatete Coolstores Limited, see
note 19a.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, $1.2m of goodwill was recognised
from the acquisition of the Kerikeri post harvest facility, see note 19b.
Following a major customer moving to their own direct supply of
bananas in 2018, the Board reassessed the useful life remaining on
the intangible asset associated with the contract. The useful life
was reduced from 6 years to 4 years and with no remaining term to
run the supplier contract intangible asset was fully amortised at 31
December 2018. Further, the Board reviewed the latest forecasts and
ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

further impaired the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the
Glassfield's banana business by $0.95m at 31 December 2018. The
remaining goodwill recognised as an intangible asset on the balance
sheet is $0.43m.
All the goodwill relating to the acquisition of Seeka Australia Pty
Limited has been reclassified as an asset held for sale relating to the

Group's strategy to sell the established kiwifruit orchards in Australia,
lease them back and focus on development of kiwifruit and new pear
varieties, see note 9.
All amounts recognised as goodwill at 31 December 2019 were tested for
impairment at balance date and no impairment arose in the current year.

Accounting policies
Intangible assets
Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and
amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite life
are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually
for impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. When assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able to
generate cash flow.
Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Internally developed computer software is capitalised when it enters
the development phase and includes costs incurred to develop and
test the software for use. Intangible assets are amortised over their
estimated useful life (typically three to five years).
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the

fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill on a business acquisition is included
in intangible assets, and on acquisition of an associate is included in
investments in associates. When acquired in business combinations,
the goodwill is annually tested for impairment (or more frequently if
deemed prudent) and carried at cost less accumulated impairment
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the
carrying amount of goodwill relating to that business.
Supplier contracts
When an intangible asset is recognised on a supplier contract it is
amortised over the life of the contract on a straight line basis. The
expense is charged to the statement of financial performance.
Water shares
The Group records permanent water shares at fair value based on an
independent valuation at balance date. The shares are fully tradeable
and have an indefinite life and are not amortised.
Other intangibles
Other intangibles subject to amortisation are amortised over the life
of the asset on a straight line basis. The expense is charged to the
statement of financial performance.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The impairment testing of intangible assets uses estimates of revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates as detailed
above.

12. Biological assets - crop
Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears, other pears, cherry, avocado, apricot, and plum crops growing on leased and
owned orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.
The following table reconciles beginning balances to end balances for biological assets crop measured at fair value defined as level 3 in note 29.

New Zealand dollars

The following table details the classification of biological assets - crop.

Crop where cost is deemed fair value
Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date and as
such cost is deemed fair value, see note 29.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, $0.50m of development costs were expensed due to the effect of Psa on recently grafted crops on
producing orchards in Australia (Dec 2019: Nil). This was reflected in the change in the fair value of the biological asset.

Accounting policies
Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair value depends
on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (provided the costs
are considered recoverable). When costs are not considered recoverable they are expensed in the statement of financial performance.
When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.
The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference to current and expected sales returns when available. When market data
is not available an assessment is made based on historical data.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The valuation of biological assets uses estimates of market returns to determine value.

13. Leases
As a result of the adoption of NZ IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019, the Group is required to report all leases on the balance sheet, with the exception of
low value leases or leases less than 12 months. The Group has elected to adopt the standard fully retrospectively, which means prior year numbers
have been restated as if the standard had always applied. A full reconciliation pre and post NZ IFRS 16 implementation is shown in this note.

Additions
On 30 September 2019, the Group entered into the sale and leaseback transaction for an orchard in Northland previously recognised as an asset
held for sale. As part of the sale the Group signed a 15 year lease for the orchard.

Key terms explained
Right-of-use lease asset
The asset that the Group obtains control of when signing a lease.
Lease liability
The present value of all future known payments on the lease.
Lease depreciation
The right-of-use lease asset value divided by the term of the lease.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Lease interest
The discounted portion of the lease liability (similar to interest on a
table mortgage).
Lease principal
The difference between the cash lease payment and the lease interest.

35

Accounting policies
Under the new lease standard the Group has recognised lease
liabilities which were previously classified as 'operating lease
payments' under the old standard NZ IAS 17 Leases. The lease liability
is measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments,
including any renewal periods that are likely to be exercised,
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate which ranges
between 5% and 10%. The discount rate is based on the Group's
incremental borrowing rate, being the rate the Group would borrow
the funds required to purchase the asset. When determining the
discount rate, Seeka considers that the right-of-use lease asset should
not be greater than the fair value of the underlying asset being leased.
The Group’s right-of-use lease asset is equal to the lease liability on
the day of lease inception, with the exception of sale and leaseback
transactions where the asset is measured as the proportion of the
carrying value of the asset sold of which the benefit is retained by the
Group. The right-of-use lease asset is depreciated on a straight line
basis over the period of the lease. Costs incurred with a lease that are
not part of the cost of the right-of-use lease asset are expensed.

The Group leases various properties for the packing and cooling
of kiwifruit, orchard leases to grow kiwifruit and avocados, and
equipment and vehicle leases. The terms of the leases vary, with land
and building leases ranging from 10 - 15 years, with one 99 year lease.
Orchard leases range from 5 - 15 years, and equipment and vehicle
leases range from 1 - 3 years.
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. In
the case of orchard leases, only the fixed rental is recognised as a
lease liability. Any variable consideration relating to profit share on
the orchard leases is not accounted for as the profit share is only
determined after a crop has been harvested and is not identifiable
at the commencement of the lease. Lease terms are negotiated on
an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and
conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other
than the security interest in the leased assets that are held by the lessor.
Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
The Group is exposed to potential future increases in land and building
lease payments based on contractual market rent reviews that are not
included in the lease liability until the rent review takes place.

All leases have been classified into one of the following asset classes:
– Land and building - leases for rental of all properties, including
packhouses and coolstores
– Orchard - leases held for the development of productive orchards
– Equipment - leases for equipment, including plant equipment and
forklifts
– Motor vehicles - three year leases for motor vehicles

Lease payments are allocated between principal and lease interest.
The lease interest is charged to the statement of financial performance
over the term of the lease.

Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 16
The Group has adopted NZ IFRS 16 fully retrospectively. All numbers in the financial statements have been restated to reflect the standard as if
it has always applied. The leases the Group recognises under NZ IFRS 16 were previously recognised as operating leases under NZ IAS 17 and
were previously disclosed as a commitment in the notes to the financial statements. These operating leases are now restated as right-of-use lease
assets and lease liabilities. The Group also restated one intangible asset, being the lease interest in land, which is now incorporated into the rightof-use lease asset, so has been removed from the opening balance on restatement. The opening adjustment to recognise the right-of-use lease
asset and lease liability has been recognised in retained earnings, net of the deferred tax impact.

trees not yet received. These were classed as non current prepaid deposits in December 2018 and are now receivable within the next 12 months
(Dec 2018 - $1.4m).
Accrued income and other sundry receivables include income to be received from orcharding operations over leased and owned orchards relating to
481 hectares (Dec 2018 - 442 hectares).
Within current trade receivables, $2.13m are past due (Dec 2018 - $1.12m), of which 2.6% are more than 90 days (Dec 2018 - 2.0%). Noncurrent trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up
to five years.
The purchase of Aongatete Coolstores Limited has increased debtors and accrued income by a combined $0.78m (Dec 2018 - Nil).
A $0.13m provision for doubtful debts was recognised in the accounts (Dec 2018 - $0.51m).

Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.

All of the Group’s term loans are on interest-only repayment terms, with the exception of the $6.4m Rabobank loan, which requires a $0.5m
annual payment of principal.
Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect the term
portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates via the use of derivatives, see note 30.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Grower loyalty share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share
scheme, whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares based on their orchard's current or forecast production. This issue of up
to 2.6m shares was approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
In April 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 405 participating growers. The issue price of $4.76 per share
was funded by the Group making a $9.8m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying all
product from the participating orchards for three consecutive seasons, participating growers can elect to pay the outstanding balance of their
loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.
Employee share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible employees to participate in a five-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would
be allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business. In April 2019, 568,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf
of 319 participating employees. The issue price of $4.76 per share was funded by the Group making a $2.7m non-interest-bearing loan to the
trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can elect to pay
the outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

19. Business combination
a. Purchase of shares in Aongatete Coolstores Limited
During the year the Group purchased 100% of the shares in Aongatete Coolstores Limited, a kiwifruit post harvest business based north of
Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. The business owns packhouse and coolstore facilities and operates an orchard management
business. The purchase was completed 18 March 2019 for a purchase price of $14m.
The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

The goodwill was allocated to the post harvest and orchard segments and is attributable to the operation’s strong position in the Bay of Plenty and
synergies expected to arise after adding additional post harvest and orchard facilities to Seeka’s operations. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired
in the foreseeable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of $0.20m were included in
administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $2.9m was provided in relation to differences between tax values and the fair value of certain assets.
Land and buildings were valued using an independent valuation completed by Telfer Young Valuers using the same approach as other land and
buildings detailed in note 10.

b. Purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited
During the period ended 31 December 2018, the Group purchased Kerikeri-based kiwifruit orchards, packhouse facilities and related assets and
liabilities representing the kiwifruit business previously owned by T&G Global Limited. The transaction was completed in two stages. The first
stage was the purchase of the packhouse facilities and related assets on 30 April 2018. The second stage was the purchase of the orchards from
30 June 2018. One orchard remained subject to subdivision at 31 December 2018 and was settled in June 2019. This orchard remained at the risk
of T&G Global Limited until the relevant individual titles were issued.

The goodwill was allocated to the post harvest and orchard segments and is attributable to the post harvest operation's strong position and
profitability in the Northland market and synergies expected to arise from adding the packhouse to Seeka's operations. The goodwill is not
expected to be impaired in the foreseeable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of
$0.41m were included in administrative expenses.
Seeka purchased the Northland orchards with the intention to market them for sale with supply commitments for fruit packing to Seeka. Seeka is
focussed on refurbishing and operating the post harvest facility as part of its post harvest business operations. See note 9 for details.

The calculations for 2018 earnings and net tangible assets per share were adjusted for the November 2018 rights issue. As a result of the capital
raise, a bonus element is applied to the calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

Share reserve
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
– An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
– An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust deed
established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from
the sale of shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.

Grower loyalty share scheme
Under the grower loyalty share schemes shares are issued to a share trust in return for a debt owned back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvests through to 31 March 2022. The option
benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the grower has an option to settle any
outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to them. Alternatively the grower can elect not to have the shares transferred
to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from the sale of
shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.

For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust of behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The values of the employee share scheme and grower loyalty share scheme require estimates to be made of expected price volatility and
the risk free rate as detailed in this note.

46

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Accounting policies
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for
the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement
of financial performance with a corresponding increase in the share
reserve. For the Grower Loyalty Share Scheme (GLSS), the fair value of
the grower loyalty received in exchange for the grant of the option is
recognised as a discount against revenue in the statement of financial
performance with a corresponding increase in share reserve. The
fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the options
granted, calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model, excluding
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example,
profitability and sales growth targets).
When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those
shares is transferred to retained earnings.
Employee share scheme shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion
at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average
Price (VWAP) calculation of the Company's shares during the period

prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued
with further shares if that issue would result in the ESS having an
interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.
Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme
trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the
debt between ESS and GLSS and the Group on behalf of the employee.
Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited
to share capital when payment for the shares is received.
The ESS and GLSS have a non-beneficial interest in all the shares
allocated to employees and growers. Annually the Group reviews the
ESS scheme and decides upon the allocation of further shares and the
price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS
and GLSS are appointed for an unspecified term and may be removed
by the Company at any time.
Shares held by ESS and GLSS carry the same voting rights as other
issued ordinary shares.

Total dividend paid

The dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend
reinvestment plan. Cash dividend payment was $6.31m (Dec 2018: $3.64m).
On 25 February 2020, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend comprises a normal dividend of $0.08 per
share (following Board policy on a pre NZ IFRS 16 basis) and a special dividend of $0.04 cents per share following the completion of property
sales negotiated in 2019 and completed in 2020.
The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 17 April 2020 to those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 20 March 2020. The dividend
reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price. This dividend will bring the total dividends distributed in the last 12 months to $0.24
(prior twelve months $0.24).

Accounting policies
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the period but not distributed at balance date.

Zespri share sale
In September 2018 the Group sold all shares held in Zespri. The shares were valued at $5.8m at the time of sale, with a gain of $0.27m being
recognised in other comprehensive income during the year. When the Group adopted NZ IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018, the investment in Zespri
shares was designated as fair value through other comprehensive income.

Accounting policies
The fair values of the listed securities are based on the securities' closing share price at balance date. Where pricing information is available,
unlisted securities are revalued at balance date. All other unlisted securities are currently held at cost less impairment as it reasonably represents
current fair value. The carrying amount of all unlisted securities have been reviewed at balance date and any impairment is recognised through the
statement of comprehensive income to the extent of any related reserve available and then through the statement of financial performance.

Investment in associates

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the voting
rights in the entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost.
The Group's share of associates' profits or losses are recognised in the statement of financial performance and the carrying amount of the
investment in the statement of financial position.
Dividends received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

28. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to
producing and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate
financial risks related to credit, liquidity and capital risk. The Group
operates a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation programme
via its audit and risk committee.
The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value
and maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources are
available for the development of the Group’s business whilst managing
its financial risks.

a. Risk management strategies related to orchard and
retail operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production
and market returns. The main production risks are climatic events,
diseases and pests. These impact on volume and quality of produce
from the Group's orchards, volumes to post harvest (both from Group
operations and independent growers) and volumes available to the
retail business.
Market risks include price and exchange rate impact on orchard
operations (the amount the Group is paid for growing crops) and
impact on retail revenues where the Group imports and sells produce,
mainly bananas. The exchange rate risk on imports is managed
through the use of foreign exchange contracts to match known and
planned purchases. Market risks do not directly impact on post harvest
operations, as charges are normally set prior to harvest and deducted
before sales revenues are paid to supplying growers.
The Group operates in four regions spread over two countries; New
Zealand's Northland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty, and in
Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce lines are
kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears and avocados, with small
production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail activities
are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce), Australia
and Asia. The Group's geographical, product and market spread limits
the impact on Group operations from an adverse event occurring in a
specific region, produce or market. To further mitigate risks, the Board
uses the following strategies.
Production risks - climatic events, disease and pests
The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production risks.
This includes orchard management practices to optimise production
from Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure post harvest
and retail services are suitably resourced to manage each season's
crop volumes.
In New Zealand the major climatic risks are hail, frost, storm damage and
drought.
– Hail events are typically highly localised, and for kiwifruit the Group
has access to industry hail insurance for its orchard operations,
plus top-up payments from a Seeka Growers Limited hail insurance
programme.
– Frost events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including active frost management
on kiwifruit orchards operated by the Group and other growers
supplying the Group's post harvest operations.
– Storm events are typically regional, and the Group advocates
best-practice crop protection, including shelter belts on all orchards
operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's
post harvest operations.
– Drought events are typically regional, and the Group has invested in
irrigation in many of its orchards.

periods of extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority
responsible for risk assessment and management of fire events.
The Group takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk
including removing excess vegetation from Group properties.
All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest
incursions. The kiwifruit vine disease Pseudomonas syringae pv.
actinidiae (Psa) is widespread throughout New Zealand, and is being
actively managed. In 2018 Psa was detected on 4.5 hectares of the
company's orchards in Australia. Seeka has moved to contain the
outbreak and works to proactively monitor the orchards. The brown
marmorated stink bug is also a potential threat to the horticulture
industry. To minimise the risk of crop loss the Group monitors its
orchards and undertakes recognised spray programmes to protect
crops to the fullest extent possible. Seeka also relies on the Ministry
for Primary Industries to protect New Zealand's borders from
introduced diseases.
Seeka has a sustainability team that are developing a framework to
report on key sustainability targets and measures and consider the
impact of climate change, see the report on page 66.
Market returns
New Zealand kiwifruit
The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit
harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing activities
beyond Australia are undertaken by Zespri Group Limited (Zespri)
under statutory regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the
level of Zespri's market returns which impact on the Group's orchard
profitability. The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling
techniques to analyse current and projected orchard income. This
information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease
terms.
New Zealand avocado and kiwiberry
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocado and
kiwiberry, with half of kiwiberry sales and all avocado sales managed
by the Group's retail operations. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns. This information is used when
setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.
The Group has no direct currency risk from export sales as it does not
own the products but acts as the growers’ agent.
Imported tropical produce
The Group has a direct market, price and currency risk from imported
fruit produce (banana, pineapple and papaya) where the Group
imports fruit produce for sale as the principal through its supply
and sale contracts. The Group may hedge up to the total known and
projected cash flows to manage exchange risk. The Group has no
material direct price and currency risk from imported fruit produce
where the supply agreement enables the Group to amend its purchase
price according to trading conditions.
Australian produce
The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all
Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian
operations. As the largest single grower and supplier of Australian
kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong
relationships with key retailers. The Group forecasts seasonal supply,
monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around
the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to
optimise market access and returns.

In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As the
owner and operator of all orchards supplying its Australian operations,
the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total production base.
The orchards are located on three sites in the Mundoona region.

Seeka Australia is the Group’s single major international operation,
exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk
includes future commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net
investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed through
borrowings in Australian dollars.

– Drought events are typically regional, and to secure adequate
irrigation, the Group has purchased extensive, long-term water
shares from a reliable irrigation programme.

b. Credit risk

– Hail events are typically localised, and the Group currently has hail
cloth protecting one orchard.
– Fire risk is typically from serious grass wild-fire occurring during
SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
customers, including outstanding receivables, derivative financial
instruments and committed transactions.

The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if
counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The
Group's maximum exposure is the carrying amount of the respective
recognised financial assets as stated in the consolidated statement of
financial position.

harvest services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is
therefore not considered significant.
Trade receivables
The Group applies the NZ IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring
expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance
for all trade receivables.

For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their
subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require any
collateral or security to support financial instruments due to the
quality of the financial institutions.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been
grouped based on days past due. The expected loss rates are based on
the payment profiles of sales over a 12 month period before 31 December
2019 and the corresponding historical credit losses during this period,
adjusted for any significant known amounts that are not receivable.

For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals
predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post
On that basis, the following table details the loss allowance.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure
that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity
requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.
When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.
At balance date, the Group had $139.6m (Dec 2018 - $142.1m) of available credit of which $119.7m (Dec 2018 - $75.6m) was drawn. All credit
lines are currently provided by two finance providers.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by
its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings times
interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of
its lending covenants.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through
incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position
either as investment in shares and water shares within intangible
assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industryrelated entities, only some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other
variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and
equity reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits
of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures
are deemed necessary.

New Zealand dollars

-1 %

The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through other
comprehensive income or the statement of financial performance
whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance was available. When
no such reserve existed, any related loss is processed directly in the
statement of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are
utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and
long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps
to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as
effective hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.
The following table details interest rate and price sensitivity of
the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their impact on the
statement of financial performance or equity. Cash and advance
balances do not attract interest and are not subject to pricing risk,
and are therefore excluded from this analysis.

The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
The different levels are defined as:
– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited and water shares.
– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
when determining an appropriate price.

Accounting policies
Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be
estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes. Fair value measurements are categorised into a three-level
hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation techniques
used.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such
as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and investment in shares)
is based on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The
quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the
current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial
liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active
market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined
using valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses the
appropriate method and makes assumptions that are based on market
conditions at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer
quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments
held.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows. Other techniques, such as
estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for
the remaining financial instruments.
Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade
receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values
due to their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and
liabilities with unobservable (level 3 inputs) reflect the assumptions
that market participants would use when determining an appropriate
price; additional disclosure is provided for the inputs and assumptions
used in such cases.
Land and buildings
Fair value is based on an annual revaluation, which is performed
on land and buildings based on a rolling three-year cycle by an
independent valuer, with approximately one third of land and buildings
assets valued each year using four different approaches as described
in note 10.

The fair values of the interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts are determined by Westpac and reviewed by the Board.
The gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income
appear in the statement of financial performance.
Hedge ineffectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge
relationship and through annual prospective effectiveness
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between
the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms

Accounting policies

as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates,
maturities and notional amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of
its loans, therefore the hedged item is identified as a proportion of the
outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the swaps.
Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:
– the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps
which is not matched by the loan, and
– differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans.
There was no material ineffectiveness during 2019 or 2018 in relation
to the interest rate swaps.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging

Cash flow hedge

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their
fair value at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised
as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative
is designated and effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the
hedge relationship. Derivatives are classified as current or non-current
based on the effective date.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge
relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,
exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging
instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time
remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement
of financial performance. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported
in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the
statement of financial performance within other gains / (losses).

Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At
the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.

56

Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation
technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are
applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are based on
quoted market rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by Westpac.

Accounting policies
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following
categories in accordance with NZ IFRS 9:

A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets both
of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL:

– loans and receivables,

– it is held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows; and

– assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI),

– its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding.

– assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL),
– liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and
– other financial liabilities.
The classification of financial assets and liabilities under NZ IFRS
9 is generally based on the business model in which the financial
instrument is managed and its contractual cash flows characteristics.
On initial recognition, a financial instrument is classified as measured
at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for
trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent
changes in the investment’s fair value in other comprehensive income.
The election is made on an investment by investment basis.
All financial instruments not classified as measured at amortised cost
or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.

Financial instruments are not reclassified subsequent to their initial
recognition unless the Group changes its business model in which case
all affected financial instruments are reclassified on the first day of the
first reporting period following the change in the business model.

Independent auditor’s report
To the shareholders of Seeka Limited
We have audited the consolidated financial statements which comprise:
•
•
•
•
•
•

the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019;
the statement of financial performance for the year then ended;
the statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;

IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand)
(ISAs (NZ)) and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated
financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (Revised)
Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (PES 1) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance
Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements.
Our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of taxation compliance and consulting
services, tax pooling services, and remuneration benchmarking. The provision of these services has not

Our audit approach
Overview
An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
Overall Group materiality: $2,270,000, which represents approximately 1%
of revenue.
We chose revenue as the benchmark for our materiality as we consider this
is an appropriate measure of performance of the Group. The Group
operates in a high-volume low margin industry where net profit is not
representative of the scale of the Group.
We have determined that there are three key audit matters:
•

Valuation of Biological Assets - crop

•

Valuation of Land and Buildings

•

Australian assets classified as held for sale and allocation of goodwill

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out
above. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit,
the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both
individually and in aggregate on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
Audit scope
We designed our audit by assessing the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial
statements and our application of materiality. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of
management override of internal controls including among other matters, consideration of whether
there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
We audited the New Zealand, Australian and newly acquired Aongatete business of the Group at a
materiality level calculated by reference to a portion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative
scale of the business concerned or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes
where the statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit
matter

Valuation of Biological Assets - crop
The total value of biological assets at balance
date was $18.6 million. Biological assets are
disclosed in note 12 of the consolidated
financial statements and comprise the crops
on the vines and trees in the Group’s leased
and owned orchards. Certain assumptions
and inputs are also disclosed in note 29 to
the consolidated financial statements.
Biological assets are recorded at fair value.
The method to determine fair value depends
on the degree of biological transformation
(the maturity of the fruit) at balance date. As
at 31 December 2019, a total of $18.1 million
(97%) of biological assets used cost as a proxy
for fair value because of insufficient
biological transformation.
In determining the fair value of the biological
assets, management exercises judgement
utilising industry knowledge and internal
expertise in determining the level of
biological transformation at balance date. We
therefore consider this to be a key audit
matter. When insufficient biological
transformation has occurred, the fair value is
the costs incurred at balance date to grow the
crops (provided the costs are considered
recoverable).
For those biological assets where cost has
been used as a proxy for fair value,
management assessed the recoverability of
capitalised costs by comparing the carrying
amount to budgeted costs at year end and
ensuring that actual costs incurred plus costs
to be incurred in order to get the crop to
market did not exceed budgeted revenues
from the sale of the crops less selling costs.
Management uses historical results and
anticipated crop levels as a basis for
budgeted revenues. An impairment is
recognised when the actual costs incurred
plus costs to be incurred in order to get the
crop to market exceed budgeted revenues
less selling costs.

PwC

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Our audit focused on the biological assets valued at
cost, being the most significant component of the
balance. We have evaluated judgements applied by
management to determine the crop value including
the degree of biological transformation, the
attribution of costs capitalised to the following
year’s crop and the recoverability of capitalised
costs.
Our audit procedures included:
• Gaining an understanding of the crop life cycle
and growth periods with reference to relevant
independent horticultural industry information
to determine the appropriateness of
management’s assessment of biological
transformation.
•

Testing a sample of expenses that were
capitalised to determine whether capitalisation
was valid and directly related to the
unharvested crop at 31 December 2019.

•

Testing the mathematical accuracy of the
models used by management in their
calculation of the fair value of the crops.

•

Reviewing management’s assessment of the
recoverability of capitalised costs. Our
procedures included comparing the expected
market return per hectare determined by
management to the historical and expected
number of trays that can be produced per
hectare based on the land that is currently
owned and leased. We assessed whether any
variances between historical and expected
volumes are consistent with our understanding
of planned changes in the Group’s operations.
Additionally, we compared the future selling
price used by management in their model to
available industry information.

•

Evaluating the historical accuracy of
management’s forecasted information through
comparing prior year forecast to actual results.

We had no matters to report as a result of our
procedures.

Valuation of Land and Buildings
As reflected in notes 10 and 29 of the
consolidated financial statements, the Group
has a policy of revaluing their land and
buildings on a three-year rolling cycle
(excluding assets under construction). At
each balance date approximately one third of
the New Zealand Group’s properties are
revalued by an independent external valuer
using a combination of four different
approaches in concert to arrive at a fair
value. The Group’s Australian land and
buildings were all independently revalued on
31 December 2019.

Our audit of the land and buildings of the Group
focused on the judgements inherent in the
valuation of those assets.
Our procedures included:
• Assessing the objectivity and competence of
management’s internal valuation experts and
third party valuers, in addition to assessing the
independence of the third party valuers utilised
by management.
•

Utilising our PwC valuation expert, we have
assessed key assumptions used in the external
valuations by comparing the valuation
assumptions and inputs used, such as
capitalisation and discount rates, to externally
available data. Where external data was not
available, our internal valuation expert has
utilised his experience and knowledge to
determine whether the assumptions used by
the third party valuer were reasonable and
appropriate in the circumstances.

•

Reviewing and challenging management’s
assessment of the carrying values of the New
Zealand land and buildings not independently
revalued during 2019 by comparing our own
independent assessment of valuation ranges
using our PwC valuation expert.

The Group then utilises their internal
valuation expertise to evaluate whether,
based on the results of the third party
valuations and other recent market data, the
remaining New Zealand asset values remain
appropriate and materially reflect fair value.
The total value of the Group’s land and
buildings at year end is $154.5 million.
We included the valuation of land and
buildings as a key audit matter because of the
level of judgment inherent in the valuations.

We had no matters to report as a result of our
procedures.

Key audit matter
Australian assets held for sale and
allocation of goodwill
As described in Note 9, during the year the
Group has classified three of its Australian
orchards as held for sale assets. The Group’s
intention is to enter into a sale and leaseback
transaction which will transfer substantially
all of the risks and benefits associated with
the assets to the purchaser.
The assets were designated as held for sale
on 1 September 2019 and at balance date
continue to be classified as current assets
held for sale.
At the date the assets are classified as held
for sale, a portion of the total Australia cash
generating unit goodwill of $5.4 million is
allocated to the disposal group. Management
has used a discounted cash flow methodology
to estimate the relative fair values of the
goodwill disposal group and the Australian
assets being retained, and judgmentally
determined that all of the Australia goodwill
should be allocated to the disposal group.

How our audit addressed the key audit
matter
Our audit procedures included:
• Gaining an understanding of management’s
intentions and the proposed terms and
economic substance of an anticipated sale and
leaseback arrangement.
•

Reviewing board minutes, advertising and
marketing materials and broker updates to
assess whether the conditions to classify the
assets as held for sale were met.

•

Considering the appropriateness of the
classification of the disposal group as held for
sale by assessing whether, in substance, the
intended sale and leaseback transaction is
reasonably expected to transfer substantially all
the risks and rewards associated with the assets
to a buyer.

•

Challenging management’s assumptions and
estimates made with regard to the goodwill
allocation to the disposal group, which
included:
o

This matter is significant to our audit
because the allocation of all goodwill to the
disposal group is material, involves
management judgement, and removes the
requirement for separate impairment testing
of this goodwill.

•

Agreeing the cash flows included in
management’s valuation model to the
board approved five year plan
o Evaluating the key cash flow assumptions
used by obtaining from management a
detailed analysis of the forecast production
yields, sales prices, costs and margins for
the various fruit varieties. We have
compared this information to historical
outcomes and current market prices
o Visiting the Australian orchards to
physically inspect their condition and stage
of development
o Performing a sensitivity analysis across a
range of reasonably possible changes in the
discount rate, cash flow assumptions and
terminal growth rate
o Reviewing the methodology used and
testing the mathematical accuracy of the
calculations.
Considering the presentation and disclosure in
the consolidated financial statements.

We had no matters to report as a result of our
procedures.

Information other than the consolidated financial statements and auditor’s report

The Directors are responsible for the annual report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements does not cover the other information included in the annual report and we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion on the other information.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information
that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report
in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate
the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is
located at the External Reporting Board’s website at:

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
SEEKA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
Seeka's core operation is growing, packing and supplying healthy produce to world markets. We are the guardians of more than
1000 hectares of producing orchards, and care for the produce and financial returns of more than 500 landowners. From orchard
development and management, to supply chain infrastructure and operations, we work with a wide range of stakeholders as we
collectively supply healthy produce.
As we work to generate wealth from prime horticultural land, our grower clients, staff, contractors, communities, consumer
clients and investors rely on Seeka to provide safe and sustainable business practices. This includes helping our stakeholders
certify supply operations to the international GLOBALG.A.P. standard for good agricultural practice. In line with the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), GLOBALG.A.P. demonstrates our commitment to care for the land, our people
and its produce, and Seeka has embraced the GLOBALG.A.P. GRASP module that focuses on worker health, safety and welfare.
As a land-based operation, Seeka knows how our environment influences orchard health and the volumes and the quality of the
fruit we handle each season, and we are using this information as we understand the impact of climate change. Seeka's inaugural
sustainability report documents our efforts to measure then incrementally improve our environmental and social performance,
and the associated governance processes.

Sustainability team and process
While Seeka's core business is kiwifruit, our operations extend along the full supply chain from vine to shelf. From bareland
development to the processing of consumer lines, we work to extract the best value from the land and its produce. Our products
include avocados, kiwiberry, nashi, pears, citrus and berries as we strive to offer a better service to our grower and consumer
clients, and make better use of our facilities, supply chain systems and workforce.
The extension of our supply chain system and expansion of products has created a multi-disciplined team. To capture this
expertise and apply it to our sustainability programme, we have implemented Seeka's Agile Sustainability Team (SAST). Drawing
together staff that are passionate about sustainability from all areas of our operations, SAST is working with external advisors
and taking guidance from regional and national experts to develop Seeka's environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy
and processes.
Our Agile approach and SAST team are using a stepped process to deliver incremental improvements.
1. Define what sustainability means for Seeka
2. Identify key inputs and outputs of Seeka's operations
3. Quantify inputs and outputs using available data
4. Identify and rank areas for environmental, social and governance improvements
5. Prioritise actions that deliver incremental improvements
6. Evaluate how Seeka's sustainability actions have impacted our ESG position
A key contributor to the success of our ESG programme is to engage and involve all staff and key stakeholders in our journey, and
to incorporate their insights and expertise. This includes publicising our progress and celebrating our wins.

Water - Seeka uses water to grow crops, in the post harvest value chain, and to deliver corporate services.

Focus on waste reduction
SAST has identified waste minimisation as a key objective to deliver immediate gains to Seeka's operations and incrementally
improve the company's ESG position. This includes identifying and replicating best practice within our organisation, and diverting
waste product to recycling initiatives.

Step 3. Quantify inputs and outputs using available data
For each of the key inputs, SAST are currently developing a framework to guide ESG policy and actions. Each framework will include
a small number of achievable projects to be undertaken in 2020.

Next steps
In 2020, SAST will draw on the information collated in the input frameworks to progressively develop a formal ESG reporting
framework. The objective is to develop consistent reporting so stakeholders can understand how Seeka is adapting our business to
manage risk and take advantage of new opportunities in our every-changing operating environment. The three elements to Seeka's
reporting framework will be:
–

Environmental - how we steward the land and our natural resources

–

Social - how we manage relations with stakeholders, including employees, grower clients, our communities and our retail
partners

–

Governance - how we govern our business, manage risk, realise opportunities and comply with relevant legislation and
stakeholder expectations

To aid stakeholder engagement, Seeka will develop ESG reporting in line with one of the three global reporting frameworks
commonly used in New Zealand and Australia; Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Integrated Reporting, or UN Global Compact
(UNGC).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As at 31 December 2019
At Seeka, we conduct our business safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best outcomes for our
growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.
Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the NZX Corporate Governance Code 2020
(the Code) as set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews Seeka's corporate governance structures against the eight
principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures substantially meet Code recommendations. Any exceptions
are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 78 of this annual report.
Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/co.nz/corporate-governance.
The Board approved this governance statement on 26 February 2020.

Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
followed throughout the organisation.”
Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.
Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”
Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are promoted
to staff each year including at staff meetings. The code outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and
model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”
The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:
• Conflicts of interest
• Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property
• Dealing with gifts or gratuities
• Respecting all stakeholders
• Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing
• Compliance with laws and Seeka policies
• Managing any breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics
Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy prohibiting the direct or indirect dealing of Seeka securities when holding inside information, plus a duty
of confidentiality that protects the dissemination and use of confidential company information.
The Insider Trading Policy includes a black-out period during which restricted persons are prohibited in trading in Seeka shares unless provided with
a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to and finishes the first trading day after key events; being the half-year
and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares. Restricted persons includes all
directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts and companies controlled by such
persons, and advisors.
Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chairman, and the chairman must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.
No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.

Principle 2. Board composition and performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”
Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interests of the company, deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

70

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board’s charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the
duties and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:
• Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards
• Establishing corporate objectives and strategies
• Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies
• Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance
• Managing risk to Seeka’s business
• Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication
The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.

Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth
to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings. Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives
and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between
governance and management, all directors are non-executive and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.
Seeka’s Board currently has seven directors, led by the independent chairman Fred Hutchings. Non-independent director Amiel Diaz is the only
director residing overseas.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.
Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;
• Amiel Diaz, representative of Seeka’s shareholder Farmind Corporation of Japan, and
• Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chairman of the Ngai Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit
grower supplying Seeka.
As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors have extensive
experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their extensive interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are considered nonindependent directors;
• Martyn Brick
• John Burke, and
• Ratahi Cross

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

71

The Board has three independent directors;
• Fred Hutchings, chairman
• Ashley Waugh, audit and risk committee chairman, and
• Cecilia Tarrant.

Director appointments and induction
As required, the chairman establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.
Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the company’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
Board.

Director profiles
Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 79 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 81 of this annual report.

Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.
The Board works to optimise diversity across director members, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity in
culture and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key clients,
creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns.
With Seeka’s key client groups diversely spread from rural New Zealand to large urban centres, Seeka’s Board has encompassed cultural, ethnic and
gender diversity to strengthen business governance:
• Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is also a lecturer in Māori history
• Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia
• Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural backgrounds

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Professional development
Directors are supported to undertake professional development through individual training and by attending relevant courses. In 2019 the Board also
met with experts in produce marketing and governance.

Evaluation of board and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chairman undertakes an annual review of Board and director performance. The chairman's 2019 review found
that the Board and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified by the Board Charter.

Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”
The Board has established two permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.
All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the remuneration and nominations committee charters biennially and the audit and risk committee charter annually.

Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board with three independent directors. To provide effective and transparent committee
governance, while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent
director, with committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill set. The audit and risk
committee charter specifies a majority of independent directors.
The current standing committees are:

making.

1. Following a change in the audit and risk committee charter, Fred Hutchings was appointed a full member of the audit and risk committee 24 July 2019. Prior to this he
attended five of six meetings as an ex-officio member.
2. Martyn Brick retired from the audit and risk committee 24 July 2019.

Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”
Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a midyear performance update, along with regular operational updates to supplying clients.
Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chairman, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for identifying
material information between Board meetings, with continuous disclosure covered at every Board meeting.
As stewards of more than 300 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and international
guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P standard for good
agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food. See www.globalgap.org.
Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.
In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit value;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.
Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides management
support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational performance for their
fruit.
Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. Seeka also supports environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any environmental factors that may
materially affect operations.
In 2019 Seeka implemented a sustainability team to develop Seeka's environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy and processes. Drawing
together staff that are passionate about sustainability from all areas of our operations, and working with external advisors including regional and
national experts, Seeka's sustainability team has started developing a formal ESG reporting framework. Our objective is to develop consistent
reporting so stakeholders can understand how Seeka is adapting our business to manage risk and take advantage of new opportunities in our everychanging operating environment. The three elements to Seeka's reporting framework will be:
74

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

– Environmental - how we steward the land and our natural resources and consider the impact of climate change
– Social - how we manage relations with stakeholders, including employees, grower clients, our communities and our retail partners
– Governance - how we govern our business, manage risk, realise opportunities and comply with relevant legislation and stakeholder expectations

Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chairman uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration
within a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in
April 2018, when the pool limit was set at $450,000 per annum. Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according to expected time
commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board. Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and receive no performance or
retirement benefits. Directors are not required to own Seeka shares.
The following table reports the allocation of the pool at the date of this report, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. No other benefits
were remunerated to directors during the year.

Chief executive officer remuneration
The review of the chief executive’s remuneration is undertaken by the remunerations committee with the remuneration package the responsibility of
the Board.
Michael Franks was appointed chief executive in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual remuneration that covers base salary,
vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.

Franks earned an $247,500 performance incentive. This payment was made in 2019.
For the 2019 financial year, the chief executive officer earned a $114,064 performance incentive. This payment will be made in 2020.

Employee share scheme
In May 2019, 8,000 shares allocated under the 2016 employee share scheme at $3.88 per share vested and were paid for by the chief executive for a
total consideration of $27,040 ($3.38 per share).
At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated April 2019 at $4.76 per share under the employee share scheme. These shares vest
2022.

Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”
The Board consider risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate control of risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific focus on
material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.
While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
Principles and Guidelines.
Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
performance against budget and forecasts.
The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian produce handling
and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating
environments when assessing material risk.
The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated with
being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing revenue
from more points along the value chain. Since the incursion of the kiwifruit vine-killing disease Psa in 2010, Seeka has transformed from being a New
Zealand kiwifruit handler to become an Australasian produce business involved in the growing, handling, supply and marketing of multiple products.
Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post harvest, processing and fruit handling facilities, along with
insurance cover for hail damage to crops.
The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB; Halyomorpha halys) remains one of the top pests of concern for New Zealand's horticultural industry. A
native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and accidentally introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s, adult BMSB feed on fruit and make them
unmarketable. The Ministry of Primary Industries is working with industry groups along with the public to prevent the unintended import of BMSB,
including eradication protocols if BMSB are detected in New Zealand. Seeka personnel and supplying growers are informed on how to identify BMSB
and the immediate actions to be undertaken if the pest is found.

Health and safety
Operating in a seasonal industry, in 2019 Seeka employed more than 3,000 people working in multiple complex environments. This includes 24-hour
operations over the harvest period. Group salary and wages equate to 1,245 full time equivalents.
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.
The following table reports key health and safety measures and targets in 2019.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 | SEEKA LIMITED

Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”
Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the markets
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.
The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external
audit process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk
committee:
• Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and
• Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.
For financial year 2019, Pip Cameron of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for Seeka Limited. PwC has confirmed its
independence to the audit and risk committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the reporting period. The last audit partner
rotation was in FY16.
PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.

Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
external audit findings.
Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated financial audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s financial systems.
Directors also pay particular attention to matters raised by PwC, the external auditor.

Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”
Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering excellence to all stakeholders.
The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
• Annual and interim reports
• Market announcements
• Annual shareholder meeting
• Mid-year stakeholder meeting
• Ad-hoc investor presentations
• Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type
• Quarterly staff updates
• Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors
• Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team
Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update, where they can raise matters for
discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which affect Seeka at the annual shareholder meeting. Voting
is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the company’s auditor PwC, on a one share, one vote principle.
Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar Link
Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. The annual shareholders notice of meeting is posted on the NZX website and sent to shareholders
at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzxannouncements.
When raising new capital, when practical the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company so they can
maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.
Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK

Differences in practice to NZX Code
The following table summarises the material differences between Seeka’s corporate governance and the Code during the year. Where there are
differences, these have been approved by the Board.

Principle
2. Board
Composition
and
Performance

Concerning
2.8 A majority of the board
should be independent
directors.

Period of non
compliance

Key difference
The board charter specifies a minimum of two independent directors.
As Seeka's foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers it
appropriate to have a mix of directors with extensive experience in kiwifruit
production and handling, who in the normal course of business would supply
Seeka with produce from their ongoing orcharding interests. The Board must
also appropriately represent large shareholders.

At all relevant
times

The specified minimum of two independent directors provides the flexibility
to meet these two criteria, while also ensuring Board decisions reflect the
best interests of Seeka and its security holders.
Currently, four directors are deemed non-independent; two for their
extensive interests in orchards that supply Seeka (industry expertise),
one an appointee of a large shareholder (market expertise), and one that
has extensive interests in orchards that supply Seeka as well as being an
appointee of a large shareholder (industry expertise).
Three of the seven directors (a minority) are independent.

Committees

3.1

Audit and risk committee

2019, Fred Hutchings, who is an independent director, was appointed a full
member of the audit and risk committee, and non-independent director
Martyn Brick retired from the committee. The audit and risk committee
currently complies with the code by having a majority of independent
directors.

1 January 2019 to
24 July 2019

Prior to the charter change, to manage work load across the Board and best
utilise skills, the audit and risk committee had an independent chair and two
non-independent directors.
3.3

Remuneration committee
should have a majority of
independent directors.

To manage workload across the Board, the charter only specifies an
independent chair. The current remuneration committee, however, complies
with the code by having an independent chair, an independent director and a
non-independent director.

committee as required. To manage workload across the Board, the charter
