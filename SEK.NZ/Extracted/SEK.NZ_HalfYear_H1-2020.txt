   FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

   Seeka is proud to provide you with this report on our unaudited financial and operational results for the six months
   ended 30 June 2020. Having successfully completed harvest in a very challenging operating environment, in this report
   we comment on our results for the six months ended 30 June 2020, the impact of Covid-19 and our actions, dividend,
   outlook, a review of our business operations, strategic highlights and health and safety.

   The impacts of Covid-19, drought, a change to the fruit maturity clearance protocols and severe labour shortages all
   created unprecedented operational and financial challenges. Seeka and its people responded to these challenges with
   commitment and innovation by drawing together as a team to deliver a timely harvest to our growers and business
   continuity to our stakeholders. We appreciate and thank our management teams, staff and contractors for their stamina
   and outstanding efforts to date. Our people demonstrated tremendous leadership in successfully delivering the harvests
   of kiwifruit, avocado, kiwiberry in New Zealand, and kiwifruit, nashi, and European pears in Australia. All undertaken
   under demanding harvest circumstances and a never experienced before Covid-19 environment. We know that as a team,
   we can draw on our experience, culture and reserves to create a sustainable and profitable future for Seeka.

   The following factors impacted on Seeka’s operational and financial performance for the six months ended 30 June 2020:

   –   Covid-19 lockdown protocols increased costs and reduced early-harvest productivity and fruit flows.

   –   More than 450 experienced RSE workers were still in their home countries when the borders closed and their
       absence exacerbated a severe labour shortage within New Zealand. This shortfall led to Seeka estimating it was more
       than 800 people short in its pack house operations at peak harvest. Labour productivity was impacted and labour
       administration costs also increased.

   –   A prolonged summer drought which for the second year in a row affected the size and yield of New Zealand Hayward
       kiwifruit.

   –   Kiwifruit volumes were below expectations which reduced operational margins.

   Being a seasonal business, Seeka earns more of its income in the first six months and is carrying lower volumes of fruit
   in store into the second six months. Despite the negative financial impacts of the above factors, Seeka’s financial results
   are ahead of the same period in 2019 and our full year forecast is similar to 2019, although its composition is significantly
   different. Additionally, a change in the tax deductibility of depreciation on buildings and its effect on deferred tax has
   an unaudited one-off tax benefit of $5.6m. Seeka expects to produce higher after tax earnings for the full year. This
   demonstrates Seeka's financial and operational resilience.

   As a result of Covid-19, Seeka focussed solely on operational matters and performance. The company was allowed to
   continue to operate through lockdown and enacted processes to ensure the safety of all people, including investing in
   screens, social barriers, temperature checking, and changed its processes to ensure social distancing. The company did
   not receive any wage subsidy from the Government, outside of $27,800 to pay vulnerable people who were unable to
   work on site due to age or pre-existing medical conditions, and where working from home was not an option. Seeka paid
   $12.2m in salaries and wages and $3.0m to contractors during the lockdown period.

   The company has continued to focus on the asset sale process, with the orderly sell down of orchards held for sale.
   Northland orchard sales yielded a $2.5m gain on sale. A conditional sale and lease back of three Australian kiwifruit
   orchards for AU$26.5m, is subject to the approval of the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board, expected on or
   before 29 August 2020. Proceeds from this sale when completed will both reduce debt and release capital gains.

   The company suspended its dividend payments on March 19. At that point, the Covid-19 outbreak was creating
   fundamental uncertainty across all business sectors, both in New Zealand and internationally. Seeka was conscious of its
   debt position and determined that shareholder capital distributions should be suspended.

   Seeka has moved to embrace sustainability through the formation of a Board sub-committee and is acting to understand
   and reduce our business’s impact on the environment, including establishing a state-of-the art worm farm.

    Results for the six months ended 30 June 2020
    Key financial components of the six months include:

    –   $178.7m revenue (previous corresponding period to June 2019 (pcp):$169.9m); up 5%.

    –   $18.4m profit after tax (pcp: $11.9m); up 55%.

   Impact of Covid-19
   Summary of Covid-19's impact and Seeka’s response

   Covid-19 response committee formed prior to harvest. Including senior operational and support managers, this
   committee worked to put in place mechanisms to ensure the safety of our people. Actions included moving workers
   sourced from overseas through the RSE programme to less populated accommodation. Houses were set up in case our
   people were infected and we had to quarantine them in our own facility. Later, when a manager of a third-party local
   accommodation facility was confirmed as Covid-19 positive, Seeka used its facilities to house people until they were
   confirmed as negative. Seeka worked closely with the health professionals managing the response. The committee also
   sourced items including masks, gloves, sanitiser and thermometers well ahead of lockdown. They then set up a process of
   checking and logging people’s temperature as they came on site. Throughout harvest, Seeka’s pack houses and sites were
   established as “bubbles” with a total ban on personnel moving between facilities. The company transitioned to working
   from home and remote management.

   Covid-19 meant that many experienced overseas workers were unable to come to New Zealand to work at Seeka.
   Seeka were 450 RSE workers short, many of whom were experienced in intermediate and senior seasonal roles.
   Backpackers were also in short supply, and at its height Seeka was more than 800 seasonal workers short. Many workers
   with displaced employment were supported by the Government’s wage subsidy scheme and understandably did not
   want to risk working in a pack house. Staff turnover was very high. Nightshift, traditionally resourced by RSE workers, was
   particularly difficult to resource and one night shift machine was unable to be operated for a large part of the season.
   Recognising the commitment made by our key staff, Seeka put in place a loyalty payment to reward key roles for their
   dedication in the season. Seeka took direct action to lift its profile, employment and recruitment including campaigns on
   social media, radio and television. More recently Seeka has recruited RSE workers from the Hawke’s Bay, where their work
   had completed but they were unable to travel home, with more than 275 workers brought in to assist with our orchard
   winter work programme.

   Proactive steps to ensure safety. Seeka took numerous steps to ensure all its people were safe in addition to our ongoing
   traffic management plans and guarding upgrades. In the pack house, access and egress processes were changed so social
   distancing could be maintained at all times, additional temporary tearooms were created, gloves, masks and sanitiser
   were made available and extra 24 hour cleaning regimes adopted at all sites. No personnel were allowed to travel
   between pack houses and Seeka limited all contractors and Zespri personnel from coming on any site unless absolutely
   necessary. Seeka developed and deployed screens, as required, to ensure two metres of separation on all machines.
   Our wholesale markets continued to operate as essential services, with strict operating protocols ensuring physical
   distancing.

   Safety over production. Seeka switched pack plans to a greater bulk percentage (large boxes of fruit) and closed
   machines while it initiated screens and distancing. Production fell to 65% of normal throughputs in the first ten days
   before gradually increasing to 85% handling the normal pack mix of layered pack types.

   Eurofins withdrawal had a double-down effect. Critically, Eurofins withdrew its industry maturity testing services citing
   Covid-19 as the primary cause, its service having significantly faltered prior. This was a huge loss to the industry at the
   early stage of the harvest. Seeka, along with the other major post harvest operators, worked to deliver a solution to
   growers to enable the harvest. It should be noted that at that point there was no certainty that the crop could be entirely
   harvested or completely sold. Eurofins withdrawal led to the necessary withdrawal of dry-matter incentives which in prior
   years meant that growers self regulated their harvest based on optimal fruit maturity. Seeka lost some volume as the rush
   of growers wanting their fruit harvested exceeded the available post harvest capacity for a short period.

   So what did it cost? Seeka estimates it cost $5.3m, comprising $3.1m of direct Covid-19 costs associated with harvests
   2020 and $2.2m from volume loss from extraordinary productivity constraints.

    Dividend
    At the date of signing the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.10 per share, to be paid on 30 September
    2020 to those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 4 September 2020. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with
    a 2% discount to the strike price.

    Outlook
    Seeka is anticipating lower operational earnings for the second half of the financial year reflecting lower volumes of fruit
    in store at 30 June and an early selling season. The company has conditionally sold and leased back three Australian
    kiwifruit orchards for AU$26.5m. When completed these sales are expected to reduce debt and realise a gain on sale.
    The following guidance is based on Seeka’s best estimate on the forward six months’ earnings including the anticipated
    gain from the sale of the Australian orchards. The market will be updated if there is material deviation.

    The following table outlines Seeka’s guidance for the 12 months ended December 2020.

   Review of operations
   Financial performance
   Revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2020 increased 5.2% to $178.68m (pcp: $169.87m). Consolidated earnings
   before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $30.43m (pcp: $27.91m); up 9.1%.

   The result includes a turn-around in Seeka Australia with earnings at an EBITDA level for the six months of $1.89m
   compared to an EBITDA loss of $0.15m in the pcp. Changes made in the Australian business combined with continuing
   focus from the Australian management team have improved results.

   The six month results include a gain on sale from the disposal of held for sale orchards of $2.5m, compared against $1.2m
   in the pcp.

   Consolidated profit before tax of $17.39m compares against $16.54m in the pcp. However, a change in the deductibility
   of depreciation on buildings and its effect on deferred tax has resulted in a much higher profit after tax. Profit after tax as
   a result of the taxation benefit totals $18.38m, up 55% on the pcp, resulting in $0.57 earnings per share compared with
   $0.39 in the pcp.

   Net cash flow from operations totalled $9.41m, compared against $5.14m in the pcp.

   Seeka invested $10.51m (pcp: $25.82m) in property, plant and equipment, primarily in maintenance capital and
   continuing the Kerikeri packhouse build. The company invested $2.05m in long term leased orchards compared to
   $3.73m in the pcp.

   Sales of orchards and property held for sale totalled $10.4m (pcp: $5.4m). Sold orchards include a continuing Northland
   sale programme and the completion of an orchard unconditionally sold at 31 December 2019. Seeka still holds $19.53m in
   assets held for sale compared with $37.49m in the pcp.

   Advances to growers totalled $21.14m at 30 June, this was substantially repaid in July 2020.

   Net debt at 30 June (bank loans less bank deposits) was $129.30m (pcp: $148.08m); a decrease of $18.78m, driven by
   the planned disposals of orchards held for sale. Net debt is forecast to continue reducing as advances are repaid along
   with the continuing sale proceeds, including the conditional sale and lease back of the three Australian kiwifruit orchards.

   New Zealand orchard operations
   Seeka’s orchard operation spans from Northland through to the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast, with
   orcharding production covering the growing of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry on leased, long term leased, and Seeka-
   owned orchards. Orchard operations provides comprehensive orchard management and vine management services
   to orchard owners and Seeka develops orchards under contract for landowners or via long term leases, including in
   partnership with Iwi.

   Seeka’s orcharding operations grew 12.98m trays of kiwifruit in 2020, compared to 11.42m trays in the pcp. For the second
   year, Hayward volumes were affected by drought, being down an estimated 0.5m trays. At an average 10,200 trays per
   hectare in 2020, Hayward yields were below the five-year average of 10,800 trays per hectare. Drought affected the
   quality of the canopy tied down to grow next year’s crop and we anticipate it will take a few years for production to return
   to higher levels, even if we have good growing seasons.

   Seeka also grew 1,614,000 kilograms of avocado (pcp: 732,000 kgs) and 171,750 kilograms of kiwiberry (pcp: 64,400 kgs).

   Orchard operations revenue of $47.38m is down by $0.95m from the pcp reflecting our expectation of weaker returns
   from Zespri in 2020. EBITDA of $4.16m is in line with the prior period.

   Seeka continues to invest in long term lease arrangements with fruit volumes set to increase as these orchards reach
   maturity and outside the reported period has committed to two large scale Iwi developments supported by the Provincial
   Growth Fund.

   New Zealand post harvest operations
   Post harvest operates eight major facilities spread throughout the major growing regions in the North Island, and handles
   all produce from our orcharding operations and from our independent growers.

   In the period, 33.4m trays of kiwifruit were packed (pcp: 33.5m), down on expectation with drought affecting volumes by
   an estimated 2.4m trays combined with volumes lost in the grower harvest rush and a shortfall in capacity.

   Seeka is satisfied with the quality of its fruit in store which is performing very well compared to industry.

   During the year the company continued to redevelop the Kerikeri site, with the previous pack house demolished, new
   offices and amenities completed, and construction started on new cool stores.

   Cool store fruit loss has remained low, and this is a key measure of performance for our growers.

   The following table shows fruit loss to 12 August.

   Post harvest revenue of $108.13m is an increase of 2.7% on the pcp’s $105.29m. Post harvest costs are up across our
   industry, driven by higher wage rates and Covid-19 costs. EBITDA of $30.29m, while up on the pcp’s $29.82m, is well
   down on expectation.

   New Zealand retail services operations
   Includes the supply, export and sale of avocados, class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit and kiwiberry, sale of New Zealand
   kiwifruit through collaborative programmes, operation of the New Zealand wholesale marketing business including
   imported tropical fruits, and the manufacture and sale of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.

   EBITDA of $1.31m is 73% up on the pcp’s $0.76m. This result is from a sound strategy and good enactment of the
   plan, particularly since the business was largely closed through lockdown. Momentum continues to build with sound
   leadership and dedicated staff.

   Australia operations
   Seeka Australia PTY Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned entity, owns and operates kiwifruit, nashi and pear orchards along
   with associated post harvest facilities in Victoria, and directly markets Seeka’s Australian produce domestically and to
   export customers.

   Kiwifruit yields were again lower than expected following a very hot and dry summer which impacted fruit size; the
   kiwifruit business, however, remains profitable. Green nashi sales returned to profitability as Seeka balanced supply to
   demand. Seeka has 17 hectares of the exciting new Ricó pear coming to the market in 2021.

   Seeka has announced the conditional sale and lease back of three of its mature kiwifruit orchards for AU$26.5m. The
   sale is subject to the approval of the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board, expected in August 2020. In addition,
   and alongside the sale, Seeka has sourced and leased sufficient water to operate those orchards. The lease term is for
   an initial 10 years, with a right of renewal of 10 years followed by two additional rights of renewal of five years each.
   The monies released from the sale will be used to repay debt and finance the completion of 70 hectares of kiwifruit
   development.

   Seeka remains positive about its Australian investment strategy.

   Across all varieties Seeka is concentrating on quality and increasing yields.

   EBITDA of $1.89m compares to a loss in the pcp of $0.15m.

   Avocados and kiwiberry positive highlights
   Seeka continues to build its emerging categories of kiwiberry and avocado. Both positively contribute to Seeka’s earnings
   while delivering competitive returns to growers.

   In 2020, Seeka successfully harvested 82,000 trays of kiwiberry and marketed these both directly and in collaboration
   with Freshmax. Grower returns averaged an estimated $220,000 per hectare with the highest return over $320,000.
   This performance has seen more growers graft a portion of their orchard to kiwiberry.

   Likewise, Seeka’s avocado business continues to grow. From the 2019/2020 harvest (spanning financial year end), Seeka
   processed 765,000 trays of avocados to deliver leading grower returns that averaged $18.79 per export tray and $10.66
   per local market tray.

   These categories that are processed by Seeka are also sold by Seeka, with our brand reputation for quality creating retail
   consumer demand that generates superior returns to our growers.




SEEKA LIMITED | INTERIM REPORT JUNE 2020                                                                                        9
     Strategic highlights
     Seeka continues to enact our strategy. Necessarily, the company focused on operations through the Covid-19 lockdown.
     At the same time, Seeka was able to make significant strategic progress. Kiwifruit is our core product, with the company
     diversifying geographically and targeting complementary produce categories. The focus is on growth that delivers accretive
     value to our stakeholders, including shareholders, growers, employees, contractors and community. We work to deliver our
     marketers, principally Zespri, the highest quality fruit and deliver our growers great returns through our supply chain.

     Seeka has excelled where it operates the entire value chain from the orchard to the customer and delivered incremental
     returns to growers; as demonstrated by avocados and kiwiberry. Seeka delivers orchard-to-market excellence in New
     Zealand kiwifruit, avocados, class 2 kiwifruit, and kiwiberry, along with Australian kiwifruit, nashi and European pears.

     Seeka has focussed on consolidating its position, refining its management structures, and selling orchards with secure
     supply contracts to reset debt while pursuing operational excellence.

     The company has focussed on asset utilisation and capacity planning and has substantially built the infrastructure to
     handle the anticipated immediate volumes. Seeka has deliberately positioned itself in Northland to provide excellent
     service to the region’s growth in avocados and kiwifruit, and has actively increased its avocado market share. This has
     delivered a benefit to growers, investors and increased market share to Seeka.

     Health and safety
     The Covid-19 environment made our operations very challenging, but at no time did we compromise the health and
     safety of our people. Seeka’s focus is on continuous improvement to ensure the health and safety of all personnel at all
     our locations. All reported incidents and near-misses are followed up within the company. The company reviewed and
     enacted improved traffic management systems, new barriers at post harvest sites, new fatigue-management systems,
     and lifted its investment in machine guarding. Forklifts are now largely removed from post harvest areas where foot traffic
     is present.

     This season's lockdown placed significant load on our safety drive, which was exacerbated by the severe shortage of
     people. Seeka took all efforts to ensure that it made its people safe, in all operations, and invested in their safety.

     Disappointingly, after lockdown ended there were two post harvest serious harm incidents involving forklifts, and one
     in orchard operations involving the loading of a tractor for transportation. This impacted the severity rate in the period.
     All incidents were reviewed, including independent review of the post harvest incidents, as the company relentlessly
     drives for a safer environment. Seeka continues to refine its safety focus, and in 2020 will conduct a complete audit of its
     orchard equipment.

     The following table shows key safety measures to 30 June against annual thresholds.

                                                                                                                          To 30 June                  Annual

     The total recordable injury frequent rate (TRIFR) measures the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked. Seasonal pressures can be challenging along
     with harvest deadlines. Seeka TRIFR was 5.0 for 2019.
     Severity rate measures the average number of days that an injured person is away from work. Seeka had 3 notifiable injuries including incidents in 2019.

   Sustainability
   Seeka continued to develop its "Growing Futures" brand attribute with a focus on sustainability. A Board sub-committee
   was formed to work with and provide oversight to management as the company works to understand how it will become
   more sustainable.

   Some early and notable wins have been achieved. Seeka has purchased, installed and commissioned a new worm farm
   that will lower the volume of bio waste to landfill and will create a circular pathway for our orchards; orchard waste being
   recovered and returned to the orchard. This will reduce transport and waste costs, and improve our carbon footprint.

   Seeka has started to switch its vehicle fleet to hybrids, saving fossil fuels and reducing emissions. Solar LED lights and
   electricity load shedding are being evaluated.

   The company is moving paperless with the implementation of electronic documentation systems that will remove paper
   from the purchasing, payments and employment processes.

   Work is underway to calculate our carbon footprint. Personnel in the team are progressing the calculations and
   developing ideas to reduce the carbon footprint across our business.




                                                                           Hayward spring growth in the Te Puke region, early October.

     The Seeka team
     Seeka’s people have excelled during the extremely challenging six months to 30 June 2020.

     Seeka has continued to invest in its people to become the employer of choice in a tight labour market. The company has
     increased wages and continued to implement competitive remuneration levels.

     Seeka continues to focus on talent development and has 14 cadets, with some now emerging as qualified orchard
     managers. Wellness programmes continue to be implemented across the company.

     Seeka continues to actively source New Zealand workers to fulfil peak seasonal labour demand and operates a parallel
     recognised seasonal employer programme (RSE) that delivers focussed pastoral care for our overseas’ workers. Of our
     3,500 strong seasonal workforce, 1,073 were scheduled to come from overseas via this scheme. Seeka remains engaged
     with Government, noting that even with higher domestic unemployment, there remains insufficient local seasonal labour
     to safely undertake the harvests.

     Summary
     We are proud of how the company has performed in an unprecedented, challenging environment. Covid-19 has tested
     the resilience of our people but with their dedication and leadership across the company, the Seeka team alongside our
     community got the job done.

     The company responded to a changing climate and environment through the creation of a sustainability sub-committee
     of the Board and targeted initiatives intended to "Grow a Better Future".

     Covid-19 and drought have placed financial pressures on the company, however pleasingly our operational financial
     performance is similar to 2019, with taxation benefits lifting our after tax returns. The company awaits the FIRB decision
     on the sale and lease back of three of its orchards in Australia.

     We thank all growers, shareholders and stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willingly give to Seeka.

                                             consistent with the prior year.
                                             Seeka’s debtors are expected to remain recoverable, as they relate to the revenues earnt in a

                                             similar to the prior year and plans have all fruit loaded out by November 2020.

                                             The Northland orchards remain for sale and are held at values that are considered
                                             recoverable based on recent sales in the area.

                                             Property values were reviewed and considered supportable based on recent sales in the
                                             area and values holding firm for properties in the food production industrial portfolio.

assets                                       equipment and vehicles. The kiwifruit industry remains strong and demand for fruit produce
                                             remains high, suggesting the carrying value of these assets represents the future benefit of

                                             No underlying lease arrangements have been affected by Covid-19.

Investment in shares            No           Seeka’s investment in shares are valued at cost and are of minimal value. The value of
                                             shares is expected to be recoverable.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

At 30 June 2020, 34 hectares of Northland orchards (June 2019 - 135 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. These properties
were part of the 2018 purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited.
The assets are classified as held for sale as their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition was met when the sale became highly probable and the assets were available for immediate sale in their present
condition. The Group is committed to the sale and expects the sale to be completed within one year from the date of classification. These assets
are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell as required by NZ IFRS 5.
Assets related to the sale of three orchards in Australia (Hayward, Austral and Lakes) are also recognised as assets held for sale from 1 September
2019. All of the goodwill from the Australia CGU was allocated in 2019 to the disposal group, based on the Group's assessment of relative fair
values of the assets held for sale and Australia assets being retained.
On 20 May 2020 Seeka signed a conditional sale and lease back agreement for these orchards for AUD$26.5m. The contract is subject to the
approval of Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). The sale is expected to be completed within 12 months. The orchards will initially
be leased back for 10 years, followed by a right to renew for a second 10-year term, then two 5-year terms.


    Critical accounting estimates and judgements
    The Group has used estimates to allocate goodwill to the Australian assets held for sale, as described above.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
appropriate asset class. At 30 June 2020, assets under construction are largely related to the Kerikeri coolstore build.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus any
subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers,
ANZIV, independent registered valuer.
In Australia valuations are undertaken by Preston Rowe Paterson Shepparton (previously known as Goulburn Valley Property Services),
independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. All Australian land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2019.
As at 30 June 2020 the directors believe there are no indicators that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings differs materially
from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue those assets at 30 June 2020.



     Critical accounting estimates and judgements
     At 30 June 2020 an assessment of the carrying values of land and buildings was performed. Based on sales data and discussions with
     experts in the property valuation field, the value of Seeka’s property has not materially changed in the last six months. Seeka operates
     in the food production industry, which has remained stable due to the high demand for healthy fruit despite the Covid-19 environment.
     Furthermore, properties situated in the Bay of Plenty are expected to be less affected than other regions in New Zealand given the
     strength of the horticulture and agriculture businesses over the past six months.
     Seeka’s Australian properties are also located in the food production region of Victoria. Seeka signed a conditional sale and leaseback
     for approximately 199 hectares of orchards in Australia within a Covid-19 environment, which supports the carrying values of the
     remaining land and buildings.
     Sensitivity analysis suggests property values have moved between ($0.5m) and $1m. This is not considered a material movement in
     land and building values.

At 30 June 2020 all goodwill balances were reviewed for indicators of impairment. Based on a review of the assumptions used in the value-in-
use calculations performed at 31 December 2019, the goodwill relating to the post harvest segment is supported and the key assumptions are on
target to meet the forecasts expected for the 2020 financial year. Kiwifruit harvest volumes are in line with the previous year and packing volumes
are expected to increase in future years. Whilst Covid-19 has impacted costs and packing margins in the current financial year, the post harvest
segment operated profitably throughout the lockdown period. For these reasons, there are no indications of impairment of the goodwill relating to
Aongatete Coolstores Limited and the Northland packhouse.
The goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush business is supported by the value-in-use calculations performed at 31 December 2019, with key
assumptions supported by current trading. The business had a strong start in the first half of the year, and is expected to achieve its targets
through to the end of the year. Therefore, there are no indications of impairment of the goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush business.
SeekaFresh 2020 year started well, until sales were impacted by Covid-19. The business continued to operate as an essential service, but was
affected by the temporary closure of hospitality and independent retail based customers during the lockdown. For this reason, indicators of
impairment were present and a value in use calculation was prepared at 30 June 2020 to test for any impact on the goodwill or asset carrying
values. Using a discount rate of 8%, revenue growth rates of 2%-5% and a terminal growth rate of 2%, there is no impairment of the goodwill
balance or associated assets. The current year's trading result and discount rate are consistent with the value-in-use calculation prepared at 31
December 2019. However, the revenue growth rates have been reduced from 3%-13% to 2%-5% to reflect the potential impact of Covid-19 and
the economic environment in the next 1-5 years. The terminal growth rate has remained consistent, but sensitivity was performed to ensure a 1%
terminal growth rate would not result in an impairment.
No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an impairment of goodwill.


    Critical accounting estimates and judgements
    The review of impairment of intangible assets uses judgement to identify indicators of impairment. Where an impairment test is
    performed, estimates of financial performance, revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates are made.

Accrued income and other sundry receivables includes $19.64m (Jun 2019 - $18.48m) of kiwifruit income for kiwifruit harvested and delivered
to Zespri from the Group’s New Zealand orchards, $18.62m (Jun 2019 - $16.95m) for post harvest operations in New Zealand and nil (Jun 2019 -
$5.65m) relating to kiwifruit harvested, packed and delivered through the acquired Aongatete Coolstores Limited.
Accrued income and other sundry receivables also includes $4.29m (Jun 2019 - $2.40m) of income for kiwifruit and pears harvested in Australia.
Current trade receivables include $21.14m (Jun 2019 - $12.63m) related to temporary advances to kiwifruit growers during harvest. The increase
on 2019 is due to a larger proportion of SunGold versus Hayward kiwifruit packed and loaded out in 2020, with SunGold attracting a higher
advance and earlier loadout schedule. Of these temporary advances, $18.24m was repaid in July 2020 (Jul 2019 - $8.83m)
Income from the New Zealand kiwifruit crop is accrued based on forecast information prepared by the Group, being an average Hayward orchard
gate return (OGR) of $6.00 per tray (Jun 2019 - $6.00; Dec 2019 - $6.81) and an average SunGold OGR of $11.37 per tray (Jun 2019 - $10.50; Dec
2019 - $11.65).

     Critical accounting estimates and judgements
     The Group has reviewed trade and other receivables for any debtor impairment, credit risk, or any other such risks that may result in non-
     payment as a result of Covid-19. The Group has not identified any circumstances where further provisioning or impairment of financial
     instruments is required.

harvested at balance date. As at 30 June 2020, 58.6% (Jun 2019 - 58.4%) of New Zealand class 1 trays have been loaded out. New Zealand
kiwifruit inventory is valued at a Hayward OGR of $6.00 per tray and a SunGold OGR of $11.37 per tray.

At balance date, $27.30m (June 2019 - $28.43m ) of packaging inventory costs were expensed to cost of sales in the statement of financial performance.

     Critical accounting estimates and judgements

     required. The Group considers all inventory will be able to be used in the normal course of business.

The goodwill was allocated to the post harvest and orchard segments and is attributable to the operation’s strong position in the Bay of Plenty and
synergies expected to arise after adding additional post harvest and orchard facilities to Seeka’s operations. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired
in the foreseeable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of $0.20m were included in
administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $2.9m was provided in relation to differences between tax values and the fair value of certain assets.
Land and buildings were valued using an independent valuation completed by Telfer Young Valuers using the same approach as other land and
buildings detailed in note 6.
No changes have been made since 31 December 2019.

On 25 February 2020, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.12 per share, comprising an $0.08 normal dividend (following Board policy
on a pre NZ IFRS 16 basis) and a $0.04 special dividend from the completion of property sales negotiated in 2019. Dividend payment was schedule for
17 April 2020.
On 19 March 2020 the directors reviewed the environment and, with the uncertainty of Covid-19, the Group decided to cancel the payment of the
declared dividend of $0.12 per share. The decision reflected the uncertainty in the business environment, the reported shortage of labour, and the
lower forecast kiwifruit returns from Zespri. The Board, considered those factors, and considered it was prudent that the dividend be cancelled to
maintain balance sheet strength and stability, and was reconsidered in June 2020.
On 17 June 2020, the directors confirmed their earlier decision not to pay a dividend of $0.12 per share.
In the last 12 months, $0.12 has been paid in dividends per share (prior 12 months $0.24).
Dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend re-
investment plan. The cash dividend payment was $3.05m at June 2019, and $6.31m for the full year ended December 2019.
At the date of signing the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.10 per share, to be paid on 30 September 2020 to those shareholders on
the register at 5pm on 4 September 2020. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price.

15. Share capital
During the period to 30 June 2020, $0.05m (Jun 2019 - $1.13m) was received in relation to shares issued under the employee share scheme
established in 2016.
Due to the dividend cancellation as described in note 14, no shares were issued in 2020 under the dividend reinvestment plan (Dec 2019 - 168,526).
Under the grower loyalty share scheme established March 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued on 10 April 2019 at $4.76 per share.
Under the employee share scheme established March 2019, 568,000 shares were issued on 10 April 2019 at $4.76 per share.

16. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table analyses financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as at 30 June 2020.
The different levels are defined as:
– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
  Instruments in level 1 are comprised of water shares and irrigation water rights.
– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
  when determining an appropriate price.
