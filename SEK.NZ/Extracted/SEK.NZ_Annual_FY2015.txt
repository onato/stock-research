Seeka's Business Profile and Strategy
Profile and strategy

Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited (Seeka) is founded on being an integrated orcharding, post harvest, supply and retail
services company. Our strategy is to concentrate on our kiwifruit foundation while extending our business into other
produce sectors that complement our core competencies. Our vision is to be New Zealand’s Premier Produce Company
and our strategy may see Seeka extending its geographical boundaries and result in acquisitions or alliances that
profitably complement our existing capabilities. Seeka aims to deliver its shareholders returns higher than the average of
the NZX50 and improve the financial wellbeing of all our stakeholders.

New Zealand orcharding and post harvest services

Seeka’s orcharding business grows kiwifruit, avocados and kiwiberries on more than 800 hectares of orchards through
managed, leased and long-term lease arrangements with orchard and land owners. Operations extend from the East Cape
though the Bay of Plenty and Coromandel to Northland with orcharding services delivered through a networked team of
professional orchard managers and contractors who are experts in growing all varieties of kiwifruit.

Seeka’s post-harvest business harvests, packs and coolstores approximately 28m trays of kiwifruit, avocados and
kiwiberries each season. Seeka has eight packing and coolstore facilities located in the Bay of Plenty, Coromandel and
Northland. Volumes are increasing.

Using advanced inventory management systems, Seeka's coordinates fruit loadout so it is delivered to the consumer in
premium condition. Our knowledge base is underpinned by our own inhouse technical team and laboratory operation
(VLS) which provide growers and post-harvest management with optimal information on fruit maturity and quality.

Seeka’s business includes the management of Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited; grower-controlled entities
that manage and distribute Seeka-supplying grower funds through separate legal companies. Seeka Growers Limited
and AvoFresh Limited are independently audited and provide growers with clear separation of their monies from Seeka's
commercial operations.

New Zealand Retail services

Retail services, which encompasses Seeka's supply operations, covers the distribution and marketing of all non-Zespri-
supplied export kiwifruit, including collaborative marketing agreements, along with avocado and kiwiberry export
operations. Retail services also imports, ripens and distributes tropical fruits and bananas under agency for Sumifru.
Our retail services enable Seeka to deliver orchardists and international clients a full orchard-to-market service for an
expanding range of products. It attracts new grower clients, improves post-harvest asset utilisation and diversifies Seeka’s
revenue streams.

2015, owns 505 hectares of land adjacent to Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. Approximately 250 hectares is in producing
orchards. Seeka Australia grows, packs and markets all produce from the land, and is the largest producer of Australian-
grown kiwifruit and nashi pears with approximately 200 hectares in these two main crops and a further 50 hectares in

Report of the Chairman and Chief Executive


Overview
Seeka is pleased to present its audited financial results for the year ended 31 December, 2015. This year's growth in
revenue and profits is consistent with strategy. The key components of that growth include:
   • Another year of strong orchard recovery from the devastating impact of Psa-V particularly the Zespri SunGold ( G3)
     variety.
   • Strategically planned diversification of Seeka’s business in Australia and New Zealand and by applying our expertise
     to additional fresh produce lines.
   • The purchase and integration of the business of Bunbartha Fruit Packers, now Seeka Australia, in the last quarter of
     the year.

On 4 March 2015 a fire at Oakside our largest packhouse facility caused significant operational disruption two weeks
before the kiwifruit picking season commenced. Additionally the fire caused considerable downstream impact on load out
plans and fruit storage. A number of insurance claims were lodged with insurers for losses and costs arising from this fire.
Not all claims were finalised and accepted by the insurers at year end.

Net profit after tax of $4.27m is ahead of guidance released to the market of between $2.96m and $3.53m (the range in
the forecast/guidance was partly due to the uncertainty of pending insurance claims).

     Introduction
     Seeka is in a period of strong growth. Revenue of $142.11m is up 22.9% on the pcp. Seeka records its agency commission
     as revenue when we sell produce on behalf of customers. Turnover was $184.74m (up 24.3% on the pcp) when the value
     of all fruit sold is recorded as turnover.

     Profitability continues to improve. New Zealand kiwifruit volumes are increasing after the devastating effects of Psa-V.
     Seeka’s packed volumes increased to 27.8 million trays, compared to 21.4 million trays in the pcp. After-tax profit was
     $4.27m, up from $3.17m in the pcp.

     Results exceed expectation but were affected by a net $0.32m of insurance-related costs and $1.12m transactional
     and stamp duty costs associated with the acquisition of Seeka Australia. The net insurance costs included a grower
     relationship payment of $4.04m for growers to ensure they were fairly compensated for their fruit while Seeka worked
     through the insurance process. At 31 December, aspects of the insurance claim are still in progress.

     Seeka Australia was purchased on a crop-off basis, meaning we spent $4.53m by year end growing the crops for harvest
     2016.

     Earnings per share of $0.29 was up 32% on the pcp’s $0.22. The company issued 738,950 shares under the grower share
     scheme and 60,364 shares under the dividend reinvestment programme. Net asset backing of $4.34 per share was also
     up on the prior period’s $4.07. The closing share price was $3.45.

     Seeka has increased debt by $33.99m to finance infrastructure expansion in New Zealand to handle increasing kiwifruit
     volumes and to finance the purchase of Seeka Australia.

     Seeka invested $16.39m in New Zealand plant and equipment, compared to $5.64m in the pcp. New Zealand
     infrastructure will expand further in 2016 to ensure sufficient capacity to process fruit at its optimum time. Seeka has
     purchased land adjacent to the Transpac facility for long-term development and head office premises.

     Seeka invested NZD$20.16m in its Australian acquisition, with further deferred payments of AUD$5.00m due in 2016. Full
     investment details are outlined later in this report. The company has expensed transaction costs and stamp duty totalling
     $1.12m. Benefits of the acquisition are anticipated in the 2016 financial results.

     The company continues to build shareholder wealth and increase dividends. In total $0.19 in dividends were paid or
     declared per share, compared to $0.16 last year. It was nil four years ago.

Strategy
Seeka’s vision is to be New Zealand’s premier produce business, a natural development on our kiwifruit platform. Seeka
is on a growth path, both in size and profitability and is taking a long-term view. The company aims to deliver returns
superior to the NZX50 at a total shareholder return level and will:
   • Build on activities where it has competency and performance - things it is good at.
   • Strive to make value accretive investments in the perspective of our shareholders.
   • Pursue vertically integrated opportunities where it is able and deliver higher returns to stakeholders.
   • Strive to be a company that is safe and people focused.

Seeka may contemplate acquisitions where they meet the criteria of the Board. The company aspires to grow its market
capitalisation to $200m, compared to $61m today and $18m when the strategy was initiated.




                                                                                                                          5

          Review of post harvest and supply operations
          Seeka’s post-harvest and supply operations comprise the planning and operation of harvest, packing, coolstore, logistics
          and supply operations for kiwifruit, avocados and kiwiberry. Operations have two functional general managers covering
          planning and supply and post-harvest operations.

          The industry share of Hayward held constant at 24%, while Gold increased from 10% to 14% and is anticipated to
          increase again in 2016.

          Seeka packed 27.8 million trays of kiwifruit, up from 21.4 million trays in the pcp. Growth in Zespri SunGold volumes
          continues to surge with 3.88 million trays packed in 2015, up from 1.2 million trays in the pcp. Seeka packed 351,000 trays
          of avocados and 39,000 trays of kiwiberry.

Operations were put under extreme pressure by the Oakside facility fire immediately prior to harvest. The team had to
focus on site remediation with the support of contractors. Harvest went smoothly but by the end of packing it became
apparent that Hayward fruit processed at Oakside was softer and was softening quicker than fruit processed at other
facilities. Gold fruit was unaffected.

Seeka notified insurers of a potential claim for extraordinary fruit loss as a consequence of the fire. Adjusters, appointed
by the insurer, Zespri and Seeka, put in place a mitigation plan to minimise loss. This plan saw Seeka priority-load the fruit
from Oakside. While Seeka largely mitigated the losses associated with the Oakside-processed fruit, it did incur losses
in delaying fruit shipped from other sites. The insurance claim for Oakside-processed fruit has been accepted by the
insurers, and the claim for the mitigation losses is still being assessed.

In order to protect Seeka's growers from the potential impact on income and cash flow, Seeka paid them $4.04m ahead of
any insurance outcome. The $4.04m has been expensed in 2015 and recovery from insurance, if any, will be recorded as
income in 2016.

Excluding the $4.04m grower payment, EBITDA from post-harvest would have been $17.33m, including the grower
payment EBITDA is $13.29m. This compares to $10.77m in the pcp.

Companies define their relationship with their customers and stakeholders by how they behave and respond when things
go wrong. Seeka reacted positively for its growers and stakeholders and stood behind them. As at 31 December, Seeka's
Hayward growers were forecast to receive $4.95 in orchard gate returns per tray, which is slightly above the industry
forecast average of $4.87 per tray. The Gold crop was not involved in the insurance issue.

The fire and mitigation strategy were extraordinary events that placed significant pressure on staff, growers and suppliers.
The company has worked through the issues and is positioned positively for 2016. The insurance process remains open
and active.

Seeka continues to revise its team structure as production levels increase, with more than fifteen roles created in its post-
harvest and supply teams to ensure the company has the right people, trained in the right roles with clear accountabilities
ahead of the next season.

Capital investment of approximately $13.37m is underway on coolstore capacity expansion at KKP, Maketu and Main
Road in Katikati. In the process, Seeka is maximising land ownership at strategic packhouse sites and balancing the
coolstore infrastructure with anticipated packing volumes.

There are significant other capital investments underway, including an additional 9,000 plastic Seeka S600 bins. These
bins are superior to wooden bins; they protect fruit, provide a lower damage profile from orchard to the packing machine,
and provide operational efficiencies to picking contractors.

The combination of people, infrastructure expansion and new bins has set up our packhouse sites well to manage the
expected crop volumes next season.

                     Review of orchard division performance
                     Orchard operations handle all growing and orchard management services for the company’s orchards (managed, owned
                     and leased). Operations cover the growing of kiwifruit, avocados and kiwiberry across Seeka’s catchment from Northland
                     to the East Cape.

                     EBITDA from orchard operations of $3.98m compares to $4.18m in the pcp. In total 9.2m trays of kiwifruit were grown by
                     orchard division compared to 7.2m trays in the pcp.

                     While market returns remain firm, they have reduced from the highs of the previous year. This and increasing on-orchard
                     costs have suppressed the division’s earnings. Seeka continues to invest in leased Gold orchards and long-term lease
                     orchards are still returning to full production. Yields and production are expected to lift when orchards achieve full
                     maturity.

                     Forecast Hayward orchard gate returns averaged $4.95 per tray, compared to $5.96 in the pcp and a forecast Zespri
                     industry average of $4.87; SunGold was $8.22 per tray, compared to $10.40 in the pcp and a forecast Zespri industry
                     average of $8.14.

                     Overall yields from the division were excellent. Hayward yields across the 8.0 million trays grown were an astonishing
                     11,626 trays per hectare compared to a record industry average of 11,044 trays per hectare. Gold orchards [G3] averaged
                     8,858 per hectare, less than two-thirds of their final targeted production.

                     Seeka is investing in the next generation of orchard managers, recruiting six cadets as trainee orchard managers. These
                     cadets are part of a structured training programme that will see them achieve a tertiary qualification and a career pathway
                     in horticulture.

Retail services
Seeka’s retail services handle all non-Zespri kiwifruit sales from New Zealand, kiwifruit sales under collaborative
marketing, avocado sales and Seeka's kiwiberry sales. It also handles the integrated supply line for imported fruit and fruit
supplied to the New Zealand domestic market including the agency for Sumifru and the importation of their bananas. This
business includes ripening and retail service operations in Auckland and Christchurch, and an Auckland wholesale market.

EBITDA of $1.73m compares to $1.77m in the pcp. The banana ripening and distribution business was behind expectation
at the end of the first six months due to global supply issues. The volumes returned to normal during the second six
months, with earnings returning to expectation.

The business established important new domestic supply programmes in 2015 to the benefit of our supplying growers.
Direct-to-retail programmes were initiated for Hayward and Gold kiwifruit, in addition to a new programme for avocados.
These are the first direct-to-retail programmes undertaken by Seeka in the domestic market. They performed well
delivering an incremental return to growers and excellent quality to customers.

      Seeka Australia
      In August 2015, Seeka announced the purchase of the business and assets of Bunbartha Fruit Packers and established
      Seeka Australia Pty Limited. The AUD$22m purchase included an unconditional deferred settlement of AUD$5m to
      occur in 2016. The purchase was completed on a crop-off basis with Seeka to grow the 2016 crop. Seeka had invested
      NZD$4.53m growing that crop at balance date. The purchase price was completed with 100% debt financing.

      The purchase includes approximately 505 hectares of land at Shepparton, of which approximately 250 hectares is in
      productive orchards. The primary crops include approximately 100 hectares of kiwifruit and a hundred hectares of nashi
      pears, with the remaining in apricots, European pears, plums and cherries.

      The company purchased 1,534 water shares on acquisition and during the year invested a further $0.51m to ensure
      sufficient water for the current year along with some buffer for future orchard expansion.

      Seeka has integrated the operational side of the business establishing management, financial, safety and human resources
      systems into the company. The people who transferred to Seeka Australia on purchase are experienced orcharding
      professionals. Seeka will move to integrate the sales process through the first half of 2016.

      There is scope for significant expansion and improvements in the operations. Seeka anticipates EBITDA of between
      NZD$3.2m and $4.0m in the first harvest year. It is a significant step for the company consistent with the stated strategy
      for Seeka.

      Safety and Compliance
      The safety of our people and suppliers remains a primary focus for Seeka. People who work at Seeka, or who visit our
      sites and orchards must do so in a safe environment and manner. We continue to challenge the behaviours of our people
      and suppliers. Seeka has established a compliance team to work with our network of contractors to reinforce safety as
      a feature of normal work practice and to ensure they comply with employment legislation. As a result our company has
      delivered a good safety profile as illustrated by a lost time frequency rate of 0.90 lost hours per 100,000 hours worked.

      Seeka had two notifiable serious harm injuries in 2015, both preventable. While at the lower end of serious harm, the
      incidents themselves were disappointing. Further enhancements were made to our safety policies as a result of these
      incidents. Seeka tracks all near miss accidents and regularly audits and reviews operations for safety compliance and
      safety targets are included in key performance indicators across the business.

      People
      Seeka continues to refine its structure, and support and develop our people. The company has intensively recruited in the
      last six months of the year to rebuild competency necessarily removed through the downturn of Psa-V.

      Importantly the Company has recruited cadets.

      During the year, Murray Judd left the company seeking a lifestyle change. Murray has been with Seeka for more than 10
      years, providing thoughtful insight, research, suggestions and technical advice that have delivered improved financial
      outcomes for the company and its growers. While Murray has retired, he is consulting and remains contracted to Seeka.
      Thank you, Murray.

      It is people that make a good company great. We thank senior management for their leadership, all employees for their
      hard work and commitment to the company, and its stakeholders throughout a very challenging and busy year.




      Grower share scheme
      This is the second year of the three-year grower share scheme introduced in 2014 to respond to fierce competition in
      the kiwifruit post harvest business for fruit supply following the outbreak of Psa-V. The scheme offered facilitated share
      ownership to growers who committed their entire orchard crop for the three years of the scheme.

      This year 738,950 shares ( 2014: 605,152) were allocated to qualifying growers at a cost of $3.37 each (2014: $3.05) and
      a total cost of $2.49m (2014: $1.85m).

Outlook
Seeka has significantly increased its profit and size during the year. The immediate outlook for growth remains positive as
Seeka concentrates on expanding New Zealand facilities to handle higher kiwifruit volumes, completes the integration of
Seeka Australia and improves orchard productivity in Australia. The company holds to its strategy and vision, and remains
watchful and ready to make further steps to realise any opportunities aligned to strategy should they arise.

Directors and management thank contractors and suppliers for their service and support. We thank our supplying
growers for their continuing loyalty. We compliment shareholders for their support and the interest that they show in their
company.

     Accounting policies
     Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.
     Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
     reporting date, and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
     Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax loses of assets and
     liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
     recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit.
     Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably will not
     reverse in the foreseeable future.
     Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the
     laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
     A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
     differences can be utilised.

buildings; actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.

Impairment
On 4 March 2015, the Group's Oakside facility suffered a fire which led to the destruction or damage to an ancillary packhouse and
office, and a number of coolstore buildings and associated plant, all of which were part of post harvest operations.
As a result the Group has a $1.74m impairment loss that has been recognised within the statement of financial performance.
The Group is fully insured for loss on assets and also business interruption. At balance date the value of insurance recoveries is estimated
to be $5.46m of which $2.48m had been received for the asset loss.

The amortisation period of software is four to five years and the remaining amortisation period for the interest in leased land is from 35 to
93 years.
The Group's interest in leased land occupied, or held for future development, arose on the acquisition of Huka Pak and is the difference in
the value of the lease terms to relative market terms.
Permanent water shares is an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual crops in
Australia. The fair value of permanent water shares used for impairment testing is supported by the traded price of the shares.


Impairment tests for goodwill
The Board reviews business performance based on operating segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level in
accordance with the below policy. Goodwill represents the Group's retail services acquired with Glassfields and the acquisition of Seeka
Australia (Pty) Limited.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the 5 year after-tax cash flow projection, with a terminal value beyond
5 years. Cash flows beyond the 5 year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated below. The
assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit, is determined based on
past performance and Directors' expectations of future market development. No impairment arose in the current year.
No impairment would be required if the discount rate applied was 1% higher or if the terminal growth rate was 1% lower.

The following table details the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations and the recoverable amount in 2015.

     Accounting policies
     Biological assets are the crops hanging on the vines and trees in the Group's leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair
     value depends on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
     When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (so long as
     the costs are considered recoverable).
     When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.

Within current trade receivables, $1.35m are past due (Dec 2014 - $1.19m), of which 4% are more than 90 days (Dec 2014 - 4%).
Non-current trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment
terms of up to five years.


Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due but not considered impaired. Debts which
are known to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.

For specific vendors, packaging goods purchased but not paid for are covered by a security interest. At balance date, this was nil (Dec
2014 - $0.01m).
At balance date, $20.95m (Dec 2014 - $18.84m) of packaging inventory costs were expensed to cost of sales in the statement of financial
performance.


Accounting policies
Raw materials and stores, work in progress, finished goods and fruit produce are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
comprises direct materials and direct labour, and are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sales costs.

     Accounting policies
     Allocation rights are carried at fair value supported by the value of the traded rights on a recognised exchange or market at measurement
     date.
     Water allocation rights are recognised as a current asset when they are allocated to water shares each year, and are subsequently
     expensed when the water attached to them is used.

     No other leases were identified as onerous.


     Accounting policies
     A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated
     reliably and the Group expects to settle the obligation.

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect
the term portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates. See Note 31.




Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised
cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan
transaction cost. When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and
amortised over the period of the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after balance date.

     Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the
     number of fully paid shares held.




     Grower Incentive Scheme
     On 7 September 2015, the Group issued 738,950 shares at a price of $3.37 each in respect of the 2015 kiwifruit supply season to
     participating growers. See note 3.




     Accounting policies
     Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
     Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
     attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares
     are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
     incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (excluding any costs of servicing
equity other than ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus
elements in ordinary shares issued during the period.

Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income
tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of
shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

The land and buildings revaluation reserve is used to record increments and decrements on the revaluation of land and buildings.
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record foreign currency translation differences on the translation of the Group entities
results and financial position. The amounts are accumulated in other comprehensive income and recognised in profit and loss when the
foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
The foreign currency revaluation reserve is used to record unrealised gains and losses on the Group's assets and liabilities held in foreign
currencies.


Share based payment reserve
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based compensation plans: a new employees share scheme that was established in 2014,
and a scheme established in 2002 that is not active and is in the process of being terminated and the surplus shares will be sold.
The active scheme is managed by a trust established in October 2014, and the directors of the trustee company (Seeka Employee Share
Plan Trustee Limited) are also Directors of Seeka.
For both employee share schemes shares are issued to an employee share trust, with certain employees eligible to subscribe to shares
held by the trust with this benefit recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At
the end of the vesting period the employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to
them, alternatively the employee can elect not to have the shares transferred to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven.

     At balance date, the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted to employees and remain outstanding under the
     schemes was 423,300 (Dec 2014 - 429,600), representing 2.59% (Dec 2014 - 2.77%) of the shares of the Company on issue at that date.
     The shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust.
     The options element of the scheme is valued using a Black Scholes pricing model. Because the Company has a small market capitalisation
     with minimal trading, the Board forecasts expected volatility.

     The following table details inputs to the Black Scholes pricing model.

     reasonably represents current fair value. The carrying amount of all unlisted securities have been reviewed at balance date with no
     impairments arising.

     Services, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia.
     The goodwill of $6.27m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired business, synergies to be achieved and increased
     earnings.
     By acquiring all shares not yet owned by the Group, Seeka established a wholly-owned Australian-based subsidiary to acquire the
     business and handle debt financing. The purchase price was funded through debt facilities with AUD$17.0m paid on completion and two
     further deferred payments of AUD$2.5m to be paid 15 January 2016 and 1 July 2016 respectively.
     Acquisition-related costs of NZD$616,000 and NZD$504,000 stamp duty costs were expensed in the consolidated income statement.

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the
voting rights in the entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost.
The Group's share of associates' profits or losses are recognised in the statement of financial performance and the carrying amount of the
investment in the statement of financial position.
Dividends received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.




                                                                                                                                                      43

     Accounting policies
     Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
     Operating leases include short term orchard leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the
     lessor) are charged to the Statement of Financial Performance on a straight line basis over the period of the lease, except for short term
     orchard leases where lease costs are recognised at the same time as other crop related income and expenses.

     Note 30. Determination of fair values
     Fair value of financial assets
     The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
     The different levels are defined as:
     Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
     Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited.
     Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability , either directly or indirectly.
     Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would
     use when determining an appropriate price.
     		 Level 1                                                                                                 Level 2                 Level 3          Total

     Auditors’ Report




      Independent Auditors’ Report
      to the shareholders of Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited



      Report on the Financial Statements
      We have audited the financial statements of Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited (“the Company”)
      on pages 14 to 55, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015, the
      statement of financial performance, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes
      in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial
      statements that include significant accounting policies and other explanatory information for the
      Group. The Group comprises the Company and the entities it controlled at 31 December 2015 or from
      time to time during the financial year.

      Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Statements

      The Directors are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of
      these financial statements in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
      Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal controls
      as the Directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
      from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

      Auditors’ Responsibility

      Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
      conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). These
      standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform the
      audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
      misstatement.

      An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
      in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including
      the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
      fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider the internal controls relevant
      to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design
      audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
      opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
      appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates, as well as
      evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

      We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
      our audit opinion.

      We are independent of the Group. Our firm provides tax related and other assurance services for the
      Group. The provision of these other services has not impaired our independence.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements on pages 14 to 55 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and its financial performance and cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial
Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.

Restriction on Use of our Report

This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body, in accordance with the
Companies Act 1993. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state those matters which
we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have
formed.

     SUMMARY OF WAIVERS GRANTED BY NZX
     On 1 September 2014, NZX granted Seeka a waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 7.11.1 in relation to its grower incentive
     scheme in respect of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 kiwifruit supply seasons.
     Listing Rule 7.11.1 requires an issuer to issue shares within 5 business days after the latest date on which applications for those shares
     close. Under Seeka’s grower incentive scheme, a grower is required to return an entitlement and acceptance form prior to 31 March
     in the relevant supply season in order to participate in the scheme. However, a participating grower would not be issued shares under
     the scheme until 7 September of the relevant supply season and any future supply season(s), which is later than the 5 business day
     period required by Listing Rule 7.11.1.
     Accordingly, NZX has granted Seeka a waiver from the requirements of Listing Rule 7.11.1 for the purposes of its grower incentive
     scheme. A condition of the waiver is that Seeka must issue shares within 5 business days of 31 August in each of the relevant supply
     seasons.
