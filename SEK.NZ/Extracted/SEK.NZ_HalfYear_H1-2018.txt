    FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
    Seeka’s Board is pleased to provide you with this report on our financial and operational results for the six months ended 30 June 2018.
    A number of strategic highlights were achieved during the last six months. This report profiles these highlights, comments on the
    performance of the company and updates the full year financial guidance.

    The seasonal nature of Seeka’s foundation business of growing, packing, storing, shipping and selling fresh produce means the
    company is more profitable in the first six months of each financial year. The financial performance for the half year does not reflect the
    company’s forecast full year performance. Full year EBITDA earnings are forecast to increase between 4% and 8% on 2017’s $23.13m,
    and NPAT between 12% and 24% on the previous full year’s result of $5.83m. Any material deviation to this guidance will be advised to
    shareholders and investors through the NZX.


    Results for the six months ended 30 June 2018 include
       • Profit after tax of $10.37m (2017: $11.09m); a decrease of 6.5%.

       • EBITDA of $23.47m (2017: $21.93m); an increase of 7%.

       • Further impairment and accelerated amortisation of the goodwill and supplier contract in the tropical business, Seeka Glassfields,
         of $1.5m.

       • Increased New Zealand kiwifruit crop volumes with 31.1m tray equivalents handled (2017: 25.6m); up 21%.

       • Improvement in earnings for Seeka’s emerging business, the Delicious Nutritious Food Company. Earnings at an EBITDA level of
         $0.40m compared to $0.16m for the first six months in 2017.

       • Record returns in the 2017/18 avocado selling season. Seeka successfully distributed and marketed 209,850 trays of avocados
         delivering an exceptional average return to growers of $40.81 (2016/17: $24.85).

       • Successful and safe harvest seasons for all crops across New Zealand and Australia including kiwifruit, avocados, nashi and pears.

       • Successful completion of the first year of maturity testing services for Zespri at Seeka’s laboratory testing business VLS.

       • Successful acquisition and integration of the Northland post harvest business and related kiwifruit orchards from Turners and
         Growers Horticulture Limited (T&G Horticulture). The post harvest business was integrated into Seeka mid harvest without issue.

       • Continuing investment in Seeka Australia’s orchard development which will significantly increase production in coming years.

       • The New Zealand High Court decided in favour of growers in their claim against the Crown for losses related to New Zealand's Psa
         outbreak. This includes Seeka as a grower. Seeka was unsuccessful in its claims related to losses as a post harvest operator. The
         decision was appealed by the Crown and subsequently cross-appealed by the plaintiffs including Seeka's claim as a post harvest
         operator.

1. 2017 reported EBITDA was increased by a non-recurring benefit of $0.1m ($0.07m after tax) relating to the early termination of a long-term orchard lease agreement.

2. 2018 reported EBIT was reduced by $1.5m ($1.5m after tax) as a consequence of the impairment and accelerated amortisation of intangible assets (see note 6).



Dividend announcement
A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 21 September 2018 to
those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 14 September 2018. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply to the distribution.


Outlook
Seeka is anticipating improved operational earnings for the remainder of 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the rebound in volumes of
New Zealand kiwifruit production and stronger avocado volumes and earnings. The following guidance is based on Seeka's best estimate
on the forward six months earnings. The market will be updated if there is material deviation.


                                                                                                   2017               2018 guidance                  2018 guidance

1. NPAT is based on normal tax rates applying in New Zealand and Australia.

2. The increase of 12%-24% in net profit after tax against 2017 is due to a number of non-recurring negative adjustments that occurred in 2017.
   This included a $2m impairment of goodwill and a $1m deferred tax adjustment.




                                                                                                                                                                           3
    Review of operations
    Revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2018 totalled $145.44m (2017: $134.01m).

    Consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) totalled $23.47m (2017: $21.93m); up 7%. Included
    in the consolidated result was $2.70m EBITDA from Seeka Australia (2017: $3.41m); down by 21% from a dry summer growing period.

    Profits for the six months were impacted by a $1.53m write down of goodwill in the tropical business, Seeka Glassfields.

    Consolidated profit after tax for the six months was $10.37m (2017: $11.09m); down 6.5%.

    Cash flow from operations totalled $1.55m (2017: $4.73m); reflecting additional interest paid on debt and timing of tax paid.

    Seeka invested a total of $26.10m, which was partly offset by $6.33m of asset disposals. The investment includes payments for
    Northland assets some of which are now being marketed for sale via tender, including 15.5 hectares of Zespri SunGold in production and
    18.6 hectares in development. As at 30 June, Seeka had paid $8.32m for the post harvest facility and $8.99m for the orchards with clear
    title. The remaining $22.63m purchase price will be paid when titles to the remaining orchards become available.

    At 30 June, Seeka has advanced its grower pools $12.9m (2017: $11.1m) to assist with cash flow. This advance was fully repaid by 20 July.

    Seeka has continued to review and refine its coolstore and packing capacity plans. The signalled replacement of the Seeka KKP packing
    machine was deferred in favour of an upgrade to machine number 2 at Seeka Oakside. Additional pre-cooling and coolstores will be
    built to balance capacity. The newly acquired post harvest facility in Kerikeri is also scheduled for an upgrade with a new packhouse and
    increased packing, precooling and coolstore capacity.

    These two projects are planned to balance Seeka’s capacity with forecast demand for the next 36 months.

    Net debt at 30 June (bank loans less bank deposits) totalled $115.98m (2017: $94.55m); an increase of $21.43m noting both the
    investment in the Northland assets and the advance to Seeka Growers Limited.

    New Zealand operations
    Orcharding
    Orchard operations span from Northland through to the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast.

    Kiwifruit volumes grown by Seeka increased in 2018 following 2017's industry-wide drop in Hayward yields. In 2018, Seeka orchard
    operations grew 37.44m kilograms of fruit (10.4m trays) compared to the prior year's 30.70m kilograms (8.45m trays).

    Seeka also grew 200,000 kilograms of avocados and 15,000 kilograms of kiwiberry compared to 540,000 kilograms of avocados and
    40,000 kilograms of kiwiberry in the prior year.

    Total revenue for orchard operations for the six months of $38.98m compares against $36.83m in the prior year. EBITDA of $4.29m
    compares with $5.82m reflecting a reduced proportion of long term leases in Seeka’s orcharding operations. Seeka is now investing in
    long term lease arrangements with volumes set to increase over the next three years.


    Post harvest
    In 2018, 31.1m trays of kiwifruit were packed (2017: 25.6m); an increase of 5.5m trays reflecting a rebound in Hayward yields and an
    increasing number of SunGold orchards coming into production.

    The company delivered growers a safe and timely harvest and importantly had sufficient packing and coolstore capacity to handle all fruit
    at its optimum. Additional technology was deployed with near-infrared (NIR) installed at Huka Pak, primarily to assist SunGold growers
    to achieve yield from lines of fruit that struggle to achieve Zespri’s stringent dry matter thresholds.

    On 30 April, Seeka purchased and took over the Kerikeri post harvest business of T&G Horticulture. The business was integrated mid
    harvest bringing a new facility to Seeka's network and new crops. Seeka is contracted to pack citrus and blueberries for T&G Horticulture.

    Post harvest revenue of $88.58m is an increase of $14.21m on the prior period of $74.37m; up 19.1%. At 30 June, Seeka’s coolstores were
    close to full. The higher stock level from 2017 added to the improved earnings outlook. EBITDA of $21.48m compares with $17.07m in the
    prior year.


    Retail services
    EBITDA of $0.91m compares against $1.32m in the prior period reflecting a continuing slowdown in the tropical business, Seeka
    Glassfields, and lower avocado volumes in the 2017/18 selling season. Avocado volumes for 2018/19 are forecast to be strong due to
    higher yields and additional supply.

       avocado is the audited total payment to growers.
Seeka impaired the goodwill associated with the tropical business with a write down of $0.95m and accelerated the amortisation on the
related supplier contract by $0.55m. The business has suffered with the decision of Seeka’s major customer to supply their own bananas
and centralise ripening alongside their new supply chain and distribution centre strategy. Goodwill of $0.44m remains on the balance
sheet for Glassfields.

The Delicious Nutritious Food Company is delivering strong growth. Earnings for the six months delivered EBITDA of $0.40m compared
to $0.16m in the previous corresponding period.

The Delicious Nutritious Food Company produces three innovative products with a new manufacturing and processing facility
commissioned at Seeka’s KiwiCoast facility in Te Puke:

   • Kiwi Crush - the Kiwi Crush range turns non-export-grade kiwifruit into a high quality and high value functional food sold to
     hospitals and the retail market.

   • Avocado oil – the manufacture, processing, bottling and distribution of avocado oil products destined for premium export markets.

   • Kiwiberry – the specialist packing, storage and distribution of kiwiberry, with a new punnet line to increase packing capacity for this
     high-value product.

The kiwiberry component was added to the business during the past six months with an investment made in a high capacity kiwiberry
packing line. This machine delivered a step change in sophistication and volume, giving kiwiberry growers a more timely harvest and
better delivery of high quality produce to the market.

The Delicious Nutritious Food Company is poised for further growth.


Australia operations
Seeka Australia PTY Limited
Kiwifruit harvest yields were lower in 2018 due to a very hot and dry summer, which impacted on fruit size and growth. Seeka has 67
hectares in development for production in 2020 which will significantly lift volumes.

Across all varieties Seeka is concentrating on quality as well as increasing yields. The following table shows historical volumes by variety.

With high sunlight hours, Australian kiwifruit have excellent quality and taste. Seeka has concentrated on upgrading the post harvest
infrastructure and developing new orchards. A new plant nursery was built which produced plants for both existing and new orchards.
Seeka is planning to develop one of its new kiwifruit orchards as organic to fulfil market demand for organic produce.

In the pear orchards Seeka is concentrating on introducing new hybrid varieties. These exciting, sweeter pears deliver a better taste
experience to consumers, along with higher yields and lower per unit production costs. Increasingly Australian consumers are moving
away from commodity pears to high quality hybrid pears.

EBITDA of $2.70m (2017: $3.41m) was a positive result considering the difficult growing season.

Seeka's Australian operations are an important investment in diversity and we will continue to further develop the business, including
new orchards and improvements to existing orchards. Yields will improve over the next three years as new plantings mature.

Seeka continues to closely monitor and invest in water to ensure it has sufficient to grow existing and future crops.




                                                                                                                                                7
    Strategic highlights
    Seeka continues to enact its defined strategy. Kiwifruit is our core product, with the company diversifying geographically and targeting
    other produce varieties. The key focus is on growth that delivers accretive value to our stakeholders, including shareholders, growers,
    employees, contractors and community.

    Seeka has excelled where it operates the entire value chain from the orchard to the customer and delivered incremental returns to
    growers as demonstrated by avocados and kiwiberries. Kiwifruit, avocados, nashi and European pears are the major varieties in which
    Seeka delivers orchard to market excellence.

    During the six months Seeka purchased the post harvest assets and related kiwifruit orchards from T&G Horticulture. Subsequent to
    the purchase Seeka secured SunGold licences for a portion of these orchards and placed the orchards for sale with a conditional long-
    term supply commitment to Seeka. The acquisition provides Seeka with kiwifruit and avocado packing capacity and volumes, as well as
    providing services for citrus and berries.

    Alongside the T&G Horticulture transaction, Seeka’s largest offshore shareholder sold a parcel of shares to New Zealanders. This off-
    market transaction lowered Seeka’s foreign ownership below 25% and outside the regime of the Overseas Investment Office.

    The company has focussed on asset utilisation while deliberately balancing on shore coolstore and packing capacity to ensure great
    service and results to supplying growers. Plant utilisation was improved by handling new varieties including Northland avocados and
    citrus.

    Market conditions for Australian grown produce are good and the fruit produced is of excellent quality, noting it is a completely different
    growing environment. Production in Australia is set to double in the next five years.

    Seeka has actively increased its market share in avocados primarily through direct purchase and syndication of orchards in the Far North
    of New Zealand. This strategy delivered a benefit to investors as well as bringing new volume and market share to Seeka.

    Seeka continues to focus on talent development with 12 cadets in the business, with some now emerging as qualified orchard managers.
    Seeka has continued to actively source New Zealand workers to fulfil peak seasonal labour demand. The company has an RSE programme
    to complement the local workforce and supports those workers with focussed pastoral care.


    Health and safety
    Seeka’s focus is on continuous improvement and ensuring the health and safety of all personnel at all locations. Our total recordable injury
    frequency (TRIFR) remains below Seeka's target threshold. Seeka has recorded no notifiable injuries or incidents in the six months; a good
    result at the end of the main packing season.

    All incidents and near miss incidents are reported and followed up within the company.

    A number of initiatives were launched by the health and safety team, including a focus on the six major safety issues in the business.
    Moreover, the Board has commissioned a strategic review of safety risks and remedial strategies.

    The company continues to refine its health and safety strategy and systems to ensure it complies with legislation and keeps its people,
    contractors and stakeholders safe.

    The following table shows key safety measures to 30 June against annual thresholds.

    1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of
       hours worked. TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).

    2. The severity rate measures the average number of days it takes a person to get back to work after a lost time injury.
       Severity rate = (number of days lost) / (number of lost time injuries).

VLS
The Seeka-owned laboratory business VLS successfully won a contract to supply the kiwifruit industry with maturity analytical services.
The laboratory was upgraded along with its systems, staffing and resources. VLS is an ISO17025 accredited laboratory and tested 6,067
samples to produce a modest profit to the company in the first year of a three-year contract. This new service to the kiwifruit industry
was a significant event for Seeka, one requiring extraordinary effort and dedication from the team involved.


The Seeka team
Seeka's people have excelled during the six months to 30 June 2018.

Seeka has continued to invest in its people to make it the employer of choice in a tight labour market. Active development programmes
are underway across the company including a cadet programme that has been operating for four years. Trained cadets exit the
programme with external qualifications to pursue a pathway in the company on the orchards or in post harvest. Wellness programmes
are being implemented across the company with 100 employees currently signed into the quarterly programme.

Sourcing seasonal labour continues to challenge the industry. Increasingly the industry is reliant on overseas seasonal labour to
complement the local available workforce, with the supply of local workers fully utilised at key times of the season. Seeka recruits some
460 overseas workers through the RSE scheme from a total seasonal workforce of more than 3,000. Backpackers that are traditionally
employed were in short supply in 2018, adding to employment pressure. This pushed harvest and post harvest operations to the limit. In
these circumstances, the safety profile changes. Seeka continues to work on initiatives to make Seeka the employer of choice.

The company has gone to significant lengths to ensure contractors and subcontractors comply with labour, health and safety legislation,
and strive to achieve best practice. Seeka has a dedicated team to work with our contractor and subcontractor community to coach,
audit, and undertake gap analysis to ensure we achieve better than compliant.


Summary
A rebound in New Zealand kiwifruit harvest volumes and strong continuing earnings in avocados have led to an improved half year result.
Earnings in Australia are lower, reflecting a drier summer and the orchard investments yet to start producing. Earnings in Seeka’s tropical
business remain lacklustre.

Great progress was made with strategic initiatives with the acquisition and integration of the Northland assets of T&G Horticulture, and
Seeka is midway through repositioning some of these assets.

     Turnover
     The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group’s operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and services
     provided to external customers during the period. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers where
     the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

     Land and buildings
     Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus any
     subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers,
     ANZIV, independent registered valuer. In Australia valuations are undertaken by Goulburn Valley Property Services, independent valuers,
     Shepparton, Victoria, Australia.
     As at 30 June 2018 the directors believe there are no indicators of impairment that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings
     materially differs from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue those assets at balance date.

Following a major customer moving to their own direct supply of bananas in 2018, the Board reassessed the useful life remaining on the intangible
asset associated with the contract. The useful life was changed from 6 years to 4 years and the supplier contract intangible asset is now fully
amortised. Further, the Board reviewed the latest forecasts and further impaired the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Glassfields'
banana business by $0.95m. The remaining goodwill recognised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet is $0.44m. In December 2017 the
Board impaired $2.03m of goodwill in relation to these operations.
The kiwifruit licences are SunGold licences purchased from Zespri Limited on 1st May 2018. The licences give us the right to plant the gold
variety of kiwifruit. The licences were purchased with the intention of using them on orchards that are still to be settled with Turners and Growers
Horticulture Limited (T&G Horticulture). The orchards are currently sitting in note 16, capital commitments.

Note 7. Biological assets - crop
Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, packham pears, corella pears, other pears, cherries, avocado, apricot, and plum crops growing on leased and
owned orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.
The following table reconciles beginning balances to end balances for biological assets crop measured at fair value defined as level 3 in note 14.

     Effective 1 January 2018, the new accounting standard NZ IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', has been adopted in the Group's financial statements. The
     standard requires a default rate analysis in calculating the provision for doubtful debts. Based on the assessment performed by the Group, the
     revised standard does not have a material effect on the recognition of financial instruments.
     Accrued fruit and other sundry receivables includes $29.35m (Jun 2017 - $24.60m) of kiwifruit income for kiwifruit harvested and delivered to
     Zespri from the Group’s New Zealand orchards and $13.22m (Jun 2017 - $12.38m) for post harvest operations in New Zealand.
     Income from the New Zealand kiwifruit crop is accrued based on forecast information prepared by the Group, being an average Green Hayward
     orchard gate return (OGR) of $5.49 per tray (Jun 2017 - $6.06) and an average SunGold G3 OGR of $10.06 per tray (Jun 2017 - $9.21).

The goodwill is allocated to the post harvest segment and the goodwill is attributable to the post harvest operation's strong position and
profitability in trading in the Northland market and synergies expected to arise after adding an additional packhouse to the Group's operations.
The goodwill is not expected to be impaired in the foreseable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs of $0.29m are included in administrative expenses.
The fair value of the acquired land and buildings and orchards are provisional pending final valuations of those assets. Deffered tax of $0.39m has
been provided in relation to the adjustments.
The Group purchased the orchards with the intention to market the Northland land holding as it focussed on refurbishing the post harvest facility.
The Group is currently in the process of selling the orchards, which is set to run for five weeks with the current timetable calling for bids on 15
August 2018. The Group also purchased a SunGold kiwifruit licence from Zespri for $1.752m for one of the orchards classified as property held
for sale. The property held for sale recognised on the statement of financial position of $10.738m is comprised of the $8.986m detailed above in
orchards and the $1.752m of SunGold licence. This represents the fair value of the total property held for sale.

     Note 14. Determination of fair values
     Fair value of financial assets
     The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value as at 30 June 2018.
     The different levels are defined as:
      • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
        Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited and water shares.
      • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
      • Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
        when determining an appropriate price.
