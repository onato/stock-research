                   Chair and Chief Executive's report

                   We are pleased to report on a much-improved six month result, with a significant
                   increase in kiwifruit yield and volumes in both New Zealand and Australia, and a
                   focus on cost-out and operational efficiency delivering a very pleasing return to profit
                   before tax of $45.0m.


                   Much improved weather and growing conditions in all key kiwifruit regions benefitted
                   growers in New Zealand and Australia. Kiwifruit yields rebounded after low yields
                   in 2023. Seeka's New Zealand volumes in 2024 were up 44% to 43.0m class 1 trays
                   (2023 - 29.8m trays), and Australia up 164% to 2.3m kilograms (2023 - 0.9 kgs).


                   The following table outlines Seeka’s financial performance for six months ending 30
                   June 2024 (1H24).

                                                                                                               Main contents




      Seeka’s revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (1H24) totalled $284.2m (1H23: $212.7m),
      an increase of 34%.
      Following on from the poor 2023 harvest, our focus has been on delivering operational excellence
      and providing outstanding service with resolute attention to cost control and earnings to improve
      profitability and reduce debt when grower advances are repaid. Previous investments in automation
      performed well delivering efficiencies, packing capacity and financial return.
      Seeka restructured in 2023 to create a leaner organisation and implemented innovative cost saving
      mechanisms. This includes a captive insurance structure with the business moving 100% of its
      material damage and business interruption policies directly into the international insurance market.
      This has lowered insurance premiums and avoided inflationary increases.
      Prudent financial management together with a fruit volume increase resulted in a satisfying
      improvement in financial performance, with profit before tax up 230% to $45.0m (1H23: $13.6m).
      Profit after tax of $17.1m compares very favourably against $10.5m in the prior year, also noting the
      one-off impact of the removal of the tax deductibility of building depreciation creating a non-cash
      adjustment to the deferred tax liability of $13.9m.
      The Company has focused on prudent debt management including improving utilisation of existing
      facilities and holding capital investment to maintenance levels. Additionally, an extensive review
      was undertaken to identify material damage risk to all key assets which is driving a programme of
      investment and renewal of core infrastructure to mitigate these risks. Seeka continues to review the
      asset mix and consider opportunities to sell and lease back facilities in appropriate circumstances.
      Seeka remains focused on improving profitability and directing cash flow to debt reduction while
      sustainably investing in its long term future.


      Improved growing conditions
      In New Zealand, yields bounced back and total volumes increased. Growing conditions across all
      regions were significantly better in 2024, although lingering water stress issues were experienced in
      Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne and the Hawke’s Bay. Growers in these regions are switching to
      rootstocks that perform better in wet conditions to increase resilience.
      In the Te Puke, Ōpōtiki and wider Bay of Plenty region where Seeka sources 85% of its kiwifruit,
      growing conditions were much better and yields excellent. Some localised wind damage was
      experienced by the industry in the Katikati region, however, outside of that, growing and harvest
      conditions were good.
      The Australian results have also improved, with Seeka’s Australia operations benefitting from
      the combination of better growing conditions along with a new crop protection programme
      incorporating new sprays that better protect kiwifruit in a Psa environment. Overall, Seeka Australia
      produced 2.3m kilograms of kiwifruit – up 164% on prior year. The new crop protection programme
      will likewise benefit the Australian kiwifruit orchards in development which are forecast to come into
      production starting from 2026.

                Operational excellence
                All aspects of Seeka's operations performed well. The detailed and disciplined planning process
                undertaken by Seeka together with full labour supply ensured all fruit was packed and stored
                efficiently and timely in accordance with operational protocols.
                A high proportion of growers delivered excellent quality fruit, enabling efficient and timely
                processing. Labour supply constraints have eased with the industry benefitting from an increased
                supply of workers for growing, harvesting and post-harvest operations. All post-harvest shifts were
                fully staffed across all regions for the first time in five years. The KKP automated packing machine
                continued to deliver incremental performance improvements.
                Our mix of automated and manual packlines gives Seeka the flexibility to efficiently handle variable
                fruit quality at harvest. Quality lines with low rejects can be quickly and efficiently processed on
                Seeka’s highly automated packing machines, while orchards with compromised fruit can be cared
                for with intensive manual grading. This mix of packing technology allowed Seeka to provide a timely
                harvest to all supplying growers including those that experienced difficult growing conditions.
                Seeka’s continuing focus on quality has again delivered low onshore fruit loss and excellent offshore
                quality in the 2024 season to date. New Zealand fruit loss at the six month mark is currently half the
                2023 rate, which in itself was an excellent result.


                Capacity
                Capacity has not been stretched in the year, positioning the Company well for future volume
                increases. Forward capacity planning remains key, and we are carefully planning and navigating for
                future crop in all growing regions.
                Seeka has made significant investments in capacity and automation, with upgrades at both Oakside
                and Seeka Gisborne enhancing capacity and throughput. We were set to undertake controlled
                atmosphere for SunGold at Oakside, but decided against it due to the available packing capacity.
                We continue to investigate and implement automation innovation that delivered payback and
                capacity gains.
                Seeka continues to invest in quality accommodation for seasonal workers. The new accommodation
                facilities at Sharp Road called Turanga Whetu (“Star Base”) have been completed and are being
                actively marketed for sale and lease back.

      Dividends
      The Board has determined it is not appropriate to pay a dividend at this time. The Board will consider
      dividends later in the year on confirmation of full year guidance.


      Forward focus
      Your Company has been through an extended period of challenges, with last year’s volumes, in
      particular, impacting Company profitability. We have successfully managed through these challenges
      and come out stronger, with this year’s record crop of 43m class 1 trays restoring profitability.
      Seeka operates in a seasonal industry, with a significant portion of our earnings delivered in the first
      six months of the year. Given the strong interim result, we expect a return to full year profitability,
      with profit before tax expected to be in the range of $17.0m to $21.0m compared to a loss of $21.0m
      in the prior year.
      While it is too early to make a reliable prediction on the 2025 crop, winter chill units in 2024
      are currently better than at the same point last year in all regions lifting the probability of a good
      budbreak. The Indian Ocean Dipole remains in the neutral phase, which means a change to La Niña
      from El Niño will not be known until later this year.
      Your Company and its people have worked hard to deliver an important turnaround in results. We
      remain focused and committed to continuing improvements.
      We thank our people, stakeholders and growers for their hard work and continuing support.

         Basis of preparation
         This section sets out the Group's accounting policies that apply to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the
         interim reporting period ended 30 June 2024. Accounting policies which are limited to a specific note are described in that note.

         Reporting entity and statutory base
         The condensed interim financial statements presented are those of the condensed consolidated Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as Seeka
         Limited or the Company. The group is referred to as the Group, Seeka, or Seeka Group.
         Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets Conduct (FMC)
         Reporting Entity for the purposes of the FMC Act 2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the NZX main board equity
         security market (NZX Main Board).

         Nature of operations
         Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
         In New Zealand the Group provides orchard management, orchard leasing, post-harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit, avocado,
         citrus, persimmon, and Kiwiberry industries. Seeka manufactures and sells the Kiwi Crush™ and Kiwi Crushies product range along with avocado
         oil. The Group also provides retail and ripening services for imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale market.
         In Australia, Seeka owns, leases and operates orchards and associated post-harvest assets, making the Group one of the largest producers and
         suppliers of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of European pears, plus other fruits, including plums and jujube dates.

         Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
         Group condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the interim reporting period ended 30 June 2024 have been prepared in accordance
         with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (NZ GAAP) and comply with the New Zealand International Financial Reporting
         Standards (NZ IFRS) and other reporting standards as applicable to profit-oriented entities. Specifically, Group condensed interim financial
         statements have been prepared in accordance with NZ IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. This condensed consolidated interim financial
         information does not include all of the information required for the full annual audited financial statements and should be read in conjunction with
         the annual audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS.
         The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed financial statements are set out below.
         The condensed financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) on 22 August 2024. The Directors do not have the
         authority to amend the condensed financial statements after issue.

         Summary of significant accounting policies
         Other than detailed above, the accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the annual audited financial statements for the year ended
         31 December 2023, as described in those annual financial statements.
         Where a change in the presentational format of the financial statements has been made during the period, comparative figures have been
         restated accordingly.

         Going concern assumption
         The condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
         The Directors have considered the ability of the Group to operate as a going concern for at least the next 12 months from the date of signing these
         condensed financial statements.
         The Directors have concluded that the Group will continue to operate as a going concern and the condensed financial statements are prepared on
         that basis.

         Seasonal nature of Group operations
         Seeka's core business is providing supply chain services to New Zealand and Australia's horticulture industries. A high proportion of
         Group revenue is generated and cost of sales incurred in the autumn when produce is harvested and prepared for market. Correspondingly,
         approximately 80% to 100% of Group gross profit is recorded in the condensed interim report. Seasonal fluctuations impact the timing of gross
         profit, particularly the amount and quality of kiwifruit inventory remaining in store at 30 June.

         Goods and services tax (GST)
         The condensed statement of profit and loss and condensed statement of comprehensive income have been prepared so that all components are
         stated exclusive of GST. All items in the condensed statement of financial position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and
         payables, which include GST invoiced.

         Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the entity
         There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and are effective that are expected to have a significant impact
         on the Group.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments engage in business activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a manner consistent with
the internal reports provided to the chief decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the allocation of resources alongside
operational outcomes, such as EBITDA and EBIT, and are responsible for setting strategic direction.
The Group has five operating segments:
– Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the retail sector.
– A single Australian operating segment covers the integrated supply chain service for the Group’s Australian-grown fruit.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs and other
income from the sale of assets recorded in the condensed statement of profit or loss are allocated to all other segments. Transactions between
segments are conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated on consolidation.
Segment information is prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations
The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts) whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the orchard
  owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into productive orchards, pays all development and production costs, owns all crops for
  the term of the lease, and shares profit with the landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post harvest operations
The Group provides post-harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and persimmon industries. This includes all crops from the Group’s
orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from independent orchard owners.
Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This includes
fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post-harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and ripening
services for imported fruit, and operates a wholesale market.
Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi Crush™, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and hospitals, along
with post-harvest services for Kiwiberry.
All other segments - New Zealand
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower services and overhead sections recorded in the condensed statement of profit or
loss, and impairment and revaluations of other assets not attributed directly to any other segment. It also includes the gain on sale from assets
that had been classified as held for sale, and are not attributed directly to any other segment.

Australian operations
The Group grows, provides post-harvest services, and retails all produce from orchards the Group owns or leases in Australia. The main products
are kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears, jujubes and plums which are primarily sold in Australia.




EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors
and management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expenses associated
with debt and leases (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large
investments in fixed and leased assets (EBITDA).

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

At 30 June 2024, Seeka classified the RSE accommodation Turanga Whetu, and adjoining coolstore facility, workshop and offices, as held for
sale. Turanga Whetu is Seeka's newly-completed, 140 bed accommodation complex at Sharp Road, Katikati, New Zealand. Construction was
completed in 2024 and the property has been actively marketed since May 2024. It is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is
expected to sell in the next 12 months.
At 30 June 2024, no Northland orchards (Jun 2023 - 16.6 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. At 30 June 2024, the
remaining orchard was unsold and does not meet the criteria for being classified as held for sale and therefore was transferred to property, plant
and equipment while further development is undertaken and until such time as a sale is highly probable. Seeka is committed to the sale of this
orchard and as the property is being actively marketed and is available for immediate sale in its present condition, a sale is still possible.
All assets classified as held for sale at 30 June 2024 are included in the "All other segments" segment. At 30 June and 31 December 2023, all
assets classified as held for sale were included within the Orchard operations segment.

         Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
         appropriate asset class.
         Land and buildings
         Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on at least a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
         any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by CBRE Group Inc.,
         independent registered valuer.
         In Australia valuations were last completed at 31 December 2022 by Opteon (Goulburn North East Vic) Pty Ltd, independent valuers based in
         Victoria, Australia.
         As at 30 June 2024, the Directors believe there are no indicators that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings differs materially
         from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue this class of assets at 30 June 2024.
         Impairment
         In the six months to 30 June 2024, no assets have been impaired. In the six months to 30 June 2023, $0.43m of hail netting assets in Australia
         and $0.12m of fixed electrical assets were impaired.




         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         At 31 December 2023, 52% (Dec 2022 - 42%) of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was externally revalued in line with policy.
         Additionally, 25% were adjusted based on a desktop fair value calculation. Valuations for land and buildings have remained stable in the six months to
         June 2024, and have remained consistent with the fair values recognised at 31 December 2023.
         In Australia valuations were last completed at 31 December 2022 by Opteon (Goulburn North East Vic) Pty Ltd, independent valuers based in Victoria,
         Australia.
         Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued in 2023 could have caused a movement in land and buildings of between
         0.82% and 3.79%. This was not considered a material movement in land and building values.
         Independent valuations will be obtained at 31 December 2024 in line with the accounting policies of the Group.

Impairment tests for goodwill
At 30 June 2024, indicators of impairment existed, including Seeka's market capitalisation being less than net assets. In response the Group has
performed impairment tests on all cash generating units (CGUs), in addition to CGUs with goodwill balances to ensure that future cash flows of
the CGUs and the Group support the fair value of the assets.
The impairment tests have been performed using a value in use calculation model. No impairment was identified.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value-in-use), with a terminal value
beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated in this note.
The assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margins for the cash generating units are determined based on
forecast crop volumes, past financial performance and the Board's expectation of future market dynamics, plus the Group's current year forecasts
and five year financial plans.
The impairment tests have a conservative forward looking growth profile of kiwifruit volumes over the five years, however the 2024 harvest
was significantly better than the previous two years for Seeka, with a 44% increase in packed trays in New Zealand, 164% increase in kiwifruit
volumes in Australia, and earnings guidance of between $17m and $21m, a significant increase on the $21m net profit before tax loss in the 12
months ending 31 December 2023.
The Goodwill and asset value allocated to the post harvest CGU is supported by historical profitability, increasing volume forecasts, and forecast
growth of the kiwifruit industry and returns. The headroom in the post harvest CGU has increased from December 2023, with working capital
peaking in June but forecasts increasing the calculated Value in Use to a greater degree.
The impact of climate change has been incorporated to the extent that it impacts the forecasts and considered as part of scenario planning from
an operational capacity planning perspective.
Seeka has a long history of adapting to the environment, such as when Psa arrived in New Zealand and the industry pivoted to the SunGold
variety, alongside past climatic events such as droughts, hail, and floods. The business will continue to adapt to the changing environment.


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The goodwill impairment tests require judgement to determine the appropriate forecast cash flows and inputs into the calculations. The primary
estimates relate to the forecast EBITDA growth rates, discount rates, WACC and terminal growth rates.

         7. Biological assets - crop
         Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
         Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears, other pears, avocado, citrus, jujube, and plum crops growing on leased and
         owned orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.

         The Board has assessed the fair value of the term loans as the outstanding balance at balance date.
         At 28 June 2024, Seeka extended 69% of the facilities to 31 January 2026, and 31% to 31 January 2027. The 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024
         banking covenants are set on a “step down” basis to enable Seeka to reach its long-term covenants of 3.25x for the net leverage ratio and 2.00x
         for the interest cover ratio. Seeka remains committed to reducing debt and building headroom into its banking covenants.
         On 5 February 2024, an additional $20m credit line was secured through to 16 July 2024. Following this facility being fully repaid on 15 July 2024,
         Seeka's total available facility decreases to $201 million.
         Seeka’s $201 million banking facility is provided as a Sustainability-Linked Loan that incentivises Seeka to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
         increase solar energy generation capacity, and improve health and safety across its workforce. Seeka will pay a lower interest rate for achieving
         annual sustainability targets, and a higher interest rate if they are not met.
