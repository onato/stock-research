    Introducing Seeka

    Our produce business


    Seeka grows, processes and supplies premium, healthy fruit to domestic and international consumers.

    We work along the supply chain, helping growers develop and operate their orchards, provide harvest
    and post-harvest services, supply Zespri's export programme, and market produce in New Zealand,
    Australia, and to other high-value markets.
    Growers benefit from an integrated supply service that cares for their produce from the orchard to point of sale. We pride
    ourselves on careful handling and inventory management that optimises total crop value and grower returns. Our supply chain
    partners benefit from a quality-driven service that connects consumers to the sustainable production and supply of quality fruit.
    Operating throughout New Zealand and Australia, and recruiting from the Pacific and Asia, we enhance regional economic
    development, and are a responsible employer that cares for the welfare of our workforce and communities.
    By operating an integrated service, we are working to return value to Seeka shareholders by growing our revenue streams and
    operating margins. This includes adding new services and expanding the reach of our core supply chain service.

    Our core business
    We are founded on kiwifruit and have expanded to be New Zealand's and one of Australia’s largest
    kiwifruit growers. We grow and supply New Zealand kiwiberry, avocado, persimmon and citrus and
    Australian nashi, pears, jujube and other fruits.
    We are a large regional employer, operating packing and coolstore facilities in all major kiwifruit and avocado growing regions
    in New Zealand’s North Island. Seeka also operates orchard and post-harvest facilities in Victoria, Australia, with the Australian
    market supplied with Seeka fruit all year round.
    We focus on supply chain management and have extended our services to include maturity testing to the wider kiwifruit
    industry, the importation and conditioning of tropical fruits for New Zealand retailers, and the production and selling of avocado
    oil and the digestive aid, Kiwi Crush™.
    At Seeka, we strive to deliver excellence from orchard to market.

   From the Chair and Chief Executive



   The 2023 harvest was a difficult season right across the horticultural sector. Seeka was impacted by an industry
   wide drop in kiwifruit yields which led to an operating loss. A warm wet winter, cyclones and hail significantly
   impacted kiwifruit yields across New Zealand and Australia.

   Seeka handled 29.8 million trays of class 1 New Zealand kiwifruit in 2023, compared with 42.0 million in 2022.
   Revenue for the 12 months ended 31 December 2023 was $300.9 million, down from $348.4 million in 2022.
   The $47.5 million reduction in revenue produced a $14.5 million loss after tax in 2023.

   In response to the challenging financial year, Seeka:
   –     Suspended dividends
   –     Reviewed operations to lower the base overhead structure
   –     Established a captive insurance structure to slow the impact of rising insurance costs
   –     Reduced capital expenditure, while prioritising renewal of fire risk equipment, and
   –     Sought and obtained the support of Seeka’s banking syndicate to renew facilities and obtained covenant
         waivers.
   The weather plays a vital role in a successful crop and over the course of the last 18 months, Seeka has
   experienced it all. Winter 2022 was unseasonably warm and regions missed their normal winter chill contributing
   to an indifferent budbreak, particularly in Northland and Te Kaha. A heavy frost in October 2022 impacted many
   orchards right across the growing regions, with a number devastated.
   In November 2022, record-breaking flooding and hail occurred in Shepparton, which impacted Seeka’s Australian
   orchards, while New Zealand experienced continual rain through the Christmas period, followed by Cyclones Hale
   and Gabrielle, which caused severe damage in the Hawke’s Bay and Tairāwhiti Gisborne regions. In May 2023,
   there was a significant hail event in the Bay of Plenty and while some orchards only experienced light damage,
   others suffered total loss.
   These events lowered crop volumes and yields and decreased packhouse efficiency, slowing the machines and
   reducing margins as additional grading staff were employed to remove damaged fruit. Seeka worked to provide
   the best possible outcome for impacted growers and delivered them exceptional results.
   With warm, moist growing conditions, 2023 harvest produced SunGold kiwifruit with below-normal dry matter.
   This occurred in a year when Zespri had increased dry matter maturity thresholds as a mechanism to improve
   the consumer taste experience. This convergence resulted in a significant volume of quality SunGold kiwifruit not
   being packed for export and sold on the domestic market.
   Despite the challenging growing conditions, Seeka’s operational performance for growers and Zespri was
   excellent. Seeka delivered extremely low onshore and offshore fruit loss, and the best offshore fruit quality in the
   industry. Last season's issue of fruit quality had been resolved through a focus on operational excellence, including
   innovative picking technology, a tailored packing service that matched the needs of each crop, and precision
   inventory management that ensured fruit was loaded out at the optimal time.

   The new automated packing machine at KKP performed
   well and delivered the anticipated throughput and capacity
   gains. Automation upgrades at both Oakside and Seeka
   Gisborne enhanced site capacity and throughput.
   Seeka’s mix of automated and manual packing plant
   provides the flexibility to efficiently process weather
   damaged fruit. Quality lines can be quickly and efficiently
   processed on Seeka’s highly-automated packing machines,
   while crop from damaged orchards can be cared for with
   intensive manual grading. This mix of packing technology
   allows Seeka to provide a timely harvest to all supplying
   growers.
   To drive efficiencies, Seeka has invested in reporting
   systems, utilising Power BI that tracks fruit maturity on the
   orchard, prioritises the harvest programme, and monitors
   fruit inventory quality from the grader to the markets. The
   next wave of Seeka innovation will incorporate artificial
   intelligence into Seeka’s decision making systems.

   Outlook
   Seeka is focused on restoring the profitability of the
   Company in 2024 and reducing debt, while maintaining
   the excellent operational performance achieved in 2023
   for its growers and customers. Having invested in capacity
   and automation, Seeka is containing capital spend to
   maintenance, risk reduction, and automation with proven
   financial return.
   All indications point to volumes rebounding in 2024, with
   orchards benefitting from far better growing conditions
   during the key summer period, and kiwifruit vines holding
   high levels of fruit. Having built our capacity to handle more
   than 50 million trays, Seeka has the infrastructure, systems
   and personnel to manage the near-term growth in kiwifruit
   volumes from our supplying growers.
   The Board and management would like to thank Seeka’s
   people, shareholders and growers for their resilience, their
   loyalty and their continued support.

   Financial review



   Seeka Limited achieved a gross profit of $48.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2023. This was
   a 29% decrease on 2022 as industry-wide low kiwifruit yields impacted revenue and the profitability of
   the Group’s core business. EBITDA 1 was $26.0 million, down $20.1 million year on year.



   Orcharding regions recorded their wettest summer, which along                                            Group revenue

   with Cyclones Hale and Gabrielle, regional flooding, frosts and hail,
   delivered a material reduction of New Zealand kiwifruit production.
   Poor growing conditions in the two seasons since 2021 have                                                                       348.4

   Net loss after tax
   Seeka’s investments in post-harvest infrastructure and automation
   have been matched to the growth in kiwifruit plantings. The large
   downturn in yields, however, meant facilities were underutilised, and
   the core kiwifruit business unprofitable.                                                                 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23

   Seeka recorded a $14.5 million net loss after tax, down from a $6.5
   million profit in 2022. This came from a $19.6 million drop in gross
   profit, $3.8 million of non-cash impairments and revaluations,

   While lower yields also impacted orcharding operations, revenue
   increased 7% to $86.5 million, aided by a substantial lift in
   tray payments for SunGold and Hayward kiwifruit from leased

   Orcharding
   Led by GM Orchards, Barry Penellum




                                                 Orcharding grew 11.4 million Class 1 trays of kiwifruit compared to
                                                 17.0 million trays in 2022. The main growing regions were hit by a
         Revenue                                 record wet summer, which was compounded by regional flooding,
         – Leased and long term leased
                                                 hail and frost.
           orchards: costs plus profit share
                                                 Yields were much lower than expected. The average Hayward yield from Seeka’s
         – Managed orchards: costs plus          orcharding operations was a record low 6,730 trays per hectare, down 30% on
           management fees
                                                 2022, and down 45% on 2021. SunGold average yield of 9,295 trays per hectare

                  29%
                                                 was down 23% on 2022, and down 35% on 2021. The La Niña weather system
                                                 which has impacted the last two seasons has now ended, and Seeka is expecting
                                                 increased kiwifruit volumes in 2024.
                 of Group revenue
                                                 Seeka also grew 1,900 tonnes of avocado (2022: 1,700 tonnes) and 163 tonnes of
                                                 Kiwiberry (2022: 116 tonnes), on orchards which it either owned or managed.
                                                 With the normalisation of border control, labour supply has improved and
                                                 orcharding is benefiting from the return of skilled RSE employees.
                $86.5m                           2023 orchard operations revenue of $86.5 million was up $6.0 million on 2022,
                    Up 7% on                     reflecting a strong increase in kiwifruit tray returns which helped offset the large
                   FY22 $80.5m                   drop in yields. EBITDA of $1.0 million was down on 2022's $4.6 million, reflecting
                                                 low kiwifruit yields. EBITDA was also impacted by the large drop in avocado yields
                                                 and market returns, which impacted the profitability of Seeka's avocado operations.
                                                 Seeka continues to co-invest alongside landowners and funding agencies to
                                                 develop high-value orchards, with 97 hectares currently under development with
         Assets                                  long-term supply commitments. Seeka has also directly invested $16 million to
         – Leased orchards: growing crops        develop 55 hectares of kiwifruit and 13 hectares of avocado on long-term leased
         – Long-term leased orchards:
                                                 land. Fruit volumes and the profitability of Seeka's orcharding operations are
           developing orchards and growing       expected to increase as these orchards reach full production.

   Post-harvest packed 29.8 million Class 1 trays of kiwifruit, down
   from 42.0 million trays in 2022. Hayward volumes were down 37%
   and SunGold volumes down 24%, both significantly impacted by                                      Revenue
   yield reductions.                                                                                 – Grading and packing service fee

   Kiwifruit inventory performance was excellent across all Seeka sites, with a focus

   fruit to the marketer Zespri. The New Zealand kiwifruit industry is built on providing
   the markets with high-quality fruit. Seeka's supply-chain performance is essential
   to grow markets and secure premium pricing for New Zealand growers.
   Avocado volumes and fruit quality were impacted by the poor growing season,
                                                                                                                61%

   and revenue from avocado export packing was significantly down. Seeka has been
   working with industry partners to rationalise supply chain services and re-establish
   a profitable business model for avocado growers.
   Seeka also packed 11.0 million kilograms of citrus and 0.8 million kilograms of
   persimmon on contract for third party marketers, both impacted by low yields.                          $182.4m
   Post-harvest revenue of $182.4 million was down 22% from last season                                        Down 22% on
   (2022: $233.8m) reflecting the large drop in volumes across all fruit categories.                           FY22 $233.8m
   EBITDA was $43.8 million compared to $59.0 million in 2022, with Seeka unable
   to realise the efficiency gains from the highly-automated facilities due to the low
   volumes.

                                                  revenue to $20.7 million, supported by higher returns from imported

   Seeka Australia grew and sold 3,309 tonnes of fresh fruit in 2023,
   down 32% on 2022 as severe flooding and hail impacted plant
   health and yields. Kiwifruit volumes fell 51%, pears were down                                                        Revenue

   While most fruit was marketed in Australia, including direct to large supermarket
   retailers, Seeka also exported a limited supply of its Australian-grown fruit to Asia
   at excellent prices. The demand for Australian-grown Hayward Green kiwifruit
   exceeded the volume Seeka could supply.
   The reduced volumes flowed through to a 26% drop in revenue to $10.4 million,
   and an EBITDA of $0.7 million.

   Seeka is forecasting strong growth in its Australian business, with $13 million
   invested in new orchard developments, including 63 hectares of kiwifruit, new pear
   varieties, and an expansion of jujube plantings.
   Seeka has established strong market demand for Seeka-branded produce
   in Australia, and is selectively exporting to Asia where it returns value. A                                                 $10.4m

                have high greenhouse gas potential.

         – Installed 345 kW of solar panels at Katikati
           post-harvest facility
                Increasing our production of renewable energy.

   Seeka's carbon footprint
   Seeka measures its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with ISO 14064-1:
   2018 - Greenhouse gases. Toitū Envirocare has verified Seeka’s GHG emissions inventory,                            Seeka's main
   providing assurance across the four emission categories since 2019.                                                category 1 emissions
   Seeka's approach to its carbon footprint is to prevent carbon emissions, then to reduce,
   and offset as a last resort. No carbon offsets were purchased between 2019 and 2023.
                                                                                                                               Refrigerants

   Intensity-based performance measures
   Seeka is in a fast-growing industry. While it is important to report our absolute carbon
   result, as an expanding business it is equally important to report our efficiency gains.
   Our total emissions are benchmarked against three intensity-based measures:
   –     Tonnes CO2e per $1,000,000 revenue
   –     Tonnes CO2e per 100,000 Class 1 trays packed
   –     Tonnes CO2e per permanent employee
   The 2022 drop in yields and a second drop in 2023 impacted the intensity measures.

   Climate-related risks and opportunities
   Climate change is both an opportunity and a threat to the business. A changing climate impacts the land and our people, and the
   quantity and quality of the fruit Seeka handles. Seeka is working to assess climate-related risks and impacts and is formulating
   strategies to ensure the business remains resilient in a changing environment.
   Over the past ten years, Seeka has expanded operations to encompass all major kiwifruit growing regions in New Zealand and
   to the Goulburn Valley in Australia. Seeka is growing and packing a bigger range of fruit, including kiwifruit, avocado, Kiwiberry,
   nashi, pear, plum, jujube, persimmon and citrus. By growing diverse crops in different regions, Seeka is building a knowledge
   base on how different soil types and climates impact plant health and fruit yields. These learnings are guiding Seeka's orchard
   practices and orchard developments.
   Seeka is committed to growing sustainable futures for our employees, growers, communities, and shareholders. Addressing
   climate change and creating appropriate mitigation and adaption strategies are core to enabling a sustainable future.
   Seeka is making its first disclosures of its climate-related
   risks and opportunities, as at 31 December 2023. Seeka's
   climate disclosures provide insights into potential risks and
   opportunities, and how Seeka is building resilience in a changing
   environment. The disclosures comply with the External
   Reporting Board’s (XRB’s) Climate-related Disclosures (NZ
   CS 1). Seeka’s climate-related risks are regularly reviewed and
                                                                              See Seeka's public climate disclosures at www.seeka.co.nz/climate-change

Going concern assumption
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors have carefully considered the ability of the Group to
operate as a going concern for at least the next 12 months from the
date of signing these financial statements.
The Directors have considered the economic environment, the
forward outlook for the kiwifruit industry, the forecast covenant
compliance, and have made due enquiry into the appropriateness of
the assumptions underlying the budgeting forecasts. The Directors
have considered the working capital position of the Group and noted
that the cash and cash equivalent balance of $5.2m and undrawn term
facilities of $20.0m provide sufficient headroom, alongside expected
future cash flows and an additional $20.0m credit line available
between February 2024 and July 2024, to support the business for
at least the next 12 months past the signing date of these financial
statements.
The Directors have concluded that the Group will continue to operate
as a going concern and the financial statements are prepared on that
basis.

         The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
         owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry crops.
         The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry from:
         – Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
           whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
           orchard owners.
         – Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
           productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
           owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
           landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
         – Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
           costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
         Post-harvest operations
         The Group provides post-harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
         citrus, persimmon and Kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops
         from the Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus
         crops from independent orchard owners.




         EBITDA and EBIT
         EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
         reflects operating cash flow generation.
         EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
         Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
         information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors
         and management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expenses associated
         with debt and leases (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large
         investments in fixed and leased assets (EBITDA).

         Turnover
         The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
         services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
         where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

         Accounting policies
         Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred, except where future economic benefits arise and they are
         recorded as a prepayment.
         Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
         Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are
         recognised in other payables. The employee liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating
         sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date,
and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability
in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit. Differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.



7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following table details the offset amounts.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future taxable
profits is probable and these losses will be utilised in the near future. $5.76m was recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax
losses (Dec 2022 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.

There are no material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

         At 31 December 2023, 13.5 hectares of Northland orchards (Dec 2022 - 16.6 hectares) were classified as held for sale. No growing costs have
         been attributed to the remaining orchards at 31 December 2023 as they are valued on a crop-off basis.
         At 31 December 2022, 750ML of permanent water entitlement in Victoria, Australia, was classified as held for sale. The sale of the water
         entitlement settled on 22 February 2023 for a consideration of $3.08m AUD.
         All assets classified as held for sale in 2023 are included in the orchard operations segment. In 2022, $3.3m related to the water entitlement held
         at December 2022, which was included in the Australian operations segment until its sale in February 2023.
         Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
         continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition,
         and the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within one year from the date of classification. The accounting standards
         allow for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control. As at 31 December 2023, one
         orchard of 13.5 hectares (Dec 2022 - one orchard at 13.5 hectares) has taken longer than 12 months to find a willing buyer, however Seeka remains
         committed to selling the property, is actively marketing it and sale is anticipated within the next 12 months. Assets held for sale are recorded at
         the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be used and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
appropriate asset class. At 31 December 2023, assets under construction relate to the Sharp Road Accommodation development, and further
investment relating to building upgrades and packhouse automation.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on at least a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by CBRE Group Inc.,
independent registered valuer. At 31 December 2023, 52% (Dec 2022 - 42%) of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was externally
revalued in line with policy. Additionally, 25% were adjusted based on a desktop fair value calculation. Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining
properties that were not revalued this year could cause a movement in land and buildings of between 0.82% and 3.79%. This is not considered a
material movement in land and building values.
In Australia valuations were last completed at 31 December 2022 by Opteon (Goulburn North East Vic) Pty Ltd, independent valuers based in
Victoria, Australia.
The valuers consider three different approaches in concert to arrive at a fair value;
1. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.
2. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the property with a current market rental being established and capitalising this at an
   appropriate rate of return that would be expected by a prudent investor. The 2023 year saw capitalisation rates move between (0.25%) - 0.50%
   since the previous valuations of the same properties, some of which may have been up to three years prior.

         3. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the investment method
            and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market rentals and estimated costs incurred
            to maintain land and buildings in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are sold in the terminal year (year 11).
         Significant unobservable inputs inherent in the land and building valuation process include potential market comparative rentals, and the market
         rental capitalisation rates. The higher the rental rate, the higher the fair value, and the higher the capitalisation rate, the lower the fair value.
         Significant changes in either of these inputs would result in significant changes to the fair value measurement. See below;
         1. Market rental rates - Packhouse rental rates as described in the valuation reports obtained in 2023 between $55/m2 - $130/m2 (Dec 2022 - $60/
            m2 - $130/m2). Coolstore rental rates were between $0.40/tray - $0.63/tray (Dec 2022 - $0.40/tray - $0.65/tray)
         2. Rental capitalisation rates - Capitalisation rates as described in the valuation reports obtained in 2023 were between 8.25% – 9.50% (Dec 2022
            - 6.00% - 8.75%).
         3. Discount rates – Discount rates as described in the valuation rates obtained in 2023 were between 9.23% - 10.37% (Dec 2022 – 6.50% - 9.00%).
         The net book value of land is $47.24m (Dec 2022 - $47.41m) and buildings is $223.61m (Dec 2022 - $203.53m), see note 29.
         The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax, of $7.47m (Dec 2022 - $9.74m).

         As a consequence of the building revaluations conducted December 2023, $9.08m (Dec 2022 - $6.38m) of accumulated depreciation was offset
         directly against the assets' cost or valuation, prior to revaluation.
         In the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group assessed the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and did not identify any material
         situations where the useful life of an asset or group of assets was not appropriate or within the existing accounting policy. In the year ended 31
         December 2022, the useful lives of buildings was reviewed and re-estimated to be 50 years from the date of the estimate.
         The following table details the depreciated value of land and buildings if they were to be stated on a historical cost basis.

         Impairment of bearer plants
         For the year ended 31 December 2023, $0.95m (Dec 2022 - $0.14m) of assets were impaired, which relate to bearer plant assets in Australia that
         were removed.
         Impairment of land, buildings, plant and equipment
         For the year ended 31 December 2023, $0.53m (Dec 2022 - nil) of assets were impaired. This related to hail netting damaged in a hail event in
         Australia and electrical infrastructure damaged in an electrical surge in one of our packhouses in New Zealand. Both events were covered by
         insurance and in both instances assets were either replaced or in the process of being replaced as at 31 December 2023.



         Accounting policies
         Bearer plants
         Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear, jujube, avocado and other fruiting vines and trees on Group-owned and leased land. Bearer
         plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase or establish the asset.
         Land and buildings
         Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any subsequent
         improvements at cost, less depreciation. At each annual balance date, no less than one third of assets classified as land and buildings are revalued
         and those valuations are used to assess the appropriateness of the carrying values of all land and building assets held by the Group, which effectively
         revalue all land and buildings annually. Revaluations are performed more frequently if changing industry conditions may cause their carrying value
         to differ significantly from fair value. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the
         asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
         Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and buildings are accounted for through comprehensive income and other reserves,
         except where an asset's assessed fair value is less than the original cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
         Property, plant and equipment
         All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase the
         asset.
         Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
         that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs
         and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
         Asset impairments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated              – Furniture, fittings and equipment        5 - 15 years
using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
                                                                                 – Bearer plants                            4 - 25 years

estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased              Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.                               if appropriate, at balance date and an asset’s carrying amount is

– Vehicles                                    4 - 15 years                       are transferred to retained earnings.




Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 31 December 2023, 52% (Dec 2022 - 42%) of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was externally revalued in line with policy.
Additionally, 25% were adjusted based on a desktop fair value calculation.
Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause a movement in land and buildings of between 0.82%
and 3.79%. This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

         The amortisation period of software is four to five years.
         Remeasurement
         NZ IAS 38: Intangible assets (NZ IAS 38) states that fair value shall be measured by reference to an active market. Although there is an active
         register for water share trading, being the Victorian Water Register, it has been determined by the Australian Securities and Investments
         Commission (ASIC), with reference to AASB 138 (the Australian equivalent standard to NZ IAS 38), that because the shares are not sufficiently
         homogenous in nature, the majority of sales are negotiated off-market, and the quantity of sales transactions are relatively infrequent therefore an
         active market does not exist for water shares. The Group have recognised this determination and in response have remeasured the value of water
         shares to historical cost as at 1 January 2023.
         The impact of this change is to reduce the water share revaluation reserve to nil as at 1 January 2023. A gain on sale of $1.5m relating to the water
         share sale settled in February 2023, was reclassified to the statement of profit and loss.
         This change is not considered material for prior period restatement in financial statements.
         Water shares are an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual crops in Australia and are
         carried at historical cost. Such rights have an indefinite life and are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment. If events or changes in
         circumstances indicate impairment, the carrying value is adjusted to take account of any impairment losses.
         The Group’s portfolio of water rights is currently recorded at a historical cost value of $3.0m (Dec 2022 - $3.0m). A market value assessment was
         performed at the end of the financial year. This was completed by accessing the Victorian Water Register and determining the weighted average
         sales price for the applicable class of water rights. This value is then applied on a like for like basis to the Group’s water portfolio. As water prices
         fluctuate due to seasonal factors, current market rates have been valued internally for impairment testing purposes at $5.9m (Dec 2022 - $5.4m).
         Impairment tests for goodwill
         At 31 December 2023, the Group's market capitalisation was $107.07m compared to net assets of $259.95m. As a result, an impairment test
         was performed on all cash generating units (CGUs), in addition to CGUs with goodwill balances to ensure that future cash flows of the CGUs and
         Group support the fair value of the assets.
         Goodwill represents the 2022 acquisition of NZ Fruits, the 2021 acquisitions of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited (OPAC) and
         Orangewood Limited, the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete Coolstores Limited, and the 2018 acquisition of the Northland business.
         The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value-in-use), with a terminal value
         beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated in this note.
         The assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit is determined based on past
         performance and the Board's expectations of future market dynamics, plus the Group's five-year financial plans.
         The impact of a frost event in spring 2022, cyclones in January and February 2023, and a hail event in May 2023, along with a lower yield as a
         result of variable bud break have reduced the volume harvested in 2023. Leading in to harvest 2024, there have been favourable weather patterns
         across key growing periods with no significant adverse weather events impacting the harvest to date. This, and a favourable outlook for the Group
         and the industry, have been incorporated into the impairment tests. The Group is operating in an inflationary environment, with rising interest rate
         impacting discount rates across all CGUs and being incorporated in the impairment tests.
         Any financial impact of climate change is expected to fall outside of the planning period given the long-term nature of climate change. However,
         scenario planning is being carried out across the Company to prepare for the impact of climate change on future yields, varieties, and growing
         methods. Seeka has a long history of adapting to the environment, such as when Psa arrived in New Zealand and the business pivoted to
         the SunGold variety, alongside past climatic events such as droughts, hail, and floods. The business will continue to adapt to the changing
         environment.
         No impairment was noted in a CGU as a result of the impairments tests, either on the CGUs with or without goodwill allocated to them.
         The annual impairment tests of goodwill were performed at 30 November 2023. Impairment indicators were considered at 31 December 2023,
         however no indicators were identified that required any further impairment tests.
         Additions to goodwill
         There were no additions to goodwill in 2023.
         In the year ended December 2022, $3.54m of goodwill was recognised as a result of the NZ Fruits acquisition and a further $0.15m from updates
         to the goodwill acquired in the 2021 Orangewood acquisition. See note 19 for details of the business combination.
         Post-harvest CGU
         All goodwill at 31 December 2023 is included in the post-harvest CGU. The single post-harvest CGU reflects the operationally coordinated and
         financially interdependent nature of post-harvest operations across the regions serviced by Seeka. To best handle fruit at optimum maturity, and
         maximise post-harvest efficiency and flexibility, the regions are managed as one unit with mature fruit allocated to the next available facility. This
         means fruit flows and the associated cash flows are intrinsically linked across all regions. Due to this, a single CGU best reflects the nature of the
         post-harvest business.

1. The discount rate is calculated based on the specific circumstances of the cash generating unit and its operations, and is derived from its
   weighted average cost of capital.
2. The long term growth rate is based on the long term expected inflation rate, being within the RBNZ inflationary target of 1%-3%. The Group has
   set its terminal growth rates at 2% to ensure a long term conservative growth estimate has been applied in the impairment tests.
3. The EBITDA growth rate for the 2024 year assumes a return to average yields. The EBITDA growth rates in the long-term forecast sit between
   0-10%, which is considered conservative for the kiwifruit industry.
4. EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations.
Goodwill balances are assessed annually for impairment.
Post-harvest CGU
The goodwill relating to the post-harvest CGU is supported by historical profitability, with a positive outlook and significant growth path ahead.
Despite challenging weather conditions in the 2023 harvest season, the post-harvest segment operated profitably throughout the year. The
forecast cash flows assume a return to average yields and a return to normal growing conditions.
The impairment and recoverable amount of the CGU were calculated using the value-in-use method.
No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an impairment of goodwill.

         12. Biological assets - crop
         Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
         Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears, other crops growing on leased and owned orchards and yet to be harvested
         at balance date.
         The following table reconciles beginning balances to end balances for biological assets crop measured at fair value defined as level 3 in note 29.

         Crop where fair value cannot be measured reliably
         Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date therefore
         fair value is not able to be measured reliably and, as such, these crops are measured initially at cost less impairment.
         Crop valued at fair value
         Where a crop has achieved sufficient biological transformation, it is measured at fair value less costs to sell using unobservable inputs in the fair
         value assessment. These unobservable inputs include forecasted sales prices achieved once the crop is harvested and marketed for sale, if the
         forecast price was to increase so would the fair value of the crop.



         Accounting policies
         The Group's biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group's leased and owned orchards. All crops have a maturity period of
         less than one year and will be harvested within 12 months from the Group's balance date.
         Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell provided this can be measured reliably, otherwise they are measured at cost.
         When insufficient biological transformation has occurred fair value is not able to be measured reliably. Biological assets at cost are not depreciated as
         they are in the process of maturing.
         Fair value is determined as the estimated net market return.

13. Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities
The Group reports all leases on the balance sheet where it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset
throughout the period of the lease, with the exception of low value leases or leases less than 12 months.

         Accounting policies
         Lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, including any renewal periods that are likely to be exercised,
         discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate which ranges between 7.57% and 16.50%. The discount rate is based on the Group's
         incremental borrowing rate, being the rate the Group would borrow the funds required to purchase the asset. When determining the discount rate,
         Seeka considers that the value of the right-of-use lease asset should not be greater than the fair value of the underlying asset being leased.
         The Group’s right-of-use lease asset is equal to the lease liability on the day of lease inception, with the exception of sale and leaseback
         transactions where the asset is measured as the proportion of the carrying value of the asset sold of which the benefit is retained by the Group.
         The right-of-use lease asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Costs incurred with a lease that are not part of the
         cost of the right-of-use lease asset are expensed.
         All leases have been classified into one of the following asset classes:
         – Land and building - leases for rental of all properties, including packhouses and coolstores
         – Orchard - leases held for the development of productive orchards
         – Equipment - leases for equipment, including plant equipment and forklifts
         – Motor vehicles - leases for motor vehicles
         The Group leases various properties for the packing and cooling of kiwifruit, leases orchards to grow kiwifruit and avocados, and leases equipment
         and vehicles. The terms of the leases vary, with land and building leases ranging from 10 - 15 years, with one 99 year lease. Orchard leases range
         from 3 - 25 years, and equipment and vehicle leases range from 1 - 5 years.
         Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. In the case of orchard leases, only the fixed rental is recognised as a lease liability.
         Any variable consideration relating to profit share on the orchard leases is not accounted for as the profit share is only determined after a crop has
         been harvested and is not identifiable at the commencement of the lease. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a range
         of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interest in the leased assets that are
         held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
         The Group is exposed to potential future increases in land and building lease payments based on contractual market rent reviews that are not
         included in the lease liability until the rent review takes place.
         Lease payments are allocated between principal and lease interest. The lease interest is charged to the statement of profit and loss over the term
         of the lease.

Accrued income and other sundry receivables includes income to be received from orcharding operations on 382 hectares of leased and owned
orchards (Dec 2022 - 419 hectares).
A $0.26m provision for doubtful debts is recognised in the accounts (Dec 2022 - $0.24m).
Non-current trade receivables includes $1.81m losses carried forward on Hayward short term leased orchards to be recovered in a future period
(Dec 2022 - $2.20m). Non current receivables also include $1.56m (Dec 2022 - $3.06m) of long term receivable balances with agreed long-
term payment terms. The remaining balance of non-current trade receivables relates to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with
repayment terms of up to five years and is considered recoverable.




Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.

Accounting policies
Raw materials, work in progress, finished goods and produce are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct
materials and direct labour, and are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average cost. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sales costs.

The Board has assessed the fair value of the term loans as the outstanding balance at balance date.
On 30 June 2023, Seeka refinanced with a Sustainability-Linked Loan with its banking syndicate, which included extension of the facility maturity
dates and amendments to the banking covenants. Westpac NZ acted as the Sole Sustainability Coordinator, Agent and Mandated Lead Arranger,
and Bookrunner throughout the refinancing.
Seeka extended 66% of the facilities to 31 January 2025, and 34% to 31 January 2026, and obtained a waiver for the net leverage ratio and
interest cover ratio banking covenants for the 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023 test periods. The 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024
banking covenants are set on a “step down” basis to enable Seeka to reach its long-term covenants of 3.25x for the net leverage ratio and 2.00x
for the interest cover ratio. Seeka remains committed to reducing debt and building headroom into its banking covenants.
Seeka’s $201 million banking facility is provided as a Sustainability-Linked Loan that incentivises Seeka to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
increase solar energy generation capacity, and improve health and safety across its workforce. Seeka will pay a lower interest rate for achieving
yearly sustainability targets, and a higher interest rate if it misses agreed yearly benchmarks.
After the balance date, an additional $20m credit line has been secured from 5 February 2024 through to 16 July 2024.

         When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
         When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
         the facility.
         Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
         balance date.

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the number of fully

Grower loyalty share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit, avocado and Kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share scheme,
whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares based on their orchard's current or forecast production. This issue of up to 2.6m
shares was approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
In April 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 405 participating growers. The issue price of $4.76 per share was
funded by the Group making a $9.8m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying all product from
the participating orchards for three consecutive seasons the shares vest and participating growers can elect to pay the outstanding balance of their
loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.
In 2021, 1,917,165 shares issued to kiwifruit growers vested. In 2022, the remaining 144,638 shares issued to avocado growers vested, see note 21.
Employee share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible employees to participate in a three-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would be
allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business. In April 2019, 568,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 319
participating employees. The issue price of $4.76 per share was funded by the Group making a $2.7m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon
meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can elect to pay the outstanding
balance of their loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them. Shares issued under this scheme
vested in 2022, see note 21.



Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.



19. Business combination
Acquisition through amalgamation of New Zealand Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits)
In February 2022, the Group amalgamated NZ Fruits, a kiwifruit, citrus and persimmon post-harvest business based in Gisborne, East Coast, New
Zealand, into a newly-formed 100%-owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Seeka East Limited. NZ Fruits shares were cancelled with each share
being exchanged for 7.5016 shares in Seeka and $39.3495 cash. Seeka shares were issued based on a price of $5.2455 per Seeka share (equal to
the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 9 December 2021, with all fractions of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole
number).
The purchase was settled on 2 February 2022 for a consideration of $17.53m by the issue of 1,687,860 ordinary shares in Seeka at a market price of
$5.14 on the settlement date of 2 February 2022, being the market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), and a
cash consideration of $8.85m. The change in the share price on acquisition date had the impact of decreasing goodwill by $0.18m.
There are no acquisition or integration related costs included in overhead expenses in the year ended 31 December 2023 (Dec 2022 - $0.46m).
Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the fair values of the assets and liabilities disclosed above if more information comes
to light that suggests the values differ. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the
acquisition date.
There have been no updates to the initial fair values as disclosed in December 2022.

         of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued and outstanding during the period.
         Diluted earnings per share
         Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
         effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
         to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
         Net tangible asset per share
         Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

The foreign currency revaluation reserve records unrealised gains and losses on Group assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies.
The share entitlement reserve records the value of option benefits recognised on the Group's grower loyalty and employee share schemes as
detailed in this note.
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
– An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
– An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust
deed established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the sale of shares are used
to repay the debt owed to the Company.
The following table details movement in the share entitlement reserve relating to the employee share scheme.

At balance date the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted to employees and remain outstanding under the scheme was
42,000 (Dec 2022 - 369,998), representing 0.10% (Dec 2022 - 0.89%) of the shares of the Company on issue at that date.
Grower loyalty share scheme
Under the grower loyalty share schemes, shares were issued to a share trust in return for a debt owed back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvest seasons, with the final harvest season
being the avocado harvest season ending 31 March 2022. The option benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period.
At the end of the vesting period the grower had an option to either settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to
them, or to not have the shares transferred to them, whereby any outstanding debt was forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The proceeds
from the shares that vest or from the sale of shares was used to repay the debt owed to the Company.
In September 2021, the three-season supply commitment period for kiwifruit and Kiwiberry growers ended, and 1,917,165 shares vested.
In April 2022, the three-season supply commitment period for avocado growers ended, and 144,638 shares vested.
From the September 2021 vesting, 333,897 shares that were either ineligible for entitlement, or not accepted by growers, were sold on market for
a total net consideration of $1.41m.
The following table details the movement in the grower loyalty share scheme.

The scheme terminated April 2022 upon the end of the avocado grower commitment period, and at 31 December 2022 no options that were
granted to growers remain outstanding.
For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust on behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.

           Accounting policies
           The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss with
           a corresponding increase in the share entitlement reserve. For the Grower Loyalty Share Scheme (GLSS), the fair value of the grower loyalty received
           in exchange for the grant of the option is recognised as a discount against other income in the statement of profit or loss with a corresponding
           increase in share entitlement reserve. The fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, calculated using the Black
           Scholes pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
           When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those shares is transferred to retained earnings.
           Employee share scheme shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average Price
           (VWAP) calculation of the Company's shares during the period prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with further
           shares if that issue would result in the ESS having an interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.
           Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the debt
           between ESS and GLSS and the Group on behalf of the employee of the grower.
           Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited to share capital when payment for the shares is received.
           The ESS and GLSS have a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated to employees and growers. Annually the Group reviews the ESS
           scheme and decides upon the allocation of further shares and the price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS and GLSS
           are appointed for an unspecified term and may be removed by the Company at any time.

           Dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend
           reinvestment plan. No cash dividend payments were made during the year (Dec 2022 - $4.37m).
           On 20 January 2022, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend was paid 23 February 2022 to those
           shareholders on the register at 5pm on 28 January 2022. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with no discount to the strike price.
           Seeka dividend policy
           Seeka’s dividend policy is to declare and distribute dividends between 65% and 75% of Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) annually in conjunction with
           the release of the half year and full year results subject to due consideration of the Board and approval of the banking syndicate.
           In addition to this, following agreement by Seeka's Banking Syndicate to amend certain covenants, it is a requirement that dividends will only be paid
           if the net leverage ratio banking covenant in the most recent Compliance Certificate does not exceed 3.75:1.00 and they shall be less than or equal to
           75% of NPAT for the financial year.
           The net leverage ratio is calculated as total net debt less the $46m working capital facility, to adjusted EBITDA.
           Adjusted EBITDA is defined as pre IFRS 16 EBITDA, less non-cash gain and losses, extraordinaries, and equity accounted profit or loss.



           Accounting policies
           Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the period but not distributed at balance date.

All other financial assets measured at fair value are defined as level 3, see note 29.



Accounting policies
The fair values of the listed securities are based on the securities' closing share price at balance date. Where pricing information is available,
unlisted securities are revalued at balance date. All other unlisted securities are currently held at cost less impairment as it reasonably represents
current fair value. Other financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are held at their discounted present value of expected
cash flows as it reasonably represents current fair value. The carrying amount of all financial assets has been reviewed at balance date and any
impairment is recognised through the statement of profit or loss.

         In September 2023, the Group invested $0.1m of a total committed investment of $1.1m towards a 50% shareholding in Waihau Bay JV Limited
         Partnership, which is a Limited Partnership for a kiwifruit orchard joint investment venture between the Group and several Māori investment
         trusts in Waihau Bay.
         In December 2022, the Group invested $0.94m of a total committed investment of $1.4m towards a 64% shareholding in Ngutupiri General
         Partner Limited, which is a management company for a kiwifruit orchard joint investment venture between the Group and several Māori
         investment trusts in Te Kaha, Ōpōtiki. Seeka has influence over the entity but not control, as Seeka's rights are contractually limited, a 75% voting
         threshold is required for special resolutions, and Seeka cannot directly impact its returns.
         The Group owns a 33% share in TKL Logistics Limited, which is a logistics company that provides services for kiwifruit including transportation,
         vessel planning, and ECPI. Historically this company did not build any equity value. However, from 2022 the Group has recognised the value of its
         investment equivalent to its share of the TKL Logistics Limited's profits.
         Impairment of associates
         For the year ended 31 December 2023, an impairment of $1.41m (Dec 2022 – nil) was recognised in relation to Fruitometry Limited, which is
         recorded as an investment in associate. Fruitometry is an agri-tech start-up business that was impacted by lower demand than forecast due to
         two difficult growing seasons. A discounted cash flow model was used to value the investment and as a result an impairment was recognised. No
         further impairment in investments in associates was identified.
         The following table summarises the financial information of associates.

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the voting rights in
the entity or exercising significant influence via directors on the Board.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost and tested annually for impairment.
The Group's share of associates profits or losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and the carrying amount of the investment in the
statement of financial position.
Dividends or distributions received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

The Apanui Road Joint Venture is considered a joint operation based on the following:
– There is equal voting rights and influence;
– There is no investment vehicle that separates the entities from the parties to the arrangement; and,
– The legal form and contractual arrangements through which the investee operates give the parties rights to the individual assets and liabilities
  of the investee (rather than the net assets as a whole).
The orchards of Apanui Road Orchards Joint Venture have a finite life, are carried at their fair value and are included in the consolidated financial
statements.



Accounting policies
Investment in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and
obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
Joint operations
The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings.
Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the statement of financial position.

Australian produce
The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian operations. As
one of the largest growers and suppliers of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong relationships with key retailers.
The Group forecasts seasonal supply, monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme around the needs of key retailers and controls
product quality and supply to optimise market access and returns.
Seeka Australia is the Group’s single international operation, exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk includes future
commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed through borrowings in Australian
dollars, see note 17.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers,
including outstanding receivables, derivative financial instruments and committed transactions.
The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The Group's maximum
exposure is the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the statement of financial position.
For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require any collateral or
security to support financial instruments due to the quality of the financial institutions.
For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post-harvest
services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is therefore not considered significant.
Trade receivables
The Group applies the NZ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (NZ IFRS 9) simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Management factors in forward-looking information, including future crop and return forecasts,
and the macro economic environment when assessing the recoverability of trade receivables. Many outstanding receivables relate to debtors where
balances are secured by future crop returns. No adjustments were made to the assessment as a result of these factors.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment
profiles of sales over a 12 month period before 31 December 2023 and the corresponding historical credit losses during this period, adjusted for any
significant known amounts that are not recoverable. Management identifies any non-recoverable debts through regular conversations with debtors.
On that basis, the following table details the provision for doubtful debts.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure
that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity
requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.
When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.
At balance date, the Group had $200.79m (Dec 2022 - $210.56m) of available credit of which $177.58m (Dec 2022 - $151.26m) was drawn. All
credit lines are currently provided by a bank syndicate comprised of five lenders across New Zealand and Australia, where Westpac New Zealand
Limited acts as the syndicate agent lender, security trustee and lead lender.

         d. Capital risk
         Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
         support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
         The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
         The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
         The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

                                                                                                                                       2023            2022

         The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios, net leverage ratios,
         and earnings times interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants. The Group, however, obtained
         agreement from its banking syndicate in June 2023 to modify two of it covenants (net leverage and interest cover) to 31 December 2024.

         e. Price risk - equity securities
         The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position as
         investment in financial assets. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities, only some of which are publicly traded.
         A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity
         reserves.
         The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
         deemed necessary.
         The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through comprehensive income whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance is
         available. When no such reserve exists, any related loss is processed directly in the statement of profit or loss, otherwise available reserves are
         utilised to offset the loss.

         f. Cash flow interest rate risk
         The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
         continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
         hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.

         Accounting policies
         Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
         The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes. Fair value
         measurements are categorised into a three-level hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation techniques used.
         The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and investment in shares) is based
         on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid
         price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
         The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using
         valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses the appropriate method and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions at
         each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments held.
         The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Other techniques, such as estimated
         discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
         Trade receivable and payables
         The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to
         their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with unobservable inputs (level 3), reflects the assumptions that market
         participants would use when determining an appropriate price; additional disclosure is provided for the inputs and assumptions used in such
         cases.
         Land and buildings
         Fair value is based on an annual revaluation, which is performed on land and buildings based on at least a rolling three-year cycle by an
         independent valuer, with a minimum of one third of land and buildings assets valued each year using three different approaches as described in
         note 10.

The fair values of the interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are determined by Westpac New Zealand Limited and reviewed by the Board.
The gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship and through annual prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure
that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates,
maturities and notional amount. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts where purchases or receipts are expected to be settled in that
foreign currency. The Group does not hedge 100% of its loans or foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:
– the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan,
– differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans, or,
– trading ceases to exist in the foreign currency.
There was no material ineffectiveness during 2023 or 2022 in relation to the interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts.

         Accounting policies
         Derivative financial instruments and hedging
         Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value
         at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and
         effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
         Hedge accounting
         The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the relationship
         between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge
         transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is
         used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
         Cash flow hedge
         Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised
         or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
         cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is
         ultimately recognised in the statement of profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss
         that was reported in comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the statement of profit or loss within other gains / (losses).
         Derivatives and financial instruments
         The Board uses judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market. Valuation
         techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are based on quoted market
         rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by Westpac New Zealand Limited.

Accounting policies
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories in accordance with NZ IFRS 9:
– amortised cost for financial assets and liabilities,
– assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI),
– assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL),
– liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and
– other financial liabilities.
The classification of financial assets and liabilities under NZ IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which the financial instrument is
managed and its contractual cash flows characteristics.
On initial recognition, a financial instrument is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL.
Financial instruments are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model in which case all
affected financial instruments are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.
A financial instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL:
– it is held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows; and
– its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
  outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the
investment’s fair value in other comprehensive income. The election is made on an investment by investment basis.
All financial instruments not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.

          To the Shareholders of Seeka Limited

          Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
          Opinion
          We have audited the financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company), including its subsidiaries (the Group) on pages 24
          to 69 which comprise the Group’s statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the statement of profit or loss,
          statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and
          notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.
          In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group
          as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New
          Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) issued by the New Zealand Accounting
          Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

          Basis for Opinion
          We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs (NZ)) issued by the New
          Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
          Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in
          accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including
          International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board
          and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
          (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
          accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
          and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
          Our firm carries out other assignments for the Group in the area of agreed upon procedures in respect to the debt covenant
          compliance certificate. Subject to certain restrictions, partners and employees of our firm may also deal with the Group on
          normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Group. These matters have not impaired our
          independence as auditor of the Group. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

      any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon.
      In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
      consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
      audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
      material misstatement of this information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

      accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the New Zealand
      Accounting Standards Board, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
      financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for assessing the Group’s ability to
 continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
 accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but
 to do so.
 Auditor’s responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
 misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
 is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) will always detect a
 material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
 in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
 financial statements.
 A further description of the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the External
 Reporting Board’s website at: https://www.xrb.govt.nz/standards/assurance-standards/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/

 Restriction on use of our report
 This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
 state to the Company’s shareholders, as a body those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report
 and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other

        Governance



         Corporate governance statement
         As at 31 December 2023
         At Seeka we conduct our business safely and ethically within the legal and regulatory framework so we can deliver the best outcomes for our growers,
         clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.

         Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the recommendations in the NZX Corporate
         Governance Code, 1 April 2023 (the Code). Our practices are set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews Seeka's
         corporate governance structures against the eight principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures
         substantially meet Code recommendations. Any exceptions are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 85 of this annual report.

         Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.

         The Board approved this governance statement on 28 February 2024.



         Principle 1. Ethical Standards
         “Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
         followed throughout the organisation.”

         Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
         connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory, and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
         that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.

         Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”

         Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are
         promoted, with Seeka's Board reinforcing the company's expectations that employees will follow the highest standards of ethical behaviour. The code
         outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and model high ethical standards to all employees and
         stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”

         The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:
            • Conflicts of interest
            • Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property
            • Conduct, valuing individuals' differences and respecting all stakeholders
            • Dealing with gifts or gratuities
            • Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing
            • Compliance with laws and Seeka policies
            • Managing breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics

         Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy that applies to the Seeka team of directors, officers, senior managers and all employees, that prohibits
         team members from direct or indirect dealing in Seeka financial products when holding inside information, plus a duty of confidentiality that protects
         the dissemination and use of confidential company information.

         The Insider Trading Policy defines black-out periods during which restricted persons (defined below) are prohibited from trading in Seeka shares
         unless provided with a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to, and finishes the first trading day after, key
         events; being the half-year and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares.

         Restricted persons includes all directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts
         and companies controlled by such persons, and advisors. The policy also specifies that Seeka team members should not engage in short-term trading.

         Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chair of the Board, and the chair must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.

         No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.



         Principle 2. Board Composition and Performance
         “To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”

         Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interests of the company, to deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.


         Board charter and responsibilities
         The Board Charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the duties
         and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:
            • Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards that fully comply with relevant legislation
            • Compliance with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) and NZX Listing Rules

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Governance




  • Meeting obligations under environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles

  • Establishing key corporate objectives and strategies

  • Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies

  • Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance

  • Ensuring the Group uses adequate risk-management strategies

  • Issuing clear written delegation to the chief executive officer including detailing their responsibilities

  • Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication

The Board follows NZX corporate governance rules, including the directors' fiduciary duties to act in the Group's best interests, to exercise due skill
and care, and to comply with the Board charter and Group policies, procedures and codes, including ethics, insider trading and disclosures of trading
in Group shares. As required, directors are able to seek independent advice to aid decision making and have access to the external auditors without
management present.

The Board delegates to the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.


Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth to be
appointed between annual shareholder meetings for Board succession planning. This occurred on 1 February 2023, when non-independent director
Hayden Cartwright was appointed to the Board. At the annual shareholders meeting on 20 April 2023, shareholders elected Hayden Cartwright, and
non-independent director Martyn Brick retired, at which point the Board reverted to seven directors.

Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at
least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between governance and management, all directors are non-executive
and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.

Seeka’s Board is led by the independent chair Fred Hutchings. In the periods from 1 January to 1 February, from 20 April to 4 August, and since 1
October 2023, the Board has had a majority of independent directors. The following table outlines the transitions in Board composition in 2023.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually. The determination of each director's independence can be found at
www.seeka.co.nz/board-of-directors-investors/.

        Governance




         As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Four directors that served
         on the Board in 2023 are experienced in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka were
         considered non-independent directors;
           • Martyn Brick (retired 20 April 2023)
           • Hayden Cartwright (appointed 1 February 2023)
           • Ratahi Cross; also an appointee of large Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited.
           • Stewart Moss

         During the year the Board had five independent directors. Director independence is defined as not having an interest, position or relationship that
         could impact decision making;
           • Fred Hutchings, Board chair and Remuneration Committee chair
           • Sharon Cresswell (appointed 1 October 2023)
           • Robert Farron, Audit and Risk Committee chair (resigned 4 August 2023)
           • Cecilia Tarrant, Sustainability Committee chair, and
           • Ashley Waugh (Audit and Risk Committee chair, from 4 August 2023)


         Director appointments and induction
         As required, the chair establishes a Nominations Committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
         complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
         annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
         to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.

         Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the Group’s
         strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the Board.

         The chair undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the Nominations
         Committee and external advisors.

         While there is no maximum term, the Board annually reviews director length of service and any potential impact on director independence. When
         the Board recommends the re-election of a director whom has served longer than 12 years, it will explain to shareholders its rationale for supporting
         re-election.

         At the April 2023 annual shareholders meeting, non-independent director Martyn Brick retired, having served 10 years.


         Director profiles
         Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 86 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
         director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 88 of this annual report.


         Diversity
         Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
         understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.

         The Board works to optimise diversity across directors, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity in gender, culture
         and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key clients, creating
         unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns. Notably Ratahi Cross of Ngāi Tukairangi is a lecturer in Māori history.

The Board considers the composition of its independent directors a relevant measure of Board diversity. In FY23, following a director resignation and
an appointment, the number of independent directors that identify as female increased to 50% (FY22: 25%), with the percentage of all directors and
senior managers that identify as female increasing to 29% (FY22: 20%).


Diversity policy
Seeka is committed to providing an inclusive environment that supports a diversity of thinking and skills. Aspects of diversity include gender, ethnic
background, religion, marital status, culture, disability, economic background, education, language, physical appearance and sexual orientation.

Seeka's Diversity Policy promotes equal employment opportunities, and while it does not set measurable objectives, the Group has a very large
workforce drawing on local communities, as well as people from the Pacific and Asia through the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) scheme.

During the year ended 31 December 2023, Seeka performed in adherence to the principles of our Diversity Policy.


Professional development
Directors are supported to undertake professional development through individual training and by attending relevant courses.


Evaluation of board, committee and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chair undertakes an annual review of Board, committee and director performance. The chair's 2023 review found that
the Board, committees and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified by the Board Charter.



Principle 3. Board Committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”

The Board has three permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance functions, while
retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.

All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the Audit and Risk, Sustainability, Remuneration, and Nominations Committee Charters biennially.


Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board, except during succession planning when an eighth director may be appointed until the
next annual shareholders meeting, at which point the Board reverts to seven directors. To provide effective and transparent committee governance,
while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent director, with
committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors to provide the best skill set. The Audit and Risk Committee
Charter specifies a majority of independent directors.

The current standing committees and their members are:

         In the event of a takeover offer, the Board Charter provides for the formation of an ad-hoc Initial Response Committee and an Independent Takeover
         Response Committee to enact the procedures and protocols of the Board's Takeover Response Manual.

         To date there has been no need to convene an Initial Response Committee meeting or form an Independent Takeover Response Committee.

         While the Board considers the current range of committees, comprehensively manages the governance of Seeka’s business, and provides the best
         outcomes for shareholders and other stakeholders, the Board Charter allows ad-hoc committees to be formed as required to aid Board decision
         making.

         The Board and all committee meetings achieved their quorum in 2023 of having at least two-thirds of directors at each Board meeting and a
         minimum of two member directors at each committee meeting. The following table reports Board and committee meeting attendance in 2023, see
         page 87 for changes to Board and committee membership during the year.

Principle 4. Reporting and Disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”

Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a mid-
year performance update, along with regular operational updates to growers.

Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chair of the Board, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for
identifying material information between Board meetings. At every Board meeting the Board considers whether there is relevant material information
which should be disclosed to the market.

As stewards of around 4500 hectares of orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and
international guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P
standard for good agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food.
See www.globalgap.org.

Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.

In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit returns;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.

Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual financial statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides
management support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational
performance for their fruit.

Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer provide a letter of representation to the Board confirming that the financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and fairly present the
financial position of the Group and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year. Seeka also considers environmental, social and
governance impacts, and discloses to the market any environmental factors that may materially affect operations.

Seeka's Sustainability Committee provides strategic guidance on its environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework, targets, measures and
performance. Since 2020, Seeka has been reporting its ESG initiatives in the annual and interim reports, and in June 2023 Seeka published its second
stand-alone sustainability report.

Seeka's 2023 Sustainability Report details Seeka's journey to be a sustainable business and Seeka's aim to be net zero carbon by 2050, and an
employer of choice that provides excellent service to Seeka customers while supporting the wellbeing of our communities.

Seeka began measuring emissions in 2019 using the Ministry for the Environment's carbon footprint workbook, before calculating its 2020, 2021
and 2022 footprint using the internationally recognised standard ISO 14064-1: 2018 - Greenhouse gases, with the results verified by Toitū Envirocare.
Using this data, Seeka has a platform to understand its impact on the environment, identify key areas of emissions, and monitor three intensity-based
performance indicators; tonnes CO2e per $1 million of revenue, per 100,000 Class 1 trays packed, and per permanent employee.



Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”

Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chair uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration within
a two year period, with shareholders approving any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in April 2022, when
the pool limit was set at $610,000 per annum. As part of Board succession planning, the Board had eight directors from 1 February 2023 until the 20
April 2023 annual shareholders meeting, after which the Board reverted to seven directors.

As determined by the Board, the directors are remunerated by a base director fee, a Board chair fee, and chair or membership fees for three Board
committees as per the following schedule that was presented to shareholders in April 2022. The total Board chair fee will not exceed $140,000,
irrespective of whether the chair would otherwise be eligible for committee fees.

        Governance




         As per the remuneration policy set out in the Board Charter, directors are remunerated by fixed fees reflecting the time commitment and
         responsibilities of the Board and committee membership, with no equity-based remuneration or performance incentives. The Board has never
         proposed a director retirement payment, and Seeka's Constitution requires that any such proposal would first require shareholder approval. Directors
         are encouraged but not required to own Seeka shares. Director shareholdings are disclosed on page 89.
         The following table reports the annual allocation of the pool in 2023, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. Non-italics are committee
         members at year end, italics are part-year membership in 2023, see page 87 for details. No other benefits were provided to directors.

         Chief executive officer remuneration
         The review of the chief executive officer’s remuneration is undertaken by the remuneration committee with the remuneration package the
         responsibility of the Board. Michael Franks was appointed chief executive officer in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual
         remuneration that covers base salary, vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.

         The following table reports chief executive officer remuneration for 2023.

                                                                                                                                  Annual

         1. Benefits are delivered through vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance.

         Performance incentive

         The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 73% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set by the Board,
         including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For the 2023 financial year, the chief executive officer
         earned a $142,350 performance incentive. This payment was made in 2024 (FY22: Nil).



         Principle 6. Risk Management
         “Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
         that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”

         The Board considers risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
         optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific
         focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.

         While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
         and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
         balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
         Principles and Guidelines.

         Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
         performance against budget and forecasts.

         Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post-harvest processing and fruit handling facilities. In 2023,
         as part of a long-term risk management strategy, Seeka established Seeka Risk Management Limited; a captive insurance company registered in the
         Cook Islands, to provide the Group with direct access to the international reinsurance market.

The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian produce handling and
marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating
environments when assessing material risk.

The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated
with being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing
revenue from more points along the value chain.

The following summarises the key material risks which the Board have identified and the associated mitigation strategies.

Health and safety
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.

Our people work in multiple, complex environments, and we focus on integrating safety into everything we do. Over the full year, the Group employed
more than 6,150 people, with Group salary and wages equating to 1,929 full time equivalents.

         1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of hours worked.
            TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
         2. Permanently disabled or requiring immediate in-patient hospitalisation.



         Principle 7. Auditors
         “The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”

         Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the market
         with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.

         The Audit and Risk Committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit
         process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk committee:
           • Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and

           • Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.

         Following 16 years of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as Seeka's auditor, as good corporate governance the Board released a formal request for
         proposal for the Group's auditing service. Overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee, on 29 August 2023, the Board appointed Grant Thornton as
         Seeka's auditor, and accepted the immediate resignation of PwC.

         Grant Thornton has confirmed its independence to the Audit and Risk Committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the
         reporting period. Grant Thornton auditors will attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.

         In FY23, $521,972 was paid or accrued to the external auditors; $425,631 to Grant Thornton ($367,500 for FY23 audit fees, $53,131 for
         disbursements, $5,000 for debt covenant compliance certificate agreed upon procedures), and $96,341 to the outgoing auditor PwC ($16,070 for
         additional FY22 audit fees, $47,967 for ISA 315 review, $11,874 business combination review, $6,930 for debt covenant compliance certificate agreed
         upon procedures, and $13,500 for half year agreed upon procedures).

         Internal audit
         Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
         includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
         external audit findings.

         Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated internal audit function, Seeka uses its assurance and compliance team to
         conduct internal audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s
         financial systems. Directors also consider matters raised by the external auditor.



         Principle 8. Shareholder Rights and Relations
         “The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
         the issuer.”

         Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
         open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of "founded on relationships".

         The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
           • Annual and interim reports
           • Annual sustainability report
           • Market announcements
           • Annual shareholder meeting
           • October stakeholder meeting
           • Ad-hoc investor presentations
           • Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type
           • Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors
           • Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and stakeholder update either in person or online, where they can
raise matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which affect Seeka at the annual shareholder
meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the company’s external auditor on a one
share, one vote principle.

Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar
Link Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. Notices of shareholder meetings are posted on the NZX website and Seeka's website. Where
circumstances allow, Seeka sends notices of shareholder meetings at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements
can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.

When raising new capital, where practical, the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company on a pro
rata basis so they can maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.

Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK.

         was reviewed and would not have significantly changed the employee remuneration disclosure.
