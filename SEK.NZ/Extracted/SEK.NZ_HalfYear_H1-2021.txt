                                           Packing Hayward kiwifruit at Seeka Katikati.
   FROM THE CHAIR AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

   Seeka is pleased to present its financial results and commentary for the six months ended 30 June 2021. Despite
   challenging operating conditions with labour shortages, market and shipping disruptions, Seeka delivered outstanding
   customer service and excellent financial results to shareholders.

   The company delivered on its strategy to improve earnings while delivering operational excellence, registering multiple
   highlights across the business in the six months to June. This included the purchase of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage
   Limited (OPAC) on 4 May, and in July announced a minority stake in the high-tech orchard-focussed start up Fruitometry.

   As OPAC was purchased mid-season and had already earned 85% of its full-year EBITDA prior to takeover, Seeka will
   incur the operating overheads for the remainder of 2021. From next year, these earnings will be recorded in Seeka’s Group
   financial statements. The business is now integrated, operating and cost structures reset, and synergy savings are on
   target. Acquisition and restructuring costs are included in this interim result.

   Seeka announced capacity upgrades to handle the near-term increase in kiwifruit volumes. The proposed new packhouse
   build at Pukenga has been delayed in favour of installing a new packing machine at KKP and high-efficiency coolstores at
   Transcool. The impairment costs associated with removing the old packline and coolstores are included in this result.

   Seeka progressed its sustainability programme with the assessment and independent verification of our 2019 carbon
   footprint. Using this information, initiatives are underway to reduce Seeka’s environmental impact and assess the
   risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Details on Seeka's carbon footprint plan are included in the
   document's sustainability report along with an overview of Seeka’s 2019 carbon footprint. Sustainability updates will be a
   focus of future stakeholder reporting.

   Seeka reminds stakeholders that it operates in a seasonal industry with substantial earnings occurring in the first six
   months as fruit is harvested in New Zealand and Australia.

   Results for the six months ended 30 June 2021
   Key financial components of the six months include:

   –   $224.5m revenue (previous corresponding period to June 2020 (pcp): $178.7m); up 26%.

       At 30 June Seeka had temporarily advanced $23.0m to Seeka Growers Limited (pcp: $21.1m).

   –   $1.4m one-off costs from the OPAC acquisition and restructure.

   New Zealand orchard operations
   Orchard operations span south from Northland through the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and to the East Coast, and
   includes growing kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry on leased, long term leased, and Seeka-owned orchards. The OPAC
   acquisition expands Seeka’s orcharding capability in Ōpōtiki and the East Coast and extends Seeka into the Gisborne
   region. The orcharding business also provides comprehensive orchard and vine management services to owners and
   develops orchards for landowners under long-term leases and in partnership with iwi.

   The Seeka business (excluding OPAC) grew 14.4m trays of kiwifruit compared to 13.0m trays in the pcp. In addition,
   OPAC’s orchard management team produced 3.7m trays for a combined production of 18.1m trays. Seeka is the largest
   kiwifruit grower in New Zealand.

   The growing season was good, and the previous drought-affected regions benefited from rain through key growing
   periods. Hayward yields recovered to average 12,302 trays per hectare, compared against 2020’s drought-impacted
   10,200 trays, and a five-year average of 10,800 trays per hectare. This recovery in Hayward yield is pleasing.

   Seeka also grew 1,394,000 kilograms of avocado for the 2020/21 season, (pcp: 1,614,000 kgs) and 140,000 kilograms of
   kiwiberry for harvest 2021 (pcp: 171,750 kgs).

   Orchard operations revenue for the six months of $53.7m is up $6.3m from the pcp, reflecting higher yields and excellent
   avocado and kiwiberry returns. $5.7m EBITDA for the period is up 36% on the pcp's $4.2m.

   Our strategy is to continue to invest in long term leases to secure supply. Fruit volumes from orchard operations are
   expected to increase as these orchards reach maturity.

    New Zealand post harvest operations
    Post harvest operates nine major facilities spread throughout the North Island’s major kiwifruit regions, following
    the addition of the OPAC facility. These dedicated and modern packhouses handle all produce from our orcharding
    operations and from independent growers.

    In 2021, Seeka packed 36.8m trays of kiwifruit (pcp: 33.4m) with OPAC packing another 8m trays (pcp 7.4m). Kiwifruit
    volumes recovered from droughts in 2019 and 2020. Seeka also packed 88,000 trays of kiwiberry, contract packed citrus
    in Kerikeri, and packed 262,000 trays of avocado from the 2020/21 avocado season.

    Post harvest revenue of $145.2m is up 34% from the pcp’s $108.1m due to volume and price increases. The cost of labour
    once again increased as post-harvest companies sought to attract scarce labour and RSE worker costs increased with
    MIQ costs. $49.1m EBITDA for the period is up $18.8m from the pcp’s $30.3m.

    New Zealand SeekaFresh retail services operations
    SeekaFresh includes the supply, export and sale of avocado, kiwiberry and class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, export sales of
    New Zealand kiwifruit through a collaborative programme, operation of our New Zealand wholesale marketing business
    including imported tropical fruits, and the manufacture and sale of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.

    Revenue increased 18% to $11.5m. EBITDA of $1.9m is up on the pcp’s $1.3m. The business benefited from a strong close
    to the 2020/21 avocado selling season.

    Momentum continues to build with vibrant leadership, dedicated staff, great customer relationships and high-quality
    produce.

    Australia operations
    Seeka Australia Pty Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned company, leases, operates and continues to develop kiwifruit
    orchards, and owns and operates nashi and pear orchards along with associated post harvest facilities in Victoria, directly
    marketing Seeka’s Australian produce domestically and to export customers.

    Seeka’s Australian business was impacted by Covid-19. Operations adapted with local management delivering excellent
    results in the circumstances. Labour is very short, and there are ongoing market disruptions and lockdowns.

    The tremendous job done by the Australian team delivered profit growth that exceeded the new orchard lease costs.
    Innovative management of orchard labour and post-harvest automation delivered our customers excellent service and
    quality produce, despite the disruptions.

    Total revenue for the six months of $13.9m compares against pcp of $13.3m. EBITDA of $2.7m compares to pcp of $1.9m,
    with EBIT of $1.4m in line with pcp’s $1.4m.

   Avocados and kiwiberry positive highlights
   Seeka continues to build its emerging avocado and kiwiberry categories; they positively contribute to Seeka’s earnings
   while delivering competitive returns to growers.

   The 2020/21 avocado season had an excellent finish with 262,000 trays handled and sold since 1 January to the export
   and local markets, delivering strong returns to Seeka’s supplying growers. The 2021/22 avocado season, however,
   appears soft with a glut of avocados and low export market values dampening the industry’s 2021/22 outlook.

   88,000 trays (1.6 kgs per tray) of kiwiberry were successfully harvested and marketed in collaboration with Freshmax or
   directly by SeekaFresh. Grower OGRs averaged $200,000 per hectare with the highest more than $270,000 per hectare.

   Automation, technology and capacity
   Seeka undertook multiple automation trials throughout the season to test labour-saving technologies and better
   understand design performance, particularly as we consider a new packhouse build. Options include packaging
   enhancements and automated box filling, with the business testing new scanning technology at Katikati which reduced
   manual grading. This was particularly successful.

   On-orchard innovation continues to ramp up. In July, Seeka took a stake in digital start-up Fruitometry. Using smart
   orchard scanning technology, Fruitometry provides valuable information to improve orchard management and post harvest
   planning. This investment is a part of Seeka’s commitment to develop and deploy technology that improves operational
   efficiency and decision making.

   Construction of a new packhouse on the Pukenga orchard adjacent to Seeka 360 continues to be evaluated. Before
   committing to this large investment, Seeka must be confident that automation will deliver operational efficiencies and
   cost savings, and have certainty about pack plans, the packhouse’s financial viability, and the availability to ship on time,
   including the option to deliver kiwifruit free on truck in the market. Currently we lack sufficient confidence to proceed with
   this investment.

   Kiwifruit volumes are increasing faster than previously anticipated. Our disciplined capacity planning indicates that Seeka's
   facilities will be capacity constrained next season. We responded with a $20m investment to replace KKP's old grader with
   an automated high-efficiency machine and replace Transcool's old coolstores with high-efficiency stores. To be completed
   prior to harvest 2022, these developments are expected to balance Seeka’s post harvest capacity through to 2024.

    Labour
    Labour is an ongoing challenge for primary producers and exporters throughout New Zealand and Australia. Severe
    labour shortages during peak demand are common. During peak picking and packing, skilled orchard and packhouse
    workers were extremely short.

    Seeka acted by collaborating with iwi and government agencies to get more locals into jobs. One example is a Northland
    joint initiative with Ngāti Hine and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to induct and train locals to become
    employment ready for the horticulture industry with career prospects. This initiative was successful.

    Seeka worked positively with MSD to facilitate regional workers by providing transport to Seeka facilities. Workers at
    Seeka are paid competitive remuneration and are provided with great working conditions. We have on-site gyms for staff
    at Kerikeri and Seeka 360 with a wellness programme about to be added.

    Seeka worked and paid public holidays.

    Local workers were complemented with access to overseas workers through the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE)
    scheme. Costing $1.9m, Seeka added 300 RSE workers from the government’s 2000 RSE access quota. These people
    provided pivotal labour, particularly early harvest and at its peak. Despite these initiatives, Seeka was short of workers
    at critical times. There were simply no more people to employ. As a result, many of our people worked longer and much
    harder to get the job done; performance we are grateful for.

    Health and safety
    Labour shortages exacerbated the safety risk profile. People worked harder to cover the labour shortfall. Seeka took all
    efforts to keep our people safe and continues to invest in safety. More barriers, more guarding, more focus on removing
    the chance of collision between humans and mobile plant, and more focus on our safety management and planning.
    There were no serious harm incidents at Seeka and less lost time injuries than the pcp.

    Safety initiatives include trialling new technology that alerts forklift drivers when people are near. This follows two serious
    harm incidents last year that drove us to search for a solution to forklift incidents.

    Seeka introduced lead indicators to our safety performance measures. Recording safety meetings and attendees across
    the Group, this new Inspirational People measure is helping instil a company-wide safety culture.

   Strategic highlights
   The company concentrated on operational excellence undertaking disciplined planning to prepare for the harvest, and to
   ensure that each operation was well executed with full consideration for capacity, people, safety and financial outcomes,
   including contingency planning. Seeka continues to trial and implement automation technologies that improve efficiency
   and fruit quality while redeploying labour. We also focus on supply chain efficiencies where we deliver an integrated
   service right through to the market or customer.

   Seeka continued to focus on strategic opportunities for profitable growth, acquiring OPAC in the period which secured
   new volumes from the Ōpōtiki, East Coast and Gisborne regions. The acquisition is complete, integrated and synergy
   targets achieved. Growth remains an important platform in Seeka’s strategy.

   Seeka continued to enhance our core kiwifruit capabilities as we strengthened the balance sheet, maintained financial
   capability to invest and delivered earnings growth and share value appreciation to shareholders. The company continues
   to concentrate on its foundation through disciplined planning.

   Seeka progressed our sustainability initiatives, completing a full audit of our greenhouse gas emissions that details our
   2019 CO2e footprint as we grow, handle and supply New Zealand and Australian fruit to domestic and international
   consumers. We identified key contributors, categorised our emissions to industry standards, and defined performance
   baselines from which we can set reduction targets and measure efficiency gains. Independently verified by Toitū
   Envirocare, an overview of Seeka’s GHG Emissions Inventory Report 2019 can be seen on page 12.

   The Seeka team
   Seeka’s people have again excelled under the pressures of harvest across New Zealand and Australia. They adapted,
   innovated and strived to deliver an excellent first half result. During the harvest period, the team integrated OPAC and
   inducted all continuing staff.

   Seeka continued to develop its people and foster talent with 18 new cadets hired in 2021.

   Faced with severe labour shortages, Seeka worked with iwi and government agencies, including MSD, to maximise the
   employment of local workers.

   Our people continue to make Seeka an inspiring produce company to work for and are celebrated for their efforts.

     Dividend
     A dividend of $0.13 per share will be paid 13 October 2021 to all shareholders on the register at 5pm on 20 September
     2021. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply.

     Full year operational guidance
     Seeka has substantially improved operational earnings in the period. Full-year net profit before tax (NPBT) is forecast to
     be between $13.5m and $16.0m. This includes $1.4m of restructuring and acquisition costs, and excludes any one-off
     gains or extraordinary items (should they settle in the year) and $1.8m of OPAC profit to the acquisition date (NPBT).
     Note that $9m of pcp NPBT was from a gain on orchard sales.

                                                                           2021 guidance         2021 guidance               2020

     Full year guidance
     Further to the full year operational guidance of net profit before tax, Seeka expects a one-off extraordinary gain from the
     successful settlement of the kiwifruit claim against the Crown. The actual amount to be received by Seeka is unknown
     with the distribution subject to High Court approval, with the timing of payment expected to be received before the end of
     2021. Seeka is estimating that its share of the distribution could lift the net profit before tax for the 2021 year to between
     $20.0m and $22.0m.

                                                                           2021 guidance         2021 guidance               2020

     Summary
     We are proud of how the company performed in challenging circumstances with labour shortages, shipping disruptions
     and ongoing market uncertainty from Covid-19.

     Seeka continues to make excellent progress with its sustainability initiatives, including the calculation and independent
     verification of Seeka’s 2019 base year carbon footprint. Work in this important area continues.

     Seeka has improved first half profitability, increased dividends and completed a significant acquisition. We are ready and
     prepared to continue our growth journey knowing that we must continue to lift base profitability.

     We thank all growers, shareholders, employees and stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willingly give to Seeka.

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standardised meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar
financial information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both
investors and management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expense
associated with debt (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large investments in
fixed and leased assets (EBITDA).

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

Accounting policies
As part of the OPAC acquisition four types of revenue contracts were acquired. Two post harvest contracts are similar in nature to Seeka’s packing
and cool storage contracts, with the exception of the timing of the cool storage revenue recognition which is accounted for as fruit is packed rather
than loaded out. There were also two orchard management contracts for managing fruit growing and to collect the supply of fruit, which is similar
in nature to Seeka’s existing contracts, see note 13.

Northland orchards
At 30 June 2021, 23 hectares of Northland orchards (June 2020 - 34 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. These properties
were part of the 2018 purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited. Growing costs were not attributed to these orchards as they are
valued on a crop-off basis.
The assets are classified as held for sale as their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition was met when the sale became highly probable and the assets were available for immediate sale in their present
condition. The Group is committed to the sale and expects the sale to be completed within one year from the date of classification. These assets
are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell as required by NZ IFRS 5.
The accounting standards allow for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control.
Management considers the remaining Northland orchards meet the requirements to extend past 12 months as there is current interest in the
properties with sales contracts expected in the next 12 months.


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group used judgement to recognise the remaining Northland orchards as held for sale, despite being classified as held for sale for more than
12 months. The Group used judgement to classify the Australian sale and leaseback as an asset held for sale and estimates to calculate lease
balances, the gain on sale and the discount rate to apply to the lease.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
appropriate asset class. At 30 June 2021, assets under construction are largely related to the Kerikeri coolstore build.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus any
subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by Telfer Young Valuers,
ANZIV, independent registered valuer.
In Australia valuations are undertaken by Preston Rowe Paterson Shepparton (previously known as Goulburn Valley Property Services),
independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. All Australian land and buildings were last revalued at 31 December 2019.
As at 30 June 2021 the directors believe there are no indicators that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings differs materially
from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue those assets at 30 June 2021. As part of the OPAC acquisition, OPAC land
and buildings were independently valued by Telfer Young Valuers, see note 13.
Impairment
In the six months to June 2021, $1.13m of assets were impaired. This included $0.75m for old Transcool coolstores that were removed to make
room for new coolstore builds prior to harvest 2022, $0.22m for an old grader at KKP that is being replaced by a new MAF Roda grader for harvest
2022, and $0.16m related to VLS laboratory costs.


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 30 June 2021 an assessment of the carrying values of land and buildings was performed. Based on discussions with experts in property
valuation, the value of Seeka’s property has not materially changed in the last six months. Property valuations remain high for properties in the
food production industry. On the OPAC acquisition land and buildings were valued by an independent valuer, Telfer Young, which confirmed that
the capitalisation rates and market rents for industrial properties remain strong.
Seeka’s Australian properties are also located in the food production region of Victoria which supports the carrying values of the remaining land
and buildings.
Sensitivity analysis suggests property values have overall increased between $0m and $1m. This is not considered a material movement in land
and building values.

Goodwill
The Board reviews business performance based on operating segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level. Goodwill represents
the 2021 acquisition of OPAC, see note 13, the 2019 acquisition of the Aongatete business, the 2018 acquisition of the Northland business, the
previously-acquired Glassfields business (now named SeekaFresh) and the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges.
The following table details the carrying amount of goodwill from acquired operations.

Additions
On 15 December 2020, the Group completed a sale and leaseback transaction for three kiwifruit orchards totalling 199 hectares in Australia. The
completion of this sale created a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability, with the difference between the two recognised as a gain on sale
through the statement of financial performance
On 4 May 2021, the Group acquired OPAC, which included $0.55m of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities, see note 13.


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The valuation of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities uses judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rate and the
likelihood of exercising any rights of renewal to extend the lease term.

Current trade receivables include temporary advances to Seeka kiwifruit grower pools of $23.00m (Jun 2020 - $21.14m). This increase represents
a higher pack deferral value in 2021, which attracts a higher advance amount, plus $1.06m from similar temporary advances to OPAC grower
pools, see note 13. The temporary advances will be fully repaid by December 2021.
Accrued income and other sundry receivables includes $21.27m (Jun 2020 - $19.64m) of income for kiwifruit harvested and delivered to Zespri
from Seeka's New Zealand orchards, $14.07m (Jun 2020 - $18.62m) for New Zealand post harvest operations, $14.96m from similar OPAC
operations, see note 13, and $4.68m (Jun 2020 - $4.29m) of income for kiwifruit and pears harvested in Australia.
Non current prepayments in June 2020 relate to avocado plants ordered and prepaid, but not expected to be delivered for more than 12 months.
Income from the New Zealand kiwifruit is accrued based on forecast information prepared by the Group, being an average Hayward HW orchard
gate return (OGR) of $6.52 per tray (Jun 2020 -$6.00: Dec 2020 - $7.56) and an average SunGold G3 OGR of $12.05 per tray (Jun 2020 - $11.37:
Dec 2020 - $12.63).


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group has reviewed trade and other receivables for any debtor impairment, credit risk, or any other such risks that may result in non-
payment. The Group has not identified any circumstances where further provisioning or impairment of financial instruments is required.

Fruit inventories relate to kiwifruit harvested from New Zealand and Australian orchards and held in coolstores at balance date. As at 30 June
2021, 57.1% (Jun 2020 - 58.6%) of New Zealand class 1 trays have been loaded out. New Zealand kiwifruit inventory is valued at a Green HW
OGR of $6.52 per tray and a SunGold G3 OGR of $12.05 per tray. Fruit inventory from fruit harvested from the Group’s Australian orchards is
based on actual and forecast market returns for each variety.
At balance date, $29.79m (June 2020 - $27.30m ) of packaging inventory costs were expensed to cost of sales in the statement of financial
performance. There were no material inventory write downs (Jun 2020 - Nil).


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group has reviewed inventory for any risks occurring as a result of Covid-19, and whether additional provisioning or write-offs are required.
The Group considers all inventory will be able to be used in the normal course of business.

13. Business combination
Amalgamation of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited (OPAC)
During the year the Group acquired Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited (OPAC), a kiwifruit post harvest and orcharding business based in
Ōpōtiki, the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, into a newly-formed 100% owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Seeka OPAC Limited. OPAC shares
were cancelled and re-issued for shares in Seeka Limited at a ratio of 1.4833 shares in Seeka for each share in OPAC, based on a price of $4.82 per
Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 24 March 2021, with all fractions of Seeka shares rounded
up to the next whole number). The purchase was settled 4 May 2021 for a recorded consideration of $38.73m when Seeka issued 7,042,574
ordinary shares at $5.50, being the share market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3. The change in share price between the VWAP and
the share price on acquisition date had the impact of increasing goodwill by $4.80m.
On acquisition, the Group drew down a $27m loan to repay the acquired interest bearing liabilities of $21.86m, with the remainder used to service
OPAC's working capital requirements for the remainder of the season.
OPAC contributed $12.47m of revenue and $2.86m of net profit before tax to the Group for the period from 4 May to 30 June 2021. If the
acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021, OPAC would have contributed $19.13m of revenue and $4.66m of net profit before tax for the six
months ended 30 June 2021. These calculations are not significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies between the Group and the
acquired subsidiary, and no significant additional depreciation would have been charged if fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment
had applied from 1 January 2021, including consequential tax effects.
The following table details the fair values of OPAC assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

The fair value of acquired trade receivables is $0.40m. There was no loss allowance recognised on acquisition. The goodwill of $9.73m is allocated
to the Bay of Plenty post harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of the amalgamation was to obtain the post harvest facility and
associated grower relationships. The goodwill is attributable to the operation’s strong market position in the Ōpōtiki, East Cape and Gisborne
regions, and synergies expected to arise from adding an extra post harvest facility to the Seeka Group. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible
for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs of $0.47m are included in administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $1.86m was provided in relation to differences
between tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets. Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition to reassess the disclosed fair values
of assets and liabilities. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the acquisition date.



Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The fair values of assets are subject to estimates and judgement. Seeka engaged Telfer Young to complete an independent valuation of the land
and buildings at the acquisition date. The remaining property, plant and equipment was assessed on a depreciated historical cost basis, as well as a
physical stocktake and a comparison to similar Seeka-owned assets. The Group assessed that an intangible asset exists for grower relationships and
contracts, which is immaterial for financial reporting using the multi-period excess earnings method of calculating intangible assets on contracts.



Dividends, share capital and fair value
This section focuses on how the Group pays dividends to grow shareholder returns, manages its share capital, and determines the fair
value of its financial assets, securities and liabilities so it can deliver benefits to stakeholders.
Disclosures are made on the Group’s bank facilities, retained earnings, dividends paid to shareholders, and earnings per share. Details on the
Company’s share capital include shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan, grower incentive and employee share schemes.

16. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table analyses financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as at 30 June 2021.
The different levels are defined as:
– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
  Instruments in level 1 are comprised of water shares and irrigation water rights.
– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
  when determining an appropriate price.

the Psa outbreak in 2010. The settlement sum for the legal, funding and claimants is $40m inclusive of GST if any. Seeka is a plaintiff in the class
action. Seeka expects a one-off extraordinary gain from the successful settlement of the kiwifruit claim against the Crown. The actual amount to
be received by Seeka is unknown with the distribution subject to High Court approval, with the timing of payment expected to be received before
the end of 2021. Seeka estimates that its share of the distribution could be between $4.0m and $8.5m.

20. Events occurring after balance date
On 9 July 2021, Seeka announced an equity investment in Fruitometry, an innovative horticultural startup. Fruitometry provides knowledge to
efficiently manage orchards, maximise yields and provide accurate pre-harvest fruit estimates for the supply chain. Seeka's minority investment of
$2.60m values Fruitometry at $10 million. Fruitometry will continue to operate independently while expanding their service.
A dividend was declared for $0.13 per share to be paid on 13 October 2021, see note 14.
There are no other events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.
