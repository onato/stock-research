Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group’s operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and services
provided to external customers during the period. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction and disposals
of assets including the disposal of those assets damaged by the Oakside fire – see note 3). Subsequent additions are at cost. In New Zealand
valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers, ANZIV, independent registered valuer. In Australia valuations are undertaken by Goulburn
Valley Property Services, independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia.
At the half year balance date the Directors believe that the carrying value of land and building assets (excluding assets under construction) does
not differ materially from its fair value, and therefore the assets have not been revalued at this half year balance date.

Note 14. Share Capital
At 31 December 2015 an employee share trust established in 2002 to administer an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan was in the
process of being wound up by the scheme’s trustees. During the six month period to 30 June 2016 the trustees sold all 242,000 surplus shares
and repaid to Seeka the outstanding loan of $0.73m in relation to those shares.
Those shares have now been classified as paid up capital in the statement of financial performance and also classified as an issue of shares within
funding activities in the statement of cash flows.
An additional $0.17m was received during the period in relation to shares issued under the employee share scheme established in 2014.

          Note 15. Determination of fair values
          Fair value of financial assets
          The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
          The different levels are defined as:
           • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
             Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited.
           • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
           • Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
             when determining an appropriate price.

                                                                                              Level 1              Level 2               Level 3                 Total

Note 16. Related party transactions
The Group undertakes transactions with Seeka Growers Limited (SGL), a related party which administers all kiwifruit revenues received for the New
Zealand business on behalf of supplying growers. In the current period the Group received $57.64m (Dec 2015 - $104.83m) for the provision of
services to SGL.



Note 17. Events occurring after balance date
There are no events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.


Note 18. Restatement of prior period
For the six month period to 30 June 2015, revenue and cost of sales have been restated to appropriately recognise banana sales made as an
agent. This reduced revenue and cost of sales by $7.90m leaving gross profit unchanged.
Restatement is not required of the audited 31 December 2015 or 31 December 2014 financial statements.
There is no impact on reported net profit attributable to equity holders for prior periods.
