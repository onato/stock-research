FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

Seeka is pleased to provide you with this report on our unaudited financial and operational results for the six months ended
30 June 2019. In the period, Seeka focussed on achieving excellence through its growth strategy, including consolidating the
Northland orcharding and post harvest operations and purchasing Aongatete Coolstores Limited (Aongatete) to add additional
kiwifruit volume and processing capacity to our central Bay of Plenty catchment area as well as delivering excellent service to our
growers and marketers, principally Zespri.

Since the acquisition of the Northland kiwifruit orchards and related post harvest business from T&G Global Limited in 2018,
Seeka has invested $ 15.2m in a new packhouse and new packing technology to better service our expanding Northland grower
base, and is progressively selling the kiwifruit orchards to motivated investors who are committed to supplying their fruit to our
operations. Our new and improved Northland post harvest facilities and subsequent orchard resales are delivering a new level of
service to this growing region and securing ongoing supply to our post harvest operations. The cash flow from the orchard sales
has allowed the repayment of debt.

In March 2019, Seeka expanded kiwifruit operations with the acquisition of Aongatete. An innovative company with excellent
people and loyal growers, Aongatete was a strategic acquisition in our Bay of Plenty heartland to build kiwifruit volume and
deliver packing and storage capacity to our core kiwifruit business.

This summer’s dry growing conditions reduced volumes across the Australasian produce sector, including kiwifruit. While our
orcharding yields and post harvest volumes were impacted by this seasonal drop, Seeka has delivered a 28% lift in net profit after
tax to $11.86m; up from $9.32m in the previous corresponding period (pcp). Seeka maintains its full year EBITDA guidance of
$32.5m to $33.5m.

The new NZ IFRS16 lease accounting standard was fully implemented in the period with pcp comparatives restated to ensure
comparability of our financial results for the half year. This accounting standard changes the reporting of lease expense along
with interest and depreciation.

Seeka is a seasonal business, earning significantly more income in the first six-months and the financial performance of the
Company in the first six-months may not reflect the full year earnings.

Seeka remains focussed on consolidating operations from the Northland and Aongatete acquisitions, including completing the
sale of Northland orchards to repay debt, while securing supply to our core kiwifruit business. This process is currently being
extended to Australia where Seeka is investigating the potential to sell and leaseback the Australian kiwifruit orchards and since
balance date has advertised for sale the Australian kiwifruit orchard portfolio. This would secure supply to our Australian post
harvest and retail operations, realise a cash gain for the business, provide funds to accelerate growth and reduce Seeka’s debt.

   for a further $3.1m gain.

–– All of the shares in Aongatete Coolstores limited were acquired for $14m.

–– $15.2m 1 investment in new packhouse and pack machine at Kerikeri; commissioned for harvest 2019, this large infrastructure
   build delivers capacity ahead of Northland’s growing kiwifruit and avocado production.

   approximately 2.25m trays , delivering greater efficiency and providing our growers the ability to harvest at the optimal time
   for fruit quality lowering the risk of late harvest to our growers.

–– Successful harvest and processing operations across New Zealand and Australia including kiwifruit, avocados, kiwiberry,
   nashi and pears.

–– 33.5m tray equivalents of kiwifruit packed by New Zealand post harvest (pcp: 31.1m); 29.6m from Seeka’s traditional post
   harvest operation (5% down on a seasonal drop in Hayward yields), plus 3.9m trays from the 2019 Aongatete acquisition.

–– Grower loyalty share scheme secures New Zealand kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry supply for three seasons; 2,061,803
   shares allotted with an estimated 91% of growers are now Seeka shareholders.

–– Rewarding employee engagement with a new employee share scheme; 568,000 shares allotted with an estimated 70% of
   permanent employees are now Seeka shareholders.

–– One serious harm injury to a packer’s finger at Aongatete post harvest.

–– New Seeka App gives growers online updates on their crop’s performance in Seeka’s supply chain.

Dividend announcement
A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 9 October 2019 to
those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 13 September 2019. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount
applied to determine the strike price.

Outlook
Seeka is anticipating lower operational earnings for the second half of the financial year reflecting lower volumes of fruit in store
at 30 June and an early selling season. The company continues to market, negotiate and sell Northland orchards and has started
enacting a similar strategy in Australia. When completed these sales are expected to reduce debt and realise a gain on sale. The
following guidance is based on Seeka’s best estimate on the forward six months’ earnings. The market will be updated if there is
material deviation.

Review of operations
Financial performance

Revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2019 increased 16.8% to $169.87m (pcp: $145.44m). Consolidated earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $27.91m (pcp: $25.71m); up 8.6%. This includes an $0.15m EBITDA
loss from Seeka Australia (pcp: $2.71m gain), from a very dry summer resulting in lower Hayward kiwifruit volumes and an
underperforming nashi programme.

Consolidated profit after tax was up 27.3% to $11.86m (pcp: $9.32m), with cash flow from operations up 107% to $5.15m (pcp:
$2.49m).

In the period, Seeka invested $25.82m in property plant and equipment, primarily building the Kerikeri pack house and
commissioning a new packing machine and upgrading Oakside packing machine 2, pre-coolers and coolstores. Once additional
pre-cooler and coolstore builds at Kerikeri are completed, Seeka’s post harvest capacity is forecast to be able to handle fruit
supply for the next two seasons.

In the six months, $7.13m was realised from completed Northland property sales (of which $1.73m relates to a sale recorded
in 2018), with $5.4m of orchard sales made in the period for a gain of $1.2m. Since 30 June 2019, Seeka completed a further
$11.71m of orchard sales to realise a $1.5m gain and has $7.0m of conditional sales expected to settle before year end which will
realise a further $1.6m gain.

Seeka holds a further $21.65m in orchards at fair value. These are expected to be substantially sold this financial year with the
sale proceeds returning debt to more conservative levels.

Net debt at 30 June (bank loans less bank deposits) was $148.08m (pcp: $115.98m); an increase of $32.1m, driven by the
investment in post harvest capacity and the Aongatete acquisition.

New Zealand operations

Orcharding

Spanning from Northland through to the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast, orcharding production covers the
growing of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry on leased, long term leased, and Seeka-owned orchards. Orcharding also provides
comprehensive orchard management and vine management services to orchard owners.

Orcharding kiwifruit volumes increased in 2019 from new production associated with the Northland and Aongatete acquisitions,
with the company growing 41.11m kilograms of kiwifruit (11.42m trays) compared to the prior year’s 37.44m kilograms (10.4m
trays). The acquired orchards helped offset the drop in Hayward yields to 9,800 trays per hectare (pcp: 11,800 trays per hectare),
which was primarily due to a hot summer restricting fruit size and increasing reject rates, mainly from sooty mould contamination.
Hayward yields have now fluctuated over the last three seasons, with this variety showing signs of biennial bearing.

Seeka also grew 732,000 kilograms of avocados (pcp: 200,000 kgs) and 64,400 kilograms of kiwiberry (pcp: 15,000 kgs).

Orchard operations revenue of $48.33m is up $9.34m from the pcp, while EBITDA of $4.16m is in line with the prior period,
reflecting a reduction in the productive orchard area under long term lease. Seeka continues to invest in long term lease
arrangements with fruit volumes set to increase as these orchards reach maturity.

Post harvest

Post harvest operates eight major facilities spread throughout the major growing regions in the North Island handling all produce
from our orcharding operations and from our independent growers.

In the period, 33.5m trays of kiwifruit were packed (pcp: 31.1m), with 3.9m trays supplied by growers associated with our new
Aongatete acqusition completed 18 March.

Total post harvest volumes were impacted by the dry summer, with Hayward yields from Seeka’s traditional supplying growers
down 17% on the prior period. Felt across the industry, this significant drop in Hayward production reduced product flow to
Seeka’s post harvest operations, and tempered the positive impact Aongatete has delivered to our core post harvest business.

The company had the capacity, systems and personnel to deliver a timely harvest to our grower clients. Coolstorage fruit loss, a
key measure of performance for our growers, has remained low. The following table shows week 30 fruit loss (to 28 July).

Aongatete is being progressively integrated into Seeka with significant synergies to be realised from 2020 onwards.

Post harvest revenue of $105.29m increased 19% on the pcp ($88.58m). Post harvest costs are up across our industry, driven by
higher wage rates and the ongoing focus on health and safety. EBITDA of $29.82m compares with $23.24m in the pcp.

Retail services

Includes the supply and sale of avocados and class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, sale of New Zealand kiwifruit through collaborative
programmes, handling of imported tropical fruits, and the manufacture and sale of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.

EBITDA of $0.76m is down from $1.06m in the prior period due to a reduced kiwiberry harvest (in line with lower Hayward
yields), lower avocado volumes with more fruit having been picked prior to 1 January, and challenging avocado supply lines due to
changes to the phytosanitary certification processes, particularly to Australia. The retail services business has stabilised.

Australia operations

Seeka Australia PTY Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned entity, owns and operates kiwifruit, nashi and pear orchards along with
associated post harvest facilities in Victoria, and directly markets Seeka produce to retailers.

Kiwifruit yields were again down following a very hot and dry summer which impacted fruit size; kiwifruit remain profitable, albeit
at lower levels. The green nashi sales programme delivered a loss. Volumes and planted areas have been reset to match the crop
to profitable market opportunities.

Seeka is positive about its Australian investment and its Australian orchard portfolio, and is confident that its proposed strategy
to sell and leaseback its kiwifruit orchards will realise a gain that will be used to repay debt.

Seeka continues to test the production and marketing of new kiwifruit and licenced pear varieties on its Australian orchards, and
has 70 hectares of kiwifruit and 26 hectares of pears in development which will add to production from 2020 onwards.

The detection of Psa in Australia has not created issues in our mature Hayward kiwifruit orchards and the company continues to
monitor its development orchards.

Across all varieties Seeka is concentrating on quality and increasing yields.

EBITDA loss of $0.15m (pcp : $2.70m gain) was a result of lower yields and an under-performing green nashi programme.

Seeka’s Australian operations are an important investment in extending our geographical reach and product range and we will
continue to further develop the business, including upgrading existing and developing new orchards, and investing in water to
grow production. Yields per hectare and total volumes are expected to improve over the next three years as new plantings mature.




SEEKA LIMITED | INTERIM REPORT JUNE 2019                                                                                              7
Strategic highlights
Seeka continues to enact our strategy. Kiwifruit is our core product, with the company diversifying geographically and targeting
complementary produce categories. The focus is on growth that delivers accretive value to our stakeholders, including
shareholders, growers, employees, contractors and community. Our focus is on delivering our marketers, principally Zespri, the
highest quality fruit and delivering our growers great returns through our supply chain.

Seeka has excelled where it operates the entire value chain from the orchard to the customer and delivered incremental returns
to growers; as demonstrated by avocados and kiwiberry. Seeka delivers orchard-to-market excellence in New Zealand kiwifruit,
avocados, class 2 kiwifruit, and kiwiberry, along with Australian kiwifruit, nashi and European pears.

Seeka has focussed on consolidating its position, setting its management structures, and selling orchards with secure supply
contracts to reset debt while pursuing operational excellence.

During the six months, Seeka has expanded our core business through the Aongatete acquisition, and secured Northland
post harvest volumes while negotiating $24.11m of orchard sales. We are also progressing the sale of the remaining Northland
orchards currently held at the fair value of $21.65m.

Seeka is also now marketing its Australian kiwifruit orchard portfolio to test if the same outcomes can be obtained in Australia.

Market conditions for Australian-grown produce are good and the fruit is of excellent quality, noting it is a completely different
growing environment. Kiwifruit production in Australia is set to double in the next five years. The planned sale and leaseback of
three kiwifruit orchards will help accelerate growth in this key market while repaying company debt.

The company has focussed on asset utilisation and capacity planning and has substantially built the infrastructure to handle
volume growth over the next two seasons. It has deliberately positioned itself in Northland to provide excellent service to the
region’s growth in avocados and kiwifruit, and has actively increased its avocado market share, including directly purchasing and
syndicating Far North orchards. This has delivered a benefit to investors and new volumes and market share to Seeka.

Health and safety
Seeka’s focus is on continuous improvement to ensure the health and safety of all personnel at all locations. All reported
incidents and near-misses are followed up within the company. A serious harm injury occurred during harvest 2019 when a
packer injured a finger at the Aongatete facility. Reviews and machine changes have been made across the company to ensure
this injury will not reoccur.

The total recordable injury frequency rate is above the annual 4.5 threshold and ahead of the pcp rate of 4.37. The company
continues to monitor, manage and take all reasonable steps to prevent workplace injuries.

The following table shows key safety measures to 30 June against annual thresholds.

1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of
   hours worked. TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
2. The severity rate measures the number of days lost per lost-time injury. Severity rate = (number of days lost) / (number of lost time injuries).

The Seeka team
Seeka’s people have excelled during the six months to 30 June 2019.

Seeka has continued to invest in its people to become the employer of choice in a tight labour market. The company has reset
minimum wages to new thresholds, and comprehensively reviewed all remuneration levels to ensure Seeka people are well
remunerated. Importantly, we have reviewed work hours, particularly in the early part of the season as the industry chases
premium early incentives on behalf of its growers.

Seeka continues to focus on talent development and has 12 cadets, with some now emerging as qualified orchard managers.
Wellness programmes continue to be implemented across the company.

Seeka continues to actively source New Zealand workers to fulfil peak seasonal labour demand and operates a parallel
recognised seasonal employer programme (RSE) that delivers focussed pastoral care for our overseas’ workers. Of our 3,500
strong seasonal workforce, Seeka recruited 970 overseas workers through the RSE scheme.

Seasonal labour continues to be a challenge, with the industry increasingly relying on overseas labour to complement the
available local workforce. Backpacker labour was in short supply, adding to employment pressure. This employment environment
pushed the industry to the limit. These circumstances increase the risk profile. Seeka continues to work on initiatives to keep our
people safe.

The company has gone to significant lengths to ensure contractors and subcontractors comply with labour, health and safety
legislation, and strive to achieve best practice. Seeka has a dedicated team that coaches, audits and undertakes gap analysis with
our contractor and subcontractor community to ensure we achieve better than just compliant.

Summary
Seeka continues to consolidate its operations following the Northland acquisition, whilst also seizing the opportunity to purchase
Aongatete; a reputable competitor in our region, operating in our core business with excellent people and loyal growers. The
company has made excellent progress selling the Northland orchards, secured supply from the region, and developed a world-
class post harvest facility in Kerikeri. Seeka is now pursuing a similar sale and potential leaseback strategy for orchards in
Australia.

Hayward kiwifruit yields were down on last season, and this impacted our profit in the period. However, the company is
benefiting from substantial cash gains realised by the ongoing sales of our Northland orchard portfolio.

Seeka expects 2019 full year EBITDA to be in the range of $32.5m to $33.5m, with debt lowered by year end.

We thank all growers, shareholders and stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willingly give to Seeka.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations
The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
 –– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
    whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
    orchard owners.

 –– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into produc-
    tive orchards, pays all development and production costs, owns all
    crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the landowner
    after all costs are recovered.

 –– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
    costs and receives all income in relation to the sale of the crops.

Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
citrus and berry industries. This includes all crops from the Group’s
orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from independent
orchard owners.




EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of
profitability and reflects operating cash flow generation (before lease costs).
EBIT (a non-GAAP measure) is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

   Turnover
   The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group’s operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and services
   provided to external customers during the period. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers where
   the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

   The gain on sale of assets held for sale is in relation to the Northland orchards, refer to notes 5 and 18.
   The Group’s major revenue streams are post harvest operations, orchard management, retail services and Australian operations.

   Post harvest
   All post harvest contracts are standardised. The Group enters into two types of post harvest contracts. The first type of post harvest contract has
   two performance obligations. One is to collect the supply of kiwifruit via picking and transportation. The second performance obligation is maturity
   testing, which is only provided as needed. The charges are separated in the contract. All the revenue is recognised at a point in time as the service is
   performed.
   The second type of contract has three performance obligations. These are to pack kiwifruit, to cool kiwifruit and to sell class 2 fruit to the local market.
   These are stand-alone services that Seeka provides. Each performance obligation has a separate transaction price detailed in the contract. Each of the
   performance obligations are recognised overtime as the service is performed. Packing revenue is recognised as the fruit is packed. Cooling revenue is
   recognised as the fruit is loaded out from cool storage. Class 2 fruit is recognised as the fruit is sold.

   Orchard management
   The orchard management contracts are largely standardised, with the occasional customisation being made as a contract is negotiated. There are
   two contracts that make up the orchard management services. The first is the Management Contract. This has one performance obligation, which is
   to manage the production of the fruit. Revenue is recognised over time as the service is performed, calculated as cost plus an agreed margin per the
   contract. The management fee that is included in the contract is recognised evenly over the 12 month period of the contract. An incentive fee is only
   recognised once the OGR is reached and when an incentive would be receivable.
   The second orchard management contract has one performance obligation, to collect the supply of kiwifruit. The transaction price is determined
   using a forecasted OGR. Revenue is recognised at a point in time, when the crops are picked (in the June half year accounts).

Retail services
The retail service contracts are customised to the service being offered (such as ripening or fruit sales). There are three types of contracts entered
into. The first contract has one performance obligation, to sell fruit on the owner’s behalf. For this contract, Seeka is an agent and only collects the
marketer’s commission and is recognised at a point in time when the fruit is sold.
The second type of contract comprises storage and ripening revenue. Both contain one performance obligation, to either store or ripen the fruit.
Revenue is recognised over the time as the fruit is being stored or ripened. The third contract is customised with each supplier. The essence of the
contracts remain the same. There is one performance obligation, to provide the product ordered. The transaction price is based on the agreed price
(either in writing or verbally) and recognised at a point in time when the invoice is raised.

Australia
Australian contracts are maintained by the Australian business. They are on a one-to-one basis with the fruit purchaser and are largely standardised.
There is one performance obligation, to provide the fruit to the customer. The transaction price is based on the agreed price (either in writing or
verbally) and recognised at a point in time.

Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations, with post harvest revenues recognised as services are provided and orcharding
revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New Zealand kiwifruit are harvested from March
to June, avocados from August to January, and kiwiberries from February to March. In Australia nashi and European pears are harvested January to
March, and kiwifruit from March to May. As a result of these harvest timings around 80% of orchard revenues are recognised in the first six months
of the financial year. The timing of the provision of post harvest services can vary from year to year. Normally 70% is recognised in the first six
months of the financial year, but seasonal fluctuations can alter this.

Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus any
subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers, ANZIV,
independent registered valuer. In Australia valuations are undertaken by Goulburn Valley Property Services, independent valuers, Shepparton,
Victoria, Australia.
As at 30 June 2019 the directors believe there are no indicators that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings differs materially
from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue those assets at 30 June 2019.

The goodwill addition of $6.6m was for the purchase of Aongatete Coolstores Limited on 18 March 2019, refer note 12. The remaining goodwill is
comprised of $5.9m for Seeka Australia, $1.2m for the purchase of assets in Kerikeri from T&G Global Limited, $0.5m for Glassfields, and $0.2m for
Kiwi Crush.
Other intangible assets are kiwifruit licences purchased from Zespri Limited on 1 May 2018. The licences were purchased with the intention of using
them on orchards that were still to be settled with T&G Global Limited at 31 December 2018. In June 2019 the orchards have settled to Seeka and
subsequently the licences have been reclassified to assets held for sale, see note 5, as at 30 June 2019.

At 30 June 2019, per NZ IAS 36, a review for impairment indicators was performed on goodwill. No impairment indicators were identified.

Accrued fruit and other sundry receivables includes $18.48m (Jun 2018 - $15.53m) of kiwifruit income for kiwifruit harvested and delivered to Zespri
from the Group’s New Zealand orchards and $16.95m (Jun 2018 - $13.22m) for post harvest operations in New Zealand.
Income from the New Zealand kiwifruit crop is accrued based on forecast information prepared by the Group, being an average Hayward HW orchard
gate return (OGR) of $6.00 per tray (Jun 2018: $5.49) and an average SunGold G3 OGR of $10.50 per tray (Jun 2018 - $10.06).
The Group applies the NZ IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade
receivables.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the
payment profiles of sales over a 12 month period before 30 June 2019 and the corresponding historical credit losses during this period, adjusted for
any significant known amounts that are not receivable. The provision for bad debts at 30 June 2019 is $0.50m (Dec 2018 - $0.50m).
Accrued fruit income of $13.82m in June 2018 has been reclassified to crop inventory, see note 10. This reflects the value of the crop that has not
been loaded out at balance date.

B. Purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited
During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group purchased Kerikeri-based kiwifruit orchards, packhouse facilities and related assets and
liabilities representing the kiwifruit business previously owned by T&G Global Limited. The transaction was completed in two stages. The first stage
was the purchase of the packhouse facilities and related assets on 30 April 2018. The second stage was the purchase of the orchards from 30 June
2018. One orchard remained subject to subdivision at 31 December 2018 and was settled in June 2019. This orchard remained at the risk of T&G
Global Limited until the relevant individual titles are issued and they provide the relevant settlement notice.
The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at stage 1 and at stage 2 of the acquisition.

    ments in level 1 are comprised of water shares and irrigation water rights.

 –– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

 –– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
    when determining an appropriate price.
