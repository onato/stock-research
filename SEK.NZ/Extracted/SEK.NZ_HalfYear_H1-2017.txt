From the Chairman and Chief Executive
In this review we comment on the financial performance for the 30 June half year, the operations of Seeka’s
business segments and provide an outlook for the financial year ending 31 December 2017.

The seasonal nature of Seeka’s main business segments of growing, packing, storing, shipping and selling fresh
produce means the company is more profitable in the first six months of each financial year. Accordingly the
financial performance for the half year does not reflect the company’s publicised guidance of operational earnings
for the 2017 financial year. Our guidance remains unchanged from earlier indications being operational earnings
may be up to 15% lower than 2016.




Highlights for the six months ended 30 June 2017
 •   Profit after tax of $11.09m (2016: $7.12m), an increase of 56%.

 •   Significant improvement in earnings from Seeka Australia with earnings before interest and tax of
     NZD$3.00m (2016: $1.23m), up 144%.

 •   Successful completion to the New Zealand avocado selling season with Seeka handling 487,095 export trays
     (2016: 225,656 export trays) delivering $24.85 per tray to growers (2016: $26.86).

 •   Successful and safe harvest seasons for all crops across Australia and New Zealand including kiwifruit,
     avocados, nashi, plums, pears and cherries.

 •   Installation of a new $5.8m Compac Spectrim packing machine at Main Road Katikati that offers automated
     grading with relocation of the existing machine to the Peninsula packhouse to handle increases in
     Coromandel-grown crop.

 •   Completion of the coolstore and pre-cooling capacity upgrades at Main Road, Katikati and at KKP and
     Transcool, Te Puke costing in excess of $9.2m.

 •   Initiation of Seeka’s Australian orchard plan that will result in Seeka developing at least 40 hectares of new
     kiwifruit orchard at Shepparton over the next five years.

             The following table outlines Seeka’s performance for the six months ended 30 June 2017. In preparing this table
             the 2016 result has been adjusted for non-recurring items including the grower incentive scheme costs for
             comparison with 2017.

             1. 2016 • Revenues increased by $2.9m ($2.1m after tax) for the grower incentive scheme, refer to Note 3 of the interim report.

                      • In addition to the above, EBITDA was reduced by a $0.5m benefit ($0.3m after tax) relating to the early termination of
                        long-term orchard lease agreements. Both are considered to be non-recurring items.


             2. 2017 • EBITDA was reduced by a non-recurring benefit of $0.1m ($0.07m after tax) relating to the early termination of a long-term
                       orchard lease agreement.

Dividend announcement
A dividend of $0.10 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid
on the 22 September 2017 to those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 15 September 2017. The dividend
reinvestment plan will apply to the distribution.



Outlook
Seeka is anticipating lower operational earnings for the full financial year in 2017 reflecting a significantly lower
Hayward (green) kiwifruit crop across New Zealand. Seeka’s New Zealand kiwifruit volumes were 21% lower than
the previous corresponding period (pcp).

Operational earnings are anticipated to be lower by up to 15% and this guidance remains in place. Seeka will
advise the market should there be a significant change in guidance and will confirm guidance at the stakeholder
meeting to be held on Wednesday 18 October 2017.

             Review of operations
             Revenue for the six months ended June 2017 totalled $134.01m (2016: $134.24m).

             Consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) totalled $21.93m (2016:
             $15.84m); up 38%. EBITDA from Seeka Australia totalled $3.41m (2016: $1.52m); up 124%.

             Profits are up in the first six months reflecting a strong lift in earnings in Australia and a lift in earnings from
             Seeka’s avocado business and seasonal timing differences.

             Consolidated profit after tax for the six months totalled $11.09m (2016: $7.12m); up 56%.

             Cash flow from operations totalled $1.13m (2016: $3.31m); down largely due to the decrease of green kiwifruit
             yields in the current year.

             Cash invested in property plant and equipment totalled $13.22m (2016: $24.84m); down on the pcp. Major capital
             expenditure items included packing plant at Peninsula and Main Road, and the completion of coolstores at Main
             Road and Transcool.

             Seeka’s New Zealand coolstore infrastructure is now largely in balance with 2018 expected crop volumes. The next
             large project under consideration is replacement of the KKP packing machine in 2019.

             Net debt at 30 June (bank loans less bank deposits) totalled $94.55m (2016: $76.87m); an increase of $17.68m.
             Advances of $7.5m were repaid from Seeka Growers to Seeka in July 2017.

             Orchard operations: activities include the servicing and growing of kiwifruit, kiwiberry and avocados through
             managed, leased and long term leased arrangements. Orchard operations span from Northland through the
             Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast.

             Kiwifruit volumes grown by Seeka decreased in 2017 following an industry-wide drop in green kiwifruit yields. For
             the 2017 kiwifruit harvest Seeka grew 30.70m kilograms (8.45m trays) compared to 40.57m kilograms in 2016
             (11.16m trays).

             In addition Seeka grew 0.54m kilograms of avocados (98,356 trays) in the 2016/17 harvest (2015/16: 0.054m
             kilograms, 9,818 trays). Seeka also grew 0.04m kilograms of kiwiberry (24,402 trays) for harvest 2017 (2016:
             0.03m kilograms, 20,202 trays).

             Total revenue for orchard operations for the six months of $36.83m compares with $37.70m in the pcp. EBITDA of
             $5.82m compares with $5.53m in the pcp.

             Post harvest operations: coordination of the harvest, packing, storage and dispatch of kiwifruit, kiwiberry and
             avocados to the market, or in the case of Zespri kiwifruit to the port.

             25.52m trays of kiwifruit were packed in 2017 (2016: 32.35m); a reduction of 6.83m trays being a direct effect of
             the industry-wide fall in green yields.




4   Seeka Limited | Interim report 30 June 2017
The company delivered a safe and timely harvest to growers. New coolstore infrastructure capacity builds at Main
Road, Transcool and the commissioning of a new Compac Spectrim grader at Main Road, including relocating the
existing Main Road grader to the Peninsula Packhouse in the Coromandel, were completed on time and within
budget. Seeka operates near infra-red scanning technology at Oakside and plans to install this technology at either
Huka Pak or Main Road for the 2018 season.

Post harvest revenue of $74.37m in the six months is a reduction on the pcp’s $78.03m reflecting lower packed
volumes. At 30 June 2017, Seeka’s coolstores were not full, and these lower fruit volumes will impact on storage
and load out income in the second half of the financial year.

Retail services operations: include the supply and sale of avocados, class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit and imported
tropical fruits. EBITDA of $1.32m compares favourably against pcp’s $0.52m reflecting a strong avocado sales
market in the first six months of the year. Earnings from imported tropical fruits were flat. The next avocado
harvest is expected to be down and affect second half year earnings.

Seeka Australia PTY Limited owns and operates predominately kiwifruit, nashi and pear orchards, packing and
logistics infrastructure. The company markets directly to retailers and wholesale markets for both Australian and
New Zealand-grown fruit.

The 2017 kiwifruit harvest yields and quality were better than 2016 while nashi volumes were below expectation.
Across all varieties Seeka is concentrating on quality as well as increasing yields. Historical volumes by variety are
in the following table:

             Seeka is further expanding its kiwifruit orchards with infill planting of existing orchards and the development of
             new orchards. Small new variety trials are underway.

             The Australian team is focussed on improving the presentation and quality of fruit sold to market. Shepparton can
             be a challenging environment to grow kiwifruit, however the fruit benefits from a hot climate, high sunshine and
             low rainfall. Consumer surveys confirm our Australian-grown kiwifruit has great taste. Customers have responded
             in paying a higher price.

             In other produce varieties including nashi and European pears Seeka has established a reputation for quality.
             Cherry plantings are reducing as aged trees are not replaced.

             EBITDA of $3.41m ( 2016: $1.52m) compares favourably with the pcp.

             The company’s Australian business is an important investment in diversity and we will continue to invest to further
             develop the business, including new orchards and improvements to existing orchards. Yields will improve over the
             next three years as new plantings mature.

             Seeka continues to closely monitor and invest in water to ensure that it has sufficient supply to grow existing and
             future crops.

             The Delicious Nutritious Food Company: Seeka’s new food business. The Delicious Nutritious Food Company
             produces three innovative products with a new manufacturing and processing facility commissioned at Seeka’s
             KiwiCoast facility (KCG) in Te Puke:

               •    Kiwi Crush - the Kiwi Crush range turns non-export grade kiwifruit into a high quality and high value
                    functional food sold to hospitals and the retail market.

               •    Avocado oil – the manufacture, processing, bottling and distribution of avocado oil products destined for
                    premium export markets.

               •    Kiwiberry – the specialist packing storage and distribution of kiwiberry, with a new punnet line to be installed
                    that will increase packing capacity for this high-value product.

             The Delicious Nutritious Food Company is delivering new income and profit streams to Seeka and is poised for
             further growth.



             Seeka 360
             Kiingi Tuheitia Potatau Te Wherowhero Tuawhitu opened Seeka’s new headquarters at Seeka 360 in March 2017.
             Kimihia House is the first stage in Seeka’s development of a centre of excellence for its growers and community.
             The building is now complete and the 7.9 hectare property is being developed into a GEM avocado orchard to
             show case Seeka’s GEM variety. The adjacent 5.4 hectare Pukenga Orchard is strategic land held for future post
             harvest development.

             Seeka is considering relocating the laboratory to Seeka360 as the next phase of the campus development.



6   Seeka Limited | Interim report 30 June 2017
The Seeka team
Seeka people have excelled through the six months. The company continues to refine its health and safety strategy
and systems to ensure that it complies with legislation and keeps its people, contractors and stakeholders safe.
During the six months a new health and safety manager was employed and a new safety team established. The
company is making excellent headway in its safety strategy and deployment.

The first project to develop inspirational leaders in the company was launched. Inaugural participants undertook a
two-day leadership programme and are now working through strategic projects for the company.

Sourcing seasonal labour continues to challenge the industry. Increasingly the industry is reliant on overseas
seasonal labour to complement the local available workforce. Seeka recruits some 460 overseas workers through
the RSE scheme from a total seasonal workforce of over 3,000. The company has gone to significant lengths to
ensure contractors and subcontractors comply with labour and health and safety legislation and that they also strive
to achieve best practice. Seeka has a dedicated team of personnel to work with our contractor and subcontractor
community to coach them, audit and undertake gap analysis to ensure that we achieve better than compliance.



Summary
Reduced Hayward yields will impact operational earnings for the 2017 financial year. Despite this the company
continues to invest in fruit handling infrastructure to meet additional SunGold volumes and anticipated
improvement in Hayward yields. Our strategy of geographic diversification continues. The Australian orchard
investment is performing well and will further improve as plantings mature over the next three years.

Great progress has been made in developing our people and keeping everyone on Seeka sites safe.

We thank all stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willing give to Seeka.

     Turnover
     The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group’s operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods
     and services provided to external customers during the period. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of
     growers and suppliers where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all
     produce sales both local and export.


     In the second half of the 2016 financial year the Group entered into a direct buying arrangement for the importation and supply of
     bananas in New Zealand whereby total revenues and expenses are reported in the statement of financial performance. Previously the
     Group had imported bananas on an agency arrangement whereby the Group only reported commission revenue. Had the current
     arrangement been in place at 30 June 2016 revenues would increase by $9.6m (Dec 16: $10.2m).

     Land and buildings
     Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction and
     in the 2015 financial year those damaged by the Oakside fire), plus any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation
     for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers, ANZIV, independent registered valuer. In Australia
     valuations are undertaken by Goulburn Valley Property Services, independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia.
     As at 30 June 2017 the directors believe there are no material indicators of impairment that would suggest that the carrying value of
     land and buildings differs from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue those assets at balance date.
