                Chair and Chief Executive's report



                Welcome to Seeka’s interim financial report and commentary for the six months ended 30
                June 2022. It’s been a tough six months for the Group with a backdrop of Covid-19, adverse
                weather events, extreme labour shortages, machine commissioning delays, shipping
                disruption, lower fruit yields and poor fruit quality all impacting performance. The Group
                has hunkered down, toughed it out and focussed on the immediate job of optimising its
                operations and results in a volatile environment with significant inflationary pressure and
                geopolitical events affecting key markets.
                The Seeka team have focussed on core business and operations having completed and integrated the
                OPAC, Orangewood and NZ Fruits businesses in the last twelve months. New Zealand kiwifruit crop
                volumes were well down on expectation across the industry. The Group has innovated in a tight labour
                market exacerbated by illness. Loyal personnel, including support staff, were redeployed to “play-out-of-
                position” at peak stress load to ensure the continuity of operations. The Group, at one stage, was short of
                more than 1,100 people from its New Zealand seasonal workforce but managed to get through the harvest
                with an influx of RSE workers from the Pacific Islands. The cost of labour has increased significantly as the
                Group competed to recruit staff to fully resource its operations. Seeka people have worked hard through the
                season. The new, highly automated MAF Roda kiwifruit packing machine was commissioned late at KKP as
                a result of shipping disruptions and the Group had to switch production to other sites to alleviate the delay.
                Weather also played its part in a challenging harvest as in late 2021 a storm in Ōpōtiki destroyed an
                estimated 2 million trays of kiwifruit crops, while an unseasonably late maturing Gisborne kiwifruit region
                was then hit with heavy and continuous rain.
                Shipping delays have disrupted the supply chain to market. Fruit quality in 2022 has been poor, creating
                pressure on fruit quality checking processes as the Group strives to deliver excellent fruit to the market.
                Ultimately the low-quality fruit later in the season has significantly impacted the costs of rechecking and
                fruit loss.
                Seeka Australia has performed well in the six months. The business has recovered from a challenging 2021
                and there are signs of improved earnings outlook for this business as the orcharding investments made in
                this business move into production.
                The Group has prepared and published its first Sustainability Report including three years of independently
                verified carbon footprint analysis. Seeka has adopted carbon reduction targets including a 30% reduction on
                baseline by 2025, 50% by 2030 and net zero by 2050.
                Seeka reminds readers that it operates in a seasonal business and industry where earnings can occur
                unevenly in the year with substantial earnings in the first six months associated with harvest in New
                Zealand and Australia. The Group has provided earnings guidance that it expects net profit before tax to be
                between $9m and $11m for the full year.

      Key financial components of the 2022 six months include:
      – $247.3m revenue (previous corresponding period to June 2021 (pcp): $224.5m); up 10.2%.
      – $49.4m EBITDA (pcp: $46.9m); up 5.3%.
      – $35.4m Earnings before interest and tax (pcp: $34.7m); up 2.0%
      – $30.1m profit before tax (pcp: $30.8m); down 2.3%.
      – $21.5m profit after tax (pcp: $20.6m); up 4.3%.
      – $594.4m of total assets; up 14.5% from the pcp.
      – $161.3m net interest-bearing debt; an increase of $33.4m from the pcp after purchases of Orangewood
        and NZ Fruits. At balance date Seeka had advanced $34.7m to growers which was substantially repaid in
        July (compared to $23.0m in the pcp).
      – No dividend payable at this time.


      Key operational components include:
      – Successful harvests, despite operational processing and capacity management issues across New
        Zealand and Australia including kiwifruit, avocado, kiwiberry, nashi and other pears in a very challenging
        environment
      – Integration of the new businesses into Seeka; while crop volumes were below expectation, these
        businesses are integrated and ready to deliver accretive earnings
      – Publication of Seeka’s first Sustainability Report
      – Excellent kiwiberry harvest and integrated packing and selling programme in conjunction with Freshmax.
        Fifth year of excellent returns to growers with average orchard gate returns over $200k per hectare.
      – Operational improvements at Seeka Australia, delivering earnings before interest and tax of $1.2m.

                Review of operations



                Financial
                Revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2022 of $247.3m was up 10.2% on the pcp (pcp:
                $224.5m). Consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was
                $49.4m (pcp: $46.9m); up 5.3%. Profit before tax of $30.1m compared with $30.8m in the pcp
                (down 2.3%).

                New Zealand orchard operations
                Orchard operations span from Northland through the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty,
                Ōpōtiki and Te Kaha. Orchard operations includes all aspects of growing and
                harvesting kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry on leased, long term leased, and Seeka-
                owned orchards. The orcharding business provides comprehensive orchard and vine
                management services to owners alongside contract work for orchard owners on an
                as-required basis. The business develops orchards for landowners on contract or
                under long term leases and in partnership with iwi.
                The Seeka business grew 17.1m trays of kiwifruit compared to 14.4m trays in the pcp. The Ōpōtiki
                growing region was hit hard by high winds and wild weather late in 2021 lowering crop volumes in
                this region by around 2m trays.
                Hayward yields were much lower than expected. The average 2022 Hayward production per hectare
                from Seeka’s orcharding operations of 8,497 trays is down on 2021 by 31% (pcp 12,302 trays per
                hectare).
                SunGold yields of 13,172 trays per hectare were also down 7.3% on 14,206 trays per hectare in 2021.
                Seeka also grew 1.610m kilograms of avocado (pcp: 1.394m kgs) and 116,400 kilograms of kiwiberry
                (pcp: 140,000 kgs), on orchards which it either owned or managed.
                Orchard operations revenue for the six months of $45.674m was down by $7.997m reflecting lower
                crop returns across kiwifruit and avocado. EBITDA for the period totalled $5.087m compared to pcp
                of $5.658m reflecting lower revenues from the markets and higher costs. The Group redeployed
                picking crews including RSE workers from the orchards to the packhouses to keep harvest operations
                fully functioning. The Group relied heavily on its contracting community where generally labour
                supply was sufficient compared to post-harvest which struggled for labour. This resulted in lower
                earnings to the orchard operations.
                Seeka continues to actively invest in long term orchard development with partners – currently with
                142 hectares of kiwifruit, 2 hectares of kiwiberry and 16 hectares of avocado in development. Fruit
                volumes from the orchard division are expected to increase as these orchards reach maturity.
                Our strategy is to continue to invest in long term leases to secure fruit supply.

                New Zealand post-harvest operations
                Post-harvest operates eleven packhouse facilities along with a network of coolstores.
                These packhouse facilities pack, cool and dispatch all produce from our orcharding
                operations and from our independent growers along with packing citrus and
                persimmons on contract for external marketers.

                                                                                                      Main contents




      In 2022, Seeka packed 43.3m trays of kiwifruit, above last year's combined 40.7m trays
      (including 3.5m trays OPAC). Hayward volumes were down 23.9% and SunGold volumes
      were up 35.2%, both significantly impacted by yield per hectare reductions despite the
      additional fruit provided by the recent acquisitions. In addition to packing avocados for
      its own marketing programmes, Seeka also packs citrus and persimmons on contract for
      third party marketers. Post-harvest revenue of $178.508m has increased from last season
      (pcp: $145.241m) reflecting the recent acquisitions and price increases. The cost of labour
      increased as the Group competed in a tight labour market and Covid-19 disruption. The
      compliance costs of meeting demanding market requirements also added cost pressure.
      EBITDA for the six months totalled, $52.867m compared to $49.128m in the pcp.

      New Zealand retail services operations
      Seekafresh retail services includes the supply, export and sale of avocados,
      kiwiberry and class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, sale of New Zealand kiwifruit
      through collaborative programmes, operation of the New Zealand wholesale
      marketing business including imported tropical fruits, and the manufacture and
      sale of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.
      Turnover decreased by 28.3% to $24.053m. EBITDA of $0.489m compares to a pcp of
      $1.907m reflecting a soft avocado market and the effect of Covid-19 disruptions on the
      market. Accounts with new customers have been established for the business which we are
      expecting to increase trading activity in the second half of 2022. Momentum continues to
      build with vibrant leadership, dedicated staff, great customer relationships and high-quality
      produce.

      Australia operations
      Seeka Australia Pty Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned company, leases and
      operates kiwifruit orchards, and owns and operates nashi and pear orchards
      along with associated post-harvest facilities in Victoria, directly marketing
      Seeka’s Australian produce domestically and to export customers.
      Seeka’s Australian business was affected by Covid-19 in the same way as New Zealand. The
      business adapted well under local management and delivered excellent results given the
      circumstances. Labour was very short, and there is continuing market disruption through
      lockdown events in Australia.
      The Australia team have innovated well with the management of on-orchard labour and post-
      harvest automation to deliver our customers excellent service and produce despite severe
      labour shortages and supply chain disruption. Kiwifruit volumes in Australia were lower
      following labour shortages leading to late work being undertaken on the orchards reducing
      yields. This has been rectified in the 2022 year for 2023. Markets were strong with good
      pricing and demand across all categories.
      Total revenue for the six months of $14.402m compared to pcp of $13.855m. EBITDA of
      $2.576m compared to pcp of $2.728m.

                Automation, technology and capacity
                Seeka has undertaken numerous automation trials and have brought the best equipment together
                in its latest packhouse investment at KKP. The eight-lane MAF Roda includes fully automated
                packaging presentation to the machine along with automated packing stations. The machine has a
                very low labour requirement through automation.
                The machine, fabricated in France, missed its April 6 commissioning date with supply chain
                disruptions leaving containers of key components in Singapore. It was ultimately successfully
                commissioned in June during the last week of the Hayward harvest. The machine has commissioned
                well and shown that it will deliver the automation benefits expected.
                Seeka has invested in further automation enhancements at the Oakside and Gisborne facilities.
                The Oakside investment includes Spectrim grading and pre-sizing on machine 3, which substantially
                reduces the manual grader requirements. Machine throughputs will be enhanced alongside a labour
                cost saving, since the investment reduces the number of operators.
                The Gisborne investment was already committed when Seeka purchased NZ Fruits. This investment
                includes automation of the placement and stacking of fruit post-packing. It removes labour and
                the bottleneck after packing. The operating machine hours at Gisborne will be increased and the
                automation will reduce the number of people required to run the machine.
                Seeka continues to consider its forward capacity equation balancing the likely future crop volumes
                with the required capacity to handle that volume at as close to its optimal time as possible. There
                is an anticipated increase in SunGold volumes coming combined with a growing sentiment that the
                final date of harvest needs to be earlier.
                Seeka, with the investments outlined, has sufficient capacity to handle the forecast crop volumes
                for 2023 and is considering the volumes and options beyond that. The substantial new Pukenga
                packhouse is unlikely to proceed in its previously anticipated form, with the Group considering all
                available options including a scaled down Pukenga build. Coolstorage capacity is also being assessed.
                These options will be considered by the Group through the second half of 2022.

                Sustainability
                Seeka has released its first Sustainability report for the Group. The publishing of the report is an
                important milestone in Seeka’s sustainability journey detailing the initiation of the sustainability
                team through to the verification of three years of carbon footprint calculations for Seeka and the
                establishment of our commitments to reduce our impact on the environment.
                As a result of these initiatives, Seeka has held its carbon footprint reasonably constant even though
                the Group has grown. It is our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint from the base year (2019)
                by 30% by 2025, 50% by 2030 and to be net carbon zero by 2050.
                This will be achieved by removing harmful refrigerants and limiting their leaks, switching to low
                emission vehicles and increasingly investing in solar. The Group has made good progress in
                understanding sustainability and our impact on the environments we operate in.

      Health and safety
      The continuing shortage of labour heightens the safety risk profile as the Group strives
      to deliver service to its grower customers. Seeka people have worked hard, in stressful
      circumstances, with the added anxiety of Covid-19. Seeka took all efforts to ensure that we
      kept our people safe and have continued to invest in their safety. Sites were effectively locked
      down to minimise the chance of spreading illness between operations. Support staff were
      required to work from home and the business pivoted to remove face-to-face meetings.
      The focus continues on physical safety with ongoing emphasis on barriers and guarding.
      Disappointingly Seeka had one serious harm injury at one of its new sites, Orangewood. In
      that incident a person fractured their arm having had clothing caught in a drive shaft while
      repacking fruit after the completion of harvest. It is disappointing given the significant effort
      and focus on safety throughout the Group and particularly through the heavy pressure of
      harvest.

      Strategic highlights
      The Group has continued to enact its strategy.
      The Group has concentrated on operational excellence undertaking disciplined
      planning to ensure that for each of the harvests and operations undertaken by Seeka
      that they are well planned and executed, that we have the capacity and pay attention
      to keeping people safe, while considering the financial attributes and contingency
      plans. The Group continues to implement and trial automation technologies to
      improve efficiency, remove labour and improve fruit quality throughout its operations.
      Seeka has also concentrated on supply chain efficiency in those parts of its business
      where it operates an integrated supply chain through to the market or customer. In the
      first six months, Seeka’s resilience has been tested and it has deployed its contingency
      plans in order to maintain service to our customers.

                Seeka has focussed on integrating and optimising the newly-acquired operations from its growth
                strategy. Seeka predominantly operates in the horticultural industry and therefore operates in a
                seasonal environment. Yields in 2022 were below normal and fruit quality has been challenging,
                however our planning expects these fluctuations to normalise. For now the Group is focused on
                delivering the best outcomes for this current season, however growth remains an important platform
                in Seeka’s strategy.
                Seeka has progressed its people and capability initiatives, made pleasing progress with its drive to
                understand and be more sustainable as a business, increased the headroom in its bank debt facilities,
                and maintained financial capability to invest and to deliver future earnings growth. The Group
                continues to concentrate on its foundation through disciplined planning.

                The Seeka team
                Seeka’s people have again excelled with the pressure of the harvest across Australia and New
                Zealand. They have adapted, innovated and strived through a challenging first six months.
                Dedicated key staff across the Group have worked hard to ensure the continuing operation of the
                business. Our people continue to make Seeka an inspiring produce company to work for and are
                celebrated for their efforts.

                Dividend
                The Board has determined that no dividend is payable at this time, with the dividend to be
                reconsidered later in the year.

                Outlook
                Seeka’s full year outlook is dynamic, with a challenging second six months forecast. Full year net
                profit before tax is forecast to be between $9.0m and $11.0m.

                Summary
                Seeka and its people have proven their resilience through a challenging first six months of 2022.
                Seeka operates predominantly in a seasonal horticultural industry reliant on the availability of
                labour. The Group remains focussed on core operations along with growing the crops for next year
                and ensuring appropriate post-harvest capacity is in place for future years. Seeka thanks its people,
                growers, contractor community, suppliers of goods and services and investors for their on-going
                support.

  owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with
  the landowner after all development and operational costs are

– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors and
management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expense associated with
debt (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large investments in fixed and leased
assets (EBITDA).

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

Accounting policies
All revenue contracts acquired as part of the Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited (OPAC), Orangewood Limited (Orangewood), and New
Zealand Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits) acquisitions, (see note 13) are substantially similar in nature to Seeka’s current revenue contracts, with the
exception of the timing of the cool storage revenue recognition related to OPAC, which is accounted for as fruit is packed rather than loaded out.
The Group's standard service contracts have applied to all the acquired entities since the end of 2021.

At 30 June 2022, 29.4 hectares of Northland orchards (Jun 2021 - 23 hectares) and 3.5 hectares of Ōpōtiki orchards (Jun 2021 - Nil) owned by Seeka
were classified as held for sale. No growing costs have been attributed to the remaining orchards at 30 June 2022 as they are valued on a crop-off
basis.
Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and
the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within one year from the date of classification. The accounting standard allows
for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control. In limited cases it has taken more than
12 months to find a willing buyer. However, Seeka remains committed to selling the properties and with the current interest in the properties sales
contracts are anticipated within the next 12 months. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less
costs to sell.


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group used estimates to judgementally classify a select group of Seeka's orchards as classified as held for sale, despite some of the orchards being
classified as held for sale for greater than 12 months.

         Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to
         the appropriate asset class. At 30 June 2022 the assets under construction relate to the Transcool coolstore construction, and further investment
         relating to packhouse automation.
         Land and buildings
         Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on at least a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
         any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations were undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers,
         ANZIV, independent registered valuer.
         In Australia valuations were undertaken by Preston Rowe Paterson Shepparton (previously known as Goulburn Valley Property Services),
         independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. All Australian land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2019.
         As at 30 June 2022 the Directors believe there are no indicators that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings differs materially
         from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue those assets at 30 June 2022. As part of the acquisitions, all acquired land
         and buildings were independently valued by Telfer Young Valuers, see note 13.
         Impairment
         In the six months to June 2022, $0.11m of assets were impaired. This related to the impairment of capitalised structures on a long-term-leased
         orchard.


         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         At 31 December 2021, 44% of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was revalued in line with policy. The change in property values in the
         current year is consistent with the valuations completed in the year ended 31 December 2021. Valuations for land and buildings have remained stable in
         the six months to June 2022, and have remained consistent with the fair values recognised at 31 December 2021.
         Seeka’s Australian properties are in the food production region of Victoria. The sale and leaseback transaction completed on 15 December 2020
         supports the carrying values of the remaining properties.
         Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued at December 2021 could cause an increase in land and buildings of a
         further 3-5%. This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

Additions to goodwill
$3.54m of goodwill was recognised during the six months to 30 June 2022 from the NZ Fruits acquisition, and a further $0.06m from updates
to the goodwill acquired in the Orangewood acquisition. $7.63m of goodwill was recognised during the 12 months to 31 December 2021 from
the OPAC acquisition, and with the addition of $0.62m from the Orangewood acquisition, goodwill of $8.25m was recognised for the full year
goodwill to 31 December 2021, see note 13.
Impairment tests for goodwill
At 30 June 2022, all goodwill balances were reviewed for indicators of impairment.
The kiwifruit harvest season for 2022 is complete and whilst the Seeka Group volumes have increased on the prior year, the volumes are down
on expectations. The variance to expectations has been driven by lower yields in both Hayward and SunGold. The lower yielding crop has been
offset by Seeka’s recent acquisitions and an increase in overall hectares due to new developments coming into production. The volume shortfall
has had a significant impact on expected earnings for the Group. However, the expectation is that future yields will return closer to the rolling
five-year average and total producing hectares for the Group continue to rise with new developments. This year’s yield reduction is not considered
an indicator of impairment as whilst it has had a significant effect on earnings in the current year, it is considered a one-off seasonal event and
the Group is anticipating a return to projected earnings from 2023 onwards. There are no indicators of impairment identified in the post harvest
business.
SeekaFresh has also been impacted by the lower volume kiwifruit crop in the 2022 season. The lower yields have led to lower volumes available
for retail sale in the New Zealand and Australian markets than was expected. Further, a challenging end to the 2021/22 avocado season reduced
the earnings in the first half of the 2022 year and the banana import markets have been challenged by supply chain issues. The fresh market
business has also experienced falling demand as a result of inflationary pressures. The SeekaFresh business has established new customers,
which are expected to lift earnings in the second half of the year. However, the 2022 financial year is expected to be a decrease on the prior year.
These factors combined reflect an indicator of impairment and an impairment test was completed on the SeekaFresh goodwill. Having completed
the impairment test using a value-in-use calculation and projected future earnings, no impairment was recognised at 30 June 2022.

         Kiwi Crush has had a solid six months to 30 June 2022 with kiwiberry volumes in line with forecast and returning a strong EBITDA. The full year
         performance is expected to end ahead of the prior year and the forecast for 2022. Demand continues to increase for the Kiwi Crush products in
         retail outlets, hospitals, and aged care facilities. There are no indicators of impairment identified in the Kiwi Crush business.
         No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an impairment of goodwill.


         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The review of intangible assets for impairment uses judgement to identify indicators of impairment and where an impairment test is performed,
         estimates of revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates are used.



         8. Biological assets - crop
         Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
         Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears, other pears, cherry, avocado, apricot, and plum crops growing on leased and
         owned orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.

         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The Group has reviewed trade and other receivables for any debtor impairment, credit risk, or any other such risks that may result in non-
         payment. The Group has not identified any circumstances where further provisioning or impairment of financial instruments is required.

         OGR of $6.62 per tray and a SunGold OGR of $11.03 per tray. Fruit inventory from fruit harvested from the Group’s Australian orchards is based on
         actual and forecast market returns for each variety.
         At balance date, $37.07m (June 2021 - $29.79m ) of packaging inventory costs were expensed to cost of sales in the statement of financial
         performance. There were no material inventory write downs (Jun 2021 - Nil).



         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The Group has reviewed inventory for any impairment risks and whether additional provisioning or write-offs are required. The Group considers
         all inventory will be able to be used in the normal course of business.

13. Business combinations
Acquisition through amalgamation of NZ Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits)
In February 2022, the Group amalgamated New Zealand Fruits Limited, a kiwifruit, citrus and persimmon post harvest business based in
Gisborne, East Coast, New Zealand, into a newly-formed 100%-owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Seeka East Limited. NZ Fruits shares
were cancelled with each share being exchanged for 7.5016 shares in Seeka and $39.3495 cash. Seeka shares were issued based on a price of
$5.2455 per Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 9 December 2021, with all fractions of Seeka
shares rounded up to the next whole number).
The purchase was settled on 2 February 2022 for a consideration of $17.53m by the issue of 1,687,860 ordinary shares in Seeka at a market price
of $5.14 on the settlement date of 2 February 2022, being the market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), and
a cash consideration of $8.85m. The change in the share price on acquisition date had the impact of decreasing goodwill by $0.18m.
NZ Fruits has contributed $12.14m of revenue and $1.34m of net profit before tax to the Group for the period 2 February to 30 June 2022. If the
acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2022, NZ Fruits would have contributed $12.45m of revenue and $0.84m of net profit before tax for the
six months ended 30 June 2022. These calculations are not significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies between the Group and
the acquired subsidiary, and no significant additional depreciation would have been charged for fair value adjustments to property, plant and
equipment had it applied from 1 January 2022, including consequential tax effects.
The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

         NZ Fruits fair value of assets and liabilities, goodwill and acquisition-related costs
         The fair value of acquired trade receivables is $0.34m. There is no loss allowance recognised on acquisition. The goodwill of $3.54m is allocated
         to the renamed Bay of Plenty and East Coast post harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of the amalgamation was to obtain
         the packhouse facility and increase the Group's presence in the East Coast, which is adjacent and complementary to the main Bay of Plenty
         operations. The goodwill is attributable to the operation’s market position in the region and synergies expected to arise after adding the business
         into the corporate structure provided by the larger Seeka Group. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired in the foreseeable future and is not
         expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
         Acquisition-related costs of $0.36m are included in overhead expenses in 2022. Deferred tax of $0.23m has been provided in relation to
         differences between tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets.
         Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the fair values of the assets and liabilities disclosed above if more information comes
         to light that suggests the values differ. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the
         acquisition date.

         Acquisition through amalgamation of Orangewood Limited (Orangewood)
         In November 2021, the Group amalgamated Orangewood, an integrated kiwifruit and avocado post harvest and orchard management business
         based in Kerikeri, Far North District, New Zealand, into a newly formed 100% owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Northland Horticulture
         Limited. Orangewood shares were cancelled with each share being exchanged for 0.663 shares in Seeka and $1.35 cash. Seeka shares were issued
         based on a price of $5.33 per Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 13 September 2021, with all
         fractions of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole number).
         The purchase was settled on 22 November 2021 for a purchase consideration of $4.66m by the issue of 639,302 ordinary shares in Seeka Limited
         at a market price of $5.25 on the settlement date of 22 November 2021, being the market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3, and a
         cash consideration of $1.30m. The change in the share price on acquisition date had the impact of decreasing goodwill by $0.05m.
         The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

         Orangewood fair value of assets and liabilities, goodwill and acquisition-related costs
         The fair value of acquired current trade receivables, within trade and other receivables, is $1.55m. There was no loss allowance recognised on
         acquisition. The initially acquired goodwill of $0.62m was allocated to the Northland post harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of
         the amalgamation was to obtain the packhouse facility and increase the Group's presence in the desirable Far North District. The goodwill was
         attributable to the operation’s market position in the region and synergies expected to arise after adding the business into the corporate structure of
         the larger Seeka Group. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired in the foreseeable future and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
         Acquisition-related costs of $0.37m were included in overhead expenses in 2021. Deferred tax of $0.25m was provided in relation to differences
         between tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets.
         Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the fair values of the assets and liabilities disclosed above if more information comes
         to light that suggests the values differ. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the
         acquisition date.
         Seeka has identified and updated the fair values of assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and completeness of payroll-related accruals made in
         the initial fair values as disclosed in December 2021 and the tax implications arising as a result. The net impact is an increase in goodwill by $0.06m.

         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The fair values of the assets are subject to estimates and judgement. Seeka engaged Telfer Young to complete an independent valuation of the land
         and buildings at the acquisition dates. The remaining plant and equipment were assessed on a depreciated historical cost basis, as well as a physical
         stocktake and a comparison to similar Seeka-owned assets. The Group assessed that an intangible asset exists for grower relationships and contracts
         at NZ Fruits, which is immaterial for financial reporting using the multi-period excess earnings method of calculating intangible assets on contracts.

On 20 January 2022, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend was paid on 23 February 2022 to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 28 January 2022. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with no discount to the strike price.
This full year dividend is normally paid in April each year, but was varied due to new shares being issued ex-div in February.
In the last 12 months, $0.26 has been paid in dividends per share (prior 12 months $0.34).
The cash dividend paid was $4.37m at June 2022.

15. Share capital
On 2 February 2022, the Group acquired NZ Fruits for a recorded consideration of $17.53m, by issuing 1,687,860 ordinary Seeka shares at $5.2455
per share totalling $8.68m, and a cash consideration of $8.85m, see note 13.
During the period to 30 June 2022, $1.22m (Jun 2021 - $0.66m) was received in relation to shares issued under the employee share scheme
established in 2016 and the Grower and Employee share scheme(s) established in 2019 (including funds from the vesting of the schemes).
During the period to 30 June 2022, 124,262 shares were issued under the dividend reinvestment plan related to the dividend paid in February
2022 (Dec 2021 - 290,245), see note 14.

16. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table analyses financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as at 30 June 2022.
The different levels are defined as:
– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
  Instruments in level 1 are comprised of water shares and irrigation water rights.
– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
  when determining an appropriate price.

         New Zealand business on behalf of supplying growers. In the current period the Group received $139.03m (Jun 2021 - $110.11m) for the provision

         existing banking syndicate. The purpose of the new facility was to refinance the Orangewood and NZ Fruits acquisition debt from the flexi facility
