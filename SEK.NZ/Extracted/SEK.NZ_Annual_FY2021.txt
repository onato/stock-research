   Our produce business
   Select excellence from orchard to market




   Seeka grows, processes and supplies premium, healthy fruit to domestic and international consumers. We are
   founded on kiwifruit and have expanded to be New Zealand and Australia’s largest kiwifruit grower. We also
   grow and supply New Zealand kiwiberry, avocados and citrus and Australian nashi, pears and other fruits.
   We supply Zespri with premium New Zealand kiwifruit, while also servicing key retail customers in New Zealand, Australia and other
   international markets. We also sell fresh produce from our Auckland wholesale market.
   We are a large regional employer, operating packing and coolstore facilities in all major kiwifruit and avocado growing regions in New
   Zealand’s North Island. Seeka also operates orchard and post harvest facilities in Victoria Australia, with Australians buying Seeka-
   supplied fruit all year round.
   We deliver excellence in supply chain management, and have extended our services to import and condition tropical fruits for New
   Zealand retailers, plus we produce and sell avocado oil and the digestive aid Kiwi Crush.
   At Seeka, we deliver excellence from orchard to market.

   Automation, technology and capacity
   Implementing new technology along Seeka's full value chain




   Seeka continues to test and then invest in automation and new technologies that are reliable, provide
   the opportunity to redeploy labour, and generate a return on capital. Innovations are being implemented
   across our full value chain in New Zealand and Australia.
                                           Seeka’s investment in Fruitometry provides direct access to smart-scanning
                                           technology. By detailing fruit density and condition, the online Fruitometry maps
                                           provide orchard owners with accurate information to optimise on-orchard work. It
                                           also provides reliable information to Seeka’s post harvest team to plan supply chain
                                           operations.
                                           In post harvest, new automated tray-preparation, bag inserters and packing
                                           machines for bulk boxes and single-layer trays have been implemented, along with
                                           automated pallet strappers. A fully-automated packing and stacking option will be
                                           trialled at Seeka’s NZ Fruits facility in 2023.
                                           In Australia, Seeka has implemented new packing technologies, including a new
                                           nashi machine to carefully grade and pack this delicate fruit. By removing hand
                                           grading the new nashi machine has improved fruit quality and delivered efficiency
                                           gains to our operations.
                                           The Group continues to innovate its management systems, particularly labour

                                           Post harvest capacity is continuously reviewed, and the decision to build a
                                           greenfield facility at Pukenga has been deferred until there is more certainty on
                                           demand, pack configuration and shipping.
                                           To meet near-term capacity demand, a $20 million build at KKP and Transcool
                                           has been commissioned. KKP is being upgraded with a highly-automated MAF
                                           Roda packline that will lift shed capacity and reduce the labour load. A new

                                           under construction at Transcool. These upgrades are expected to deliver sufficient
                                           capacity through to 2024.

   Labour and safe-and-healthy workspaces
   Delivering a professional service and keeping our people safe
   in a fast-paced environment



   Labour is an ongoing challenge for all producers, service providers and exporters across New Zealand
   and Australia. Severe shortages at peak periods were experienced in 2020 and 2021. Seeka was short of
   skilled orcharding and packhouse workers in both countries. The company has invested in on-site gyms,
   provided transport and meals, and paid competitive remuneration, including working and paying public
   holidays in the season to attract staff.
   Additionally, our teams are collaborating with iwi and
   government agencies and run induction programmes at our
   facilities to train job seekers and prepare them for work.
   Local workers are complemented by New Zealand’s RSE
   programme. In 2021, at a cost of $1.9 million we recruited
   300 RSE workers from the Government’s 2000 RSE quota.
   Including RSE workers that remained in the country since

   While labour shortages exacerbated the safety risk profile,
   our safety focus continues to lift and Seeka has become a
   safer company in 2021. Seeka continues to invest to keep
   people safe, including adding more guarding and barriers
   that remove opportunities for mobile plant and humans to
   collide, and rolled out a new HIT-NOT proximity detection
   system that detects and protects people from moving
   forklifts. These actions have helped eliminate serious harm

   Outlook
   Delivering performance to shareholders, employees
   and supply chain partners




   The Board and management have enacted Seeka's strategy in 2021,
   with the Group completing key investments that are positioned to
   further improve shareholder returns in 2022.
   Seeka is pursuing an active growth strategy through acquisitions to build shareholder
   value and lift returns on capital employed. By becoming bigger and more diverse, Seeka
   is building a robust, sustainable business to deliver performance to shareholders,
   employees and our supply chain partners.
   Throughout this growth process, the Board keeps a careful watch on Seeka's balance
   sheet to ensure we have headroom to prioritise operations, manage risk, and invest
   in opportunities that drive shareholder returns. With broad support from the banking
   community, we have secured an enlarged syndicated banking facility that supports
   near-term growth.
   Key to our operational success is Seeka's dedicated team of employees in New Zealand
   and Australia. Seeka’s people have excelled under the pressure of Covid-19 and labour
   shortages across New Zealand and Australia. They have adapted, innovated and
   strived to deliver an excellent service and returns to our growers, and excellent fruit
   quality to our customers.
   We invest in the safety of our people, and set remuneration structures, training and
   career pathways that attract and promote the best people within our industry. Our
   people continue to make Seeka an inspiring company to work for and are celebrated
   and thanked for their efforts.
   We continue to review our post harvest capacity and are investing in new technology
   to manage volume growth through to 2024. We recognise that innovation and
   automation are key to improving productivity and making the best use of a tight
   seasonal labour market. At Seeka, we achieve operational excellence by having a
   professional team execute a disciplined plan using the best technology.
   Our strategy extends beyond operational and financial performance to ensure we have
   a sustainable business which includes how we support our communities, care for our
   environment and govern the company. We are progressing our carbon footprint plan to
   reduce Seeka's environmental impact.
   We are excited by the progress we have made in FY21, which has grown our fruit
   supply base by more than 25%, and look forward to tangible benefits being generated
   for stakeholders in FY22.

   SEEKA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
   ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
   Sustainability focuses on meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Seeka’s
   ambition is to measure and incrementally improve our environmental and social performance and the associated governance processes
   and to demonstrate that we are meeting our corporate responsibilities as a sustainable company.

   Environmental sustainability lies at the heart of Seeka’s brand attribute Growing Futures; Seeka is focused on continually improving
   operations to deliver healthy produce, use less resources, care for the environment, and deliver better outcomes to stakeholders.

   Social responsibility lies at the heart of Seeka's brand attribute Founded on Relationships; Seeka wants to be the employer and service
   provider of choice and values its connections to the communities with whom it works. It cares for the welfare of its growers, clients,
   employees, investors and the communities in which it operates.

   The sustainability committee is tasked with providing strategic guidance and feedback to the Board and management on Seeka's
   sustainability framework, establishment of targets, measurement, and performance monitoring. Comprised of three directors, Seeka’s
   sustainability committee is a forum that works with management to assess the potential impacts and opportunities of a changing climate.

   Governance
   Seeka's strategic direction is based on the sustainable production and supply of healthy produce to consumers.

   Governance is specifically covered as a section in this annual report, see page 77.

   Environmental report
   Seeka's aim is to be an industry leader, transparently reporting on our environmental impact and the opportunities and risks associated
   with climate change.

   Seeka's Agile Sustainability Team (SAST) is representative of all of Seeka’s businesses connecting people from across the company.
   They work to integrate sustainability into every aspect of our business, including delivering projects intended to reduce Seeka’s
   environmental footprint.

   Climate change is an active risk, impacting the yield, quality and marketability of the produce Seeka grows and handles. By disclosing
   climate-related risks, stakeholders can see how Seeka is flexing business activities and operations to mitigate environmental risks and
   embrace new opportunities.

   Seeka is committed to advancing regenerative horticulture practices. Seeka's research and development team are conducting
   environmental trials to better understand the impact to our environment of inputs such as sprays, fertilisers and irrigation. These trials
   build knowledge that leads to more sustainable on orchard practices that are shared with our growers.

   Seeka has analysed all business operations to identify and understand the production inputs, how they flow through the business, and
   the waste outputs that impact the environment. Seeka is working to transition to a circular model whereby waste is circulated back into
   operations, thereby reducing its environmental impact.

   Risk and opportunity analysis
   The Ministry for the Environment studied how climate change may impact New Zealand. Based on its report, Seeka expects our
   orcharding regions will be impacted by higher temperatures, changing moisture levels, changing weather patterns and rising sea levels.

   Seeka's 2022 environmental work programme
   Scenario analysis – understanding how a changing climate impacts fruit production

   Scenario analysis is underway to gauge how higher temperatures, varying water availability and rising sea levels may impact New
   Zealand orchard production. By understanding how a changing climate may impact crop yields and quality, Seeka can prepare its
   operations to provide an efficient, sustainable service to Seeka's growers and a reliable product supply to consumers.

   Carbon footprint – measuring and setting targets

   Seeka is committed to understanding and lowering its carbon footprint to support Government targets under the Paris Agreement
   intended to limit global temperature increases to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.

   Seeka has established a baseline by calculating 2019 greenhouse gas emissions using ISO 14064-1: 2018 Greenhouse Gases and the
   Greenhouse Gas Protocol, see ghgprotocol.org, with the calculations independently verified by Toitu Envirocare. Toitu Envirocare has also
   been engaged to verify Seeka's 2020 and 2021 years. Seeka will then set ‘point in time’ carbon-reduction targets.

   The 2020 and 2021 results will be reported in Seeka's sustainability report once verified.

         The Group also produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
         – Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
           whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
           orchard owners.
         – Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
           productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
           owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
           landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
         – Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
           costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
         Post harvest operations
         The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
         citrus, berry, and kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the
         Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from
         independent orchard owners.




         EBITDA and EBIT
         EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
         reflects operating cash flow generation.
         EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
         Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
         information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors and
         management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expense associated with
         debt (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large investments in fixed and leased
         assets (EBITDA).

         Turnover
         The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
         services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
         where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

 Accounting policies
 Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.
 Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date,
 and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.
 Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and liabilities
 and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability
 in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable profit. Differences relating to investments in
 subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that
 have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.
 A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
 differences can be utilised.




7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following table details the offset amounts.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2020 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.
Legislation enacted 25 March 2020 reinstated tax depreciation deductions on non-residential buildings. This resulted in a one-off $5.6m gain in
the income tax calculation for the 2020 financial year, see note 6.

8. Events occurring after balance date
On 10 December 2021, the Group announced the conditional acquisition of New Zealand Fruits Limited (NZ Fruits) by way of amalgamation with
Seeka East Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, for an enterprise value assessed at $21.90m. As at 31 December 2021 balance date
the amalgamation was subject to a number of conditions including NZ Fruits shareholder approval, which was then subsequently obtained post
year end on 19 January 2022. The settlement and amalgamation was completed after balance date, on 2 February 2022 with the issue of 1,687,860
Seeka shares and a cash payment of $8.85m to NZ Fruits shareholders. As at this reporting date a detailed assessment of the fair value of acquired
net assets has not been performed due to limited time available between settlement date and the preparation of the financial statements.
On 20 January 2022, the Group declared a full year dividend of $0.13 per share in relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2021. The
dividend will be fully imputed, and the dividend reinvestment plan will apply. The dividend record date is 28 January 2022 and the dividend will be
paid on 23 February 2022.
On 2 February 2022 Seeka completed the acquisition of New Zealand Fruits Limited by way of amalgamation which included consideration of new
Seeka shares to be issued ex-dividend and cash. The full year dividend is normally paid in April each year, however this year the payment date for
the full year dividend has been varied to ensure the new shares relating to NZ Fruits are issued ex-dividend on their issue date.
There are no other material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statements.

         Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
         continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and
         the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within one year from the date of classification. The accounting standards allow
         for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control. In limited cases it has taken more than
         12 months to find a willing buyer, however Seeka remains committed to selling the properties and with the current interest in the properties sales
         contracts are anticipated within the next 12 months. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
         At 31 December 2021, 13 hectares of orchards (Dec 2020 - 23 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. These properties were
         part of the 2018 purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited.
         Sale and leaseback transaction in Seeka Australia
         Assets related to three kiwifruit orchards in Australia (Hayward, Austral and Lakes) were recognised as held for sale at 31 December 2019. On 15
         December 2020, the Group sold the three orchards for AU$26.50m and leased them back for an initial term of 10.5 years, with rights of renewal out
         to 25 years. The terms of the sale and leaseback are typical of those entered into for an orchard.
         The definition of a sale under NZ IFRS 15 was met and the transaction was carried out at fair value. Sales proceeds received were judged to reflect
         the fair value of the underlying assets. The quarterly rental was deemed to be a fair market rent.
         The transaction was accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 98 to 103 of NZ IFRS 16 and the Group estimated the present value of the rental
         obligations in respect of the leaseback to be AUD$14.08m (NZD$15.01m), based on the initial term of the leaseback of 10.5 years, discounted at an
         incremental borrowing rate of 6.79% per annum, with the transaction giving rise to the following:
         – Right of use asset of AUD$7.47m (NZD$7.97m)
         – Net proceeds from sale and leaseback of AUD$26.50m (NZD$28.24m)
         – Lease liability assumed of AUD$14.08m (NZD$15.01m)
         – Net gain on sale and leaseback of AUD$5.83m (NZD$6.18m)
         All goodwill from the Australia cash generating unit was allocated in 2019 to the disposal group, based on the Group's assessment of relative fair
         values of the assets held for sale and Australia assets being retained.



         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The Group used estimates to judgementally recognise the remaining Northland orchards as held for sale, despite being classified as held for sale for
         greater than 12 months. For the year ended 31 December 2020 the Group used judgement to classify the Australian sale and leaseback as an asset held
         for sale and estimates to calculate and judgementally recognise the gain on sale. This included judging the right-of-use lease asset, lease liability, lease
         term and estimated discount rate.

         4. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the investment method
           and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market rentals and estimated costs incurred
           to maintain land and buildings in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are sold in the terminal year (year 11).
         The net book value of land is $36.87m (Dec 2020 - $23.43m) and buildings is $191.65m (Dec 2020 - $147.14m), see note 29.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 31 December 2021, 44% of Seeka's New Zealand land and building portfolio was revalued in line with policy. The change in property values in the
current year is consistent with the valuations completed in the year ended 31 December 2020 and results in 91% of Seeka's New Zealand property
portfolio being revalued over a two year period. Seeka operates in the food production industry, which remained stable with a high demand for healthy
foods during the Covid-19 pandemic. Properties situated in the Bay of Plenty are also expected to be less affected than other regions given the ongoing
strength of horticulture and agriculture businesses.
Seeka’s Australian properties are in the food production region of Victoria. The sale and leaseback transaction completed on 15 December 2020
supports the carrying values of the remaining properties.
Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause an increase in land and buildings of a further 3-5%.
This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

         Impairment tests for goodwill
         The Board reviews business performance based on operating segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level. Goodwill
         represents the 2021 acquisitions of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited and Orangewood Limited, the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete
         Coolstores Limited, the 2018 acquisition of the Northland business, the previously-acquired Glassfields business (now named SeekaFresh) and
         the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges.
         The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value in use), with a terminal value
         beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated in this note.
         The assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit, is determined based on past
         performance and the Board's expectations of future market dynamics, plus the Group's five year financial plans. The Group's market capitalisation
         compared to net assets is also considered as part of the impairment review.
         All amounts recognised as goodwill at 31 December 2021 were tested for impairment at balance date and no impairment arose in the current year.
         Additions to goodwill
         $8.25m of goodwill was recognised during the year; $7.63m from the OPAC acquisition, and $0.62m from the Orangewood acquisition. No
         goodwill was recognised for the year ended 31 December 2020, see note 19.
         Cash generating units (CGUs)
         During the year ended 31 December 2021, the scope of the post harvest CGUs were reviewed. Previously the CGUs were defined as each packhouse
         but following the review it was determined that with a number of recent acquisitions and growth in the business it was more appropriate that the post
         harvest CGUs represented the group of packhouses in a region that operated as a collective group, with fruit allocated to sites within the region.
         This reflects the operational coordination of packhouses in each region to maximise efficiency and flexibility by packing fruit at the optimum maturity
         by allocating it to the next available facility. Fruit in Northland is not generally directed to the Bay of Plenty region, so this segment remains on its own
         for consideration of goodwill. It was determined that there are two regional CGUs for the post harvest operations, being Northland and Bay of Plenty
         (including Coromandel).
         The goodwill that had been previously allocated to the Northland business is now part of the Northland postharvest CGU, along with the recent
         Orangewood acquisition. The Aongatete Coolstores Limited goodwill is now part of the Bay of Plenty post harvest CGU which now includes the
         goodwill recognised for the OPAC acquisition in 2021.
         The following table details the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations and the recoverable amount.

         1. The discount rate is calculated based on the specific circumstances of the cash generating unit and its operations, and is derived from its
            weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate for Seeka's Bay of Plenty CGU is set at 8% as this represents the Board's assessment of the
            Group's weighted average cost of capital with an additional 1% added to recognise the higher risk of a smaller division.
         2. The long term growth rate is based on growth in GDP, market conditions and opportunities for growth within the industry. The Group has set its
            terminal growth rates between 1% - 2% to ensure a long term conservative growth estimate has been applied in the impairment tests.
         3. If the EBITDA growth rates reduced to 2%, there is no impairment.
         4. The EBITDA growth rates used for the Northland packhouse reflect the expected increase in SunGold kiwifruit volumes as plantings come into
            production during the period being assessed, with 18% revenue growth expected in the second year, falling to 3% by year five. If the revenue
            growth rates reduced to 2% in years 2 to 5, there would be no impairment.
         5. The EBITDA growth used for the SeekaFresh business reflects the expected performance of the business over the period being assessed. A 10%
            revenue growth rate is expected in the first year as the business recovers from Covid-19 lockdowns in Auckland.
         6. The EBITDA and terminal growth rates used for Kiwi Crush reflects expected performance over the next 5 years as the business continues to
            commercialise new product lines and explore new markets.

At 31 December 2021, all goodwill balances were reviewed for indicators of impairment.
The goodwill relating to the Bay of Plenty Post Harvest and Northland Post Harvest cash generating units are supported by 2021 operational
outcomes. 2021 kiwifruit harvest volumes increased on the prior year and packing volumes are expected to increase further in future years. Whilst
Covid-19 impacted 2021 costs and labour supply, the post harvest segment operated profitably throughout the year, and throughout national
and localised lockdowns. For these reasons, there are no indications of impairment of the goodwill relating to the Bay of Plenty Post Harvest or
Northland Post Harvest cash generating units.
The goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush business is supported by current trading performance. There are no indications of impairment of the
goodwill relating to the Kiwi Crush business.
SeekaFresh started the year well, until sales were impacted by Covid-19. The business continued to operate as an essential service, but was
affected by the temporary closure of hospitality and independent retail based customers during the lockdown. Following completion of the
restructuring period for SeekaFresh in 2020, the commission business (which includes the domestic and export sales of Seeka-grown avocado,
kiwiberry, and class two, class three, and collaboratively marketed kiwifruit), is integrated with the original Glassfields business to a degree where
it is indistinguishable from the original cash generating unit, and has therefore been included in the forecasted EBITDA assumptions. The terminal
growth rate has remained consistent, but sensitivity was performed to ensure a 1% terminal growth rate would not result in an impairment.
No other reasonable changes to key assumptions would require an impairment of goodwill.




Accounting policies
Intangible assets
Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested at least annually for impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the
recoverable amount. When assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able to generate cash flow.
Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. Internally
developed computer software is capitalised when it enters the development phase and includes costs incurred to develop and test the software
for use. Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life (typically three to five years).
Costs relating to software deemed to be classified as software as a service (S.A.A.S.) have been expensed during the year and included in the
statement of financial performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill on a business acquisition is included in intangible assets, and on acquisition of an associate is included in investments in
associates. When acquired in business combinations, the goodwill is annually tested for impairment (or more frequently if deemed prudent)
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to that business.
Water shares
The Group records permanent water shares at fair value based on the market price at balance date. The shares are fully tradeable and have an
indefinite life and are not amortised.
Other intangibles
Other intangibles subject to amortisation are amortised over the life of the asset on a straight line basis. The expense is charged to the statement
of financial performance.




Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The intangible assets impairment tests require judgement to determine the appropriate forecast cash flows and inputs into the calculations. The primary
estimates relate to the forecast EBITDA growth rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates.

         Crop where cost is deemed fair value
         Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date and as
         such cost is deemed fair value, see note 29.
         During the year $1.4m of biological assets within the 1 January 2021 opening balance relating to the Groups long-term orchard developments were
         reclassified as bearer plants assets under construction (Dec 2020 - nil)



         Accounting policies
         Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair value depends
         on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
         When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (provided the costs are
         considered recoverable). When costs are not considered recoverable they are expensed in the statement of financial performance.
         When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.
         The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference to current and expected sales returns when available. When market data is
         not available an assessment is made based on historical data.




         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The valuation of biological assets uses estimates of market returns to determine value.

Additions
On 15 December 2020, the Group completed a sale and leaseback transaction for three kiwifruit orchards totalling 199 hectares in Australia. The
completion of this sale created a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability, with the difference between the two recognised as a gain on sale
through the statement of financial performance.
On 4 May 2021, the Group acquired OPAC, which included $0.55m of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities, see note 19.

         Accounting policies
         Lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, including any renewal periods that are likely to be exercised,
         discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate which ranges between 3% and 11%. The discount rate is based on the Group's
         incremental borrowing rate, being the rate the Group would borrow the funds required to purchase the asset. When determining the discount rate,
         Seeka considers that the value of the right-of-use lease asset should not be greater than the fair value of the underlying asset being leased.
         The Group’s right-of-use lease asset is equal to the lease liability on the day of lease inception, with the exception of sale and leaseback
         transactions where the asset is measured as the proportion of the carrying value of the asset sold of which the benefit is retained by the Group.
         The right-of-use lease asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Costs incurred with a lease that are not part of the
         cost of the right-of-use lease asset are expensed.
         All leases have been classified into one of the following asset classes:
         – Land and building - leases for rental of all properties, including packhouses and coolstores
         – Orchard - leases held for the development of productive orchards
         – Equipment - leases for equipment, including plant equipment and forklifts

         – Motor vehicles - three year leases for motor vehicles
         The Group leases various properties for the packing and cooling of kiwifruit, leases orchards to grow kiwifruit and avocados, and leases equipment
         and vehicles. The terms of the leases vary, with land and building leases ranging from 10 - 15 years, with one 99 year lease. Orchard leases range
         from 3 - 25 years, and equipment and vehicle leases range from 1 - 3 years.
         Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. In the case of orchard leases, only the fixed rental is recognised as a lease liability.
         Any variable consideration relating to profit share on the orchard leases is not accounted for as the profit share is only determined after a crop has
         been harvested and is not identifiable at the commencement of the lease. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide
         range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interest in the leased assets
         that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
         The Group is exposed to potential future increases in land and building lease payments based on contractual market rent reviews that are not
         included in the lease liability until the rent review takes place.
         Lease payments are allocated between principal and lease interest. The lease interest is charged to the statement of financial performance over
         the term of the lease.




         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The valuation of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities uses judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rate and the likelihood of
         exercising any rights of renewal to extend the lease term.

relating to 399 hectares (Dec 2020 - 484 hectares).
$2.26m of accrued income relates to funds still be received in relation to the settlement of the Psa claim.
Within current trade receivables, $2.49m are past due (Dec 2020 - $1.97m), of which 1.81% are more than 90 days (Dec 2020 - 1.6%). Non-
current trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up
to five years.
A $0.25m provision for doubtful debts is recognised in the accounts (Dec 2020 - $0.16m).



Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.



Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group reviewed trade and other receivables for any debtor impairment, credit risk, or any other such risks that may result in non-payment.
The Group did not identify any circumstances that required further provisioning or impairment of financial instruments.

In the current year, $30.25m (Dec 2020 - $27.48m) of packaging inventory costs were expensed to cost of sales in the statement of financial
performance.



Accounting policies
Raw materials, work in progress, finished goods and produce are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct
materials and direct labour, and are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average cost. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sales costs.

         Accounting policies
         Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value (the invoiced amount). If the Group has been provided with extended terms of trade, they are
         then recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The Board has assessed the fair value of the term loans as the outstanding balance at balance date.
On 10 November 2021, Seeka's banking facilities were refinanced via a Syndicated Facilities Agreement (Bank Syndicate) with Westpac New
Zealand Limited acting as the Agent and Security Trustee. Lenders to the Banking Syndicate include ASB Bank Limited, Bank of New Zealand,
Rabobank New Zealand Limited (Rabobank), Westpac Banking Corporation of Australia, and Westpac New Zealand Limited. It is expected that all
facilities will be refinanced when they become due for review as set out below.
The following table details the amounts of the term loans drawn down at balance date and their maturities.

         Accounting policies
         Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
         When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction
         cost. When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the
         period of the facility.
         Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
         after balance date.

Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.



19. Business combination
Acquisition through amalgamation of Ōpōtiki Packing and Cool Storage Limited (OPAC)
During the year the Group acquired OPAC, a kiwifruit post harvest and orcharding business based in Ōpōtiki, the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, into a
newly-formed 100% owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Seeka OPAC Limited. OPAC shares were cancelled with each share being exchanged
for 1.4833 shares in Seeka Limited, based on a price of $4.82 per Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing
on 24 March 2021, with all fractions of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole number). The purchase was settled 4 May 2021 for a recorded
consideration of $38.73m when Seeka issued 7,042,574 ordinary shares at $5.50, being the share market price on the acquisition date as per NZ
IFRS 3. The change in share price between the VWAP and the share price on acquisition date had the impact of increasing goodwill by $4.80m.
On acquisition, the Group drew down a $27m loan to repay the acquired interest bearing liabilities of $21.86m, with the remainder used to service
OPAC's working capital requirements for the remainder of the season.
OPAC contributed $29.46m of revenue and $1.07m of net profit before tax to the Group for the period from 4 May to 31 December 2021. If the
acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021, OPAC would have contributed $36.06m of revenue and $2.87m of net profit before tax for the 12
months ended 31 December 2021. These calculations are not significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies between the Group
and the acquired subsidiary, and no significant additional depreciation would have been charged if fair value adjustments to property, plant and
equipment had applied from 1 January 2021, including consequential tax effects.
The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

         OPAC fair value of assets and liabilities, goodwill and acquisition-related costs
         The fair value of acquired trade receivables, within trade and other receivables, is $0.40m. There was no loss allowance recognised on acquisition.
         The goodwill of $7.63m is allocated to the Bay of Plenty post harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of the amalgamation was to
         obtain the post harvest facility and associated grower relationships. The goodwill is attributable to the operation’s strong market position in the
         Ōpōtiki, East Cape and Gisborne regions, and synergies expected to arise from adding an extra post harvest facility to the Seeka Group. The
         goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
         Acquisition-related costs of $0.47m are included in administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $1.61m was provided in relation to differences between
         tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets. Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the disclosed fair values of
         assets and liabilities. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the acquisition date.
         Seeka has identified and updated the fair values of assets and liabilities for the crystallisation of expense provisions made in the initial fair values as
         disclosed in June 2021 and the tax implications arising as a result. The net impact was a reduction of initially disclosed goodwill by $2.11m.

         Acquisition through amalgamation of Orangewood Limited (Orangewood)
         During the year the Group amalgamated Orangewood, an integrated kiwifruit and avocado post harvest and orchard management business based
         in Kerikeri, Far North District, New Zealand, into a newly formed 100% owned subsidiary of Seeka Limited, being Northland Horticulture Limited.
         Orangewood shares were cancelled with each share being exchanged for 0.663 shares in Seeka and $1.35 cash. Seeka shares were issued based
         on a price of $5.33 per Seeka share (equal to the VWAP of shares traded over 10 business days, finishing on 13 September 2021, with all fractions
         of Seeka shares rounded up to the next whole number).
         The purchase was settled on 22 November 2021 for a purchase consideration of $4.66m by the issue of 639,302 ordinary shares in Seeka Limited
         at a market price of $5.25 on the settlement date of 22 November 2021, being the market price on the acquisition date as per NZ IFRS 3, and a
         cash consideration of $1.30m. The change in the share price on acquisition date had the impact of decreasing goodwill by $0.05m.
         Orangewood has contributed $0.33m of revenue and $0.21m of net loss before tax to the Group for the period 22 November to 31 December
         2021. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021, Orangewood would have contributed $17.99m of revenue and $0.16m of net profit before
         tax for the 12 months ended 31 December 2021. These calculations are not significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies between
         the Group and the acquired subsidiary, and no significant additional depreciation would have been charged if fair value adjustments to property,
         plant and equipment had applied from 1 January 2021, including consequential tax effects.
         The following table details the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.

         The fair value of acquired current trade receivables, within trade and other receivables, is $1.55m. There is no loss allowance recognised on
         acquisition. The goodwill of $0.62m is allocated to the Northland post harvest cash generating unit as the primary purpose of the amalgamation
         was to obtain the packhouse facility and increase the Group's presence in the desirable Far North District. The goodwill is attributable to the
         operation’s market position in the region and synergies expected to arise after adding the business into the corporate structure of the larger Seeka
         Group. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired in the foreseeable future and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
         Acquisition-related costs of $0.37m are included in overhead expenses. Deferred tax of $0.25m has been provided in relation to differences
         between tax written down values and the fair value of certain assets.
         Seeka has 12 months from the acquisition date to reassess the fair values of the assets and liabilities disclosed above if more information comes
         to light that suggests the values differ. In particular, any liabilities are expected to be crystallised and quantified within the 12 months from the
         acquisition date.

         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The fair values of assets are subject to estimates and judgement. Seeka engaged Telfer Young to complete an independent valuation of the land and
         buildings at the acquisition dates. The remaining property, plant and equipment was assessed on a depreciated historical cost basis, as well as a
         physical stocktake and a comparison to similar Seeka-owned assets. The Group assessed that any intangible asset that exists for grower relationships

effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

         The cash flow hedge reserve records increases and decreases on the revaluation of derivative financial instruments.
         The water share revaluation reserve records increases and decreases on the revaluation of Seeka's owned permanent water shares in Victoria Australia.
         The land and buildings revaluation reserve records increments and decrements on the revaluation of land and buildings.
         The foreign currency translation reserve records foreign currency translation differences of Group entity results and financial position. The amounts
         are accumulated in other comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
         The foreign currency revaluation reserve records unrealised gains and losses on Group assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies.
         The share reserve records the value of option benefits recognised on the Group's grower loyalty and employee share schemes as detailed in this note.
         The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
         – An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
         – An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
         The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust
         deed established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
         Employee share scheme
         Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
         are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
         benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
         employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
         At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
         trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
         do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the sale of shares are used
         to repay the debt owed to the Company.
         The following table details movement in the share reserve relating to the employee share scheme.

                                                                                                                                      2021             2020

         At balance date the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted to employees and remain outstanding under the scheme was
         593,998 (Dec 2020 - 689,008), representing 1.48% (Dec 2020 - 2.14%) of the shares of the Company on issue at that date.
         Grower loyalty share scheme
         Under the grower loyalty share schemes, shares are issued to a share trust in return for a debt owned back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
         growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
         Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvest seasons, with the final harvest season
         being the avocado harvest season ending 31 March 2022. The option benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period.
         At the end of the vesting period the grower has an option to either settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred
         to them, or to not have the shares transferred to them, whereby any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The
         proceeds from the shares that vest or from the sale of shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.
         In September 2021, the three-season supply commitment period for kiwifruit and kiwiberry growers ended, and 1,917,165 shares vested. 144,638
         shares issued to avocado growers remain in the scheme and vest at the completion of the 2021/22 avocado harvest.
         The following table details the movement in the grower loyalty share scheme.

For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust on behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.
The following table details inputs to the Black Scholes pricing model, used to value the cost of the share schemes to the Group.

         The 61,498 relinquished shares under the May 2016 share scheme, held by the Share Trustee, still remain outstanding as the share trustee has yet
         to release these on the market.

         During the year no shares were issued under a rights issue for shares held in the employee share scheme (Dec 2020 - Nil) .



         Accounting policies
         The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement of financial
         performance with a corresponding increase in the share reserve. For the Grower Loyalty Share Scheme (GLSS), the fair value of the grower loyalty
         received in exchange for the grant of the option is recognised as a discount against revenue in the statement of financial performance with a
         corresponding increase in share reserve. The fair value is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, calculated using the Black
         Scholes pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
         When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those shares is transferred to retained earnings.
         Employee share scheme shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average Price
         (VWAP) calculation of the Company's shares during the period prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with further shares
         if that issue would result in the ESS having an interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital.
         Shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the debt
         between ESS and GLSS and the Group on behalf of the employee of the grower.
         Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited to share capital when payment for the shares is received.
         The ESS and GLSS have a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated to employees and growers. Annually the Group reviews the ESS scheme and
         decides upon the allocation of further shares and the price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS and GLSS are appointed for
         an unspecified term and may be removed by the Company at any time.




         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The initial fair values of the employee share scheme and grower loyalty share scheme require estimates to be made of expected price volatility and
         the risk free rate as detailed in this note.

         Dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend
         reinvestment plan. Cash dividend payments made to and on behalf of shareholders during the year were $11.72m (Dec 2020 - $2.73m), including
         the dividend declared in December 2020 and paid in January 2021.
         On 16 December 2020, the directors declared a fully-imputed special dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend was paid 27 January 2021 to those
         shareholders on the register at 5pm on 24 December 2020. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with a 2% discount to the strike price. The
         Board declared the special dividend following the stronger than expected earnings in 2020 due to tight financial management and the settled sale
         and lease back of part of the Australian kiwifruit orchard portfolio.
         During the year, the dividends declared and paid in 2020 were reviewed and amended for the NRWT on dividends paid to international
         shareholders, resulting in an adjustment of $0.08m.
         On 25 February 2021, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend was paid 30 March 2021 to those
         shareholders on the register at 5pm on 5 March 2021. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with a 2% discount to the strike price.
         On 18 August 2021, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend was paid 13 October 2021 to those
         shareholders on the register at 5pm on 20 September 2021. The dividend reinvestment plan applied with a 2% discount to the strike price.
         On 20 January 2022, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend will be paid 23 February 2022 to those
         shareholders on the register at 5pm on 28 January 2022. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price.



         Accounting policies
         Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the period but not distributed at balance date.

unlisted securities are revalued at balance date. All other unlisted securities are currently held at cost less impairment as it reasonably represents

statement of comprehensive income to the extent of any related reserve available and then through the statement of financial performance.

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the voting rights in
the entity or exercising significant influence via directors on the Board.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost.
The Group's share of associates profits or losses are recognised in the statement of financial performance and the carrying amount of the investment in
the statement of financial position.
Dividends or distributions received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

The Apanui Road Joint Venture investment is considered a joint operation based on the following:
– There is equal voting rights and influence;
– There is no investment vehicle that separates it from the parties to the arrangement; and,
– The legal form and contractual arrangements through which the investee operates give the parties rights to the individual assets and liabilities
  of the investee (rather than the net assets as a whole).
The orchards of Apanui Road Orchards Joint Venture have a finite life, are carried at their fair value and are included in the consolidated financial
statements.



Accounting policies
Investment in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and
obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
Joint operations
The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate headings.
Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the statement of financial position.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

                                                                                                                              2021            2020

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings times
interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position as
investment in shares and water shares within intangible assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities, only
some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial performance
whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance is available. When no such reserve exists, any related loss is processed directly in the statement
of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.

                        To the shareholders of Seeka Limited


                        Our opinion

                        Basis for opinion
                        We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs
                        (NZ)) and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are
                        further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our
                        report.
                        We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
                        for our opinion.

                        Board and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International

                        has not impaired our independence as auditor of the Group.
                        Key audit matters
                        Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in
                        our audit of the financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context
                        of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
                        provide a separate opinion on these matters.

          Our audit approach

          Overview
                                          Overall group materiality: $2,630,000, which represents
                                          approximately 0.85% of revenue.
                                          We chose revenue as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the
                                          benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most
                                          commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted
                                          benchmark. The Group operates in a high-volume low margin
                                          industry where net profit is not representative of the scale of the
                                          Group.
                                          Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement, we:
                                          ●   Selected two entities for full scope audits
                                          ●   Performed specified audit procedures and analytical review
                                              procedures on the remaining entities
                                          As reported above, we have three key audit matters, being:
                                          ●   Accounting for the acquisition of Ōpōtiki Packaging and Cool
                                              Storage Limited (OPAC)
                                          ●   Valuation of land and buildings
                                          ●   Goodwill impairment tests

                        As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material
                        misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made
                        subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
                        making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits,
                        we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other
                        matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material
                        misstatement due to fraud.
                        Materiality
                        The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain
                        reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
                        Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in
                        aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
                        the basis of the financial statements.
                        Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
                        including the overall Group materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out above. These,
                        together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit, the nature,
                        timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually
                        and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.
                        How we tailored our group audit scope
                        We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion
                        on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting
                        processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
                        The materiality levels applied in the full scope audits of the New Zealand and Australian businesses
                        were calculated by reference to a portion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the
                        business concerned (New Zealand), or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes
                        where the statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation (Australia).
                        Other information
                        The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
                        information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our
                        auditor's report thereon.
                        Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
                        any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon.
                        In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
                        information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
                        financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
                        misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to
                        the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
                        information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
                        Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
                        The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of
                        the financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as the
                        Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
                        material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

          In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
          continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
          going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease
          operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
          Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
          Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements, as a
          whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
          report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
          guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always detect a
          material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
          material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
          economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
          A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the
          External Reporting Board’s website at:
          https://www.xrb.govt.nz/assurance-standards/auditors-responsibilities/audit-report-1/
          This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
          Who we report to
          This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit work has been
          undertaken so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
          report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
          responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s shareholders, as a body, for our
          audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.

        Governance




         Corporate governance statement
         As at 31 December 2021
         At Seeka, we conduct our business safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best outcomes for our
         growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.

         Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the recommendations in the NZX Corporate
         Governance Code, 10 December 2020 (the Code). Our practices are set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews
         Seeka's corporate governance structures against the eight principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures
         substantially meet Code recommendations. Any exceptions are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 86 of this annual report.

         Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.

         The Board approved this governance statement on 18 February 2022.



         Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
         “Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
         followed throughout the organisation.”

         Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
         connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
         that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.

         Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”

         Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are promoted
         to staff each year including at staff meetings. The code outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and
         model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”

         The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:

           • Conflicts of interest

           • Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property

           • Conduct, valuing individuals' differences and respecting all stakeholders

           • Dealing with gifts or gratuities

           • Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing

           • Compliance with laws and Seeka policies

           • Managing breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics

         Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy that applies to the Seeka team of directors, officers, senior managers and all employees, that prohibits
         team members from direct or indirect dealing in Seeka financial products when holding inside information, plus a duty of confidentiality that protects
         the dissemination and use of confidential company information.

         The Insider Trading Policy defines black-out periods during which restricted persons (defined below) are prohibited from trading in Seeka shares
         unless provided with a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to, and finishes the first trading day after, key
         events; being the half-year and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares.

         Restricted persons includes all directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts
         and companies controlled by such persons, and advisors. The policy also specifies that Seeka team members should not engage in short-term trading.

         Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chair of the Board, and the chair must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.

         No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.



         Principle 2. Board composition and performance
         “To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”

         Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interests of the company, to deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board Charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the duties
and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:
  • Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards
  • Establishing corporate objectives and strategies
  • Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies
  • Overseeing high standards of ethical behaviour
  • Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance
  • Managing risk to Seeka’s business
  • Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication

The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.


Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth
to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings for Board succession planning. On 1 September 2021, an eighth director Robert Farron was
appointed to the Board. Robert Farron will offer himself for election at the 2022 annual shareholders meeting and John Burke and Amiel Diaz will
retire, at which point the Board will have six directors.

Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at
least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between governance and management, all directors are non-executive
and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.

Seeka’s Board is led by the independent chair Fred Hutchings. Non-independent director Amiel Diaz is the only director residing overseas.

The following table summarises director qualifications, skills and experience.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.

Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;
  • Amiel Diaz (retiring April 2022), representative of Seeka’s shareholder Sumifru Singapore Pte Limited, and
  • Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chair of the Ngai Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit
    grower supplying Seeka.

As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors have extensive
experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their extensive interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are considered non-
independent directors;
  • Martyn Brick
  • John Burke (retiring April 2022), and
  • Ratahi Cross

        Governance




         The Board has four independent directors;

           • Fred Hutchings, Board chair and remuneration committee chair

           • Ashley Waugh, audit and risk committee chair,

           • Cecilia Tarrant, sustainability committee chair, and

           • Robert Farron (appointed 1 September 2021)


         Director appointments and induction
         As required, the chair establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
         complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
         annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
         to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.

         Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the Group’s
         strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
         Board.

         The chair undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the nominations
         committee and external advisors.

         While there is no maximum term, the Board annually reviews director length of service and any potential impact on director independence. When the
         Board recommends the re-election of a director whom has served longer than 12 years, they will explain to shareholders their rationale for supporting
         re-election.

         At the April 2022 annual shareholders meeting, Amiel Diaz having served 12 years as a director, will retire by rotation and has not offered himself for
         re-election, and John Burke, having served ten years as a director, will retire.


         Director profiles
         Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 87 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
         director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 89 of this annual report.


         Diversity
         Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
         understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.

         The Board works to optimise diversity across directors, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity in culture
         and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key clients,
         creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns. Notably Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is a lecturer
         in Māori history, Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia, and Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural
         backgrounds.

         background, religion, marital status, culture, disability, economic background, education, language, physical appearance and sexual orientation.

Professional development
Directors are supported to undertake professional development through individual training and by attending relevant courses.


Evaluation of board, committee and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chair undertakes an annual review of Board, committee and director performance. The chair's 2021 review found
that the Board, committees and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified by the Board
Charter.



Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”

The Board has established three permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.

All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the sustainability, remuneration and nominations committee charters biennially and the audit and risk committee charter annually.


Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board, except during succession planning when an eighth director may be appointed until the
next annual shareholders meeting, at which point the Board reverts to seven directors. To provide effective and transparent committee governance,
while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent director, with
committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill set. The audit and risk committee
charter specifies a majority of independent directors.

The current standing committees are:

        Governance




         In the event of a takeover offer, the Board Charter provides for the formation of an ad-hoc initial response committee and an independent takeover
         response committee to enact the procedures and protocols of the Board's Takeover Response Manual.

         To date there has been no need to convene an initial response committee meeting or form an independent takeover response committee.

         While the Board considers the current range of committees comprehensively manages the governance of Seeka’s business, and provides the best
         outcomes for shareholders and other stakeholders, the Board Charter allows ad-hoc committees to be formed as required to aid Board decision
         making.

         Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
         “The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”

         Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
         environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a mid-
         year performance update, along with regular operational updates to growers.

         Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
         chair of the Board, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for
         identifying material information between Board meetings. At every Board meeting the Board considers whether its deliberations and decisions trigger
         a need for a disclosure to the NZX.

         As stewards of more than 400 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and international
         guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P standard for good
         agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food. See www.globalgap.org.

         Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural

         welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.

         In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit returns;
         kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
         Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.

Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual financial statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides management
support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational performance for their fruit.

Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. Seeka also considers environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any environmental factors that may
materially affect operations.

Seeka has a sustainability committee to provide strategic guidance on Seeka's sustainability framework, targets, measures and performance. Seeka
is working to measure and improve our environmental performance and in our 2021 interim report we published the Group's carbon footprint for
2019. We know our orcharding and supply chain operations influence our environment, and we are actively addressing the risks and opportunities
of climate change. The sustainability committee provides guidance to the Seeka Agile Sustainability Team (SAST). Drawing together staff who
are passionate about sustainability from all areas of our operations, and working with external advisors, Seeka's sustainability team is working
to integrate sustainability into the hearts and minds of our employees and deliver projects that reduce Seeka’s environmental footprint. Seeka is
committed to annually reporting our sustainability initiatives and have engaged Toitu Envirocare to independently verify our environmental footprint
calculations. Seeka's third annual Sustainability report is included in this document.


Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”


Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chair uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration
within a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in
April 2021, when the pool limit was set at $530,000 per annum. During the year, R Farron was appointed to the Board and due to the increase in the
number of directors the total fees paid exceeded the pool limit by $5,833, as permitted under NZX Rule 2.11

Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according to expected time commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board.
Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and receive no performance or retirement benefits. Directors are encouraged but not required to
own Seeka shares. Director shareholdings are disclosed on page 90.

The following table reports the annual allocation of the pool at the date of this report, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. No other
benefits were provided to directors during the year.

Additional fees for chairing the sustainability, remuneration or nominations committees are not currently paid.


Chief executive officer remuneration
The review of the chief executive’s remuneration is undertaken by the remuneration committee with the remuneration package the responsibility of
the Board. Michael Franks was appointed chief executive in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual remuneration that covers base
salary, vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.

The following table reports chief executive remuneration for 2021.

                                                                                                               FY21 annual

        Governance




         Performance incentive

         The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 73% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set by the Board,
         including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For FY21, the chief executive officer earned a $470,063
         performance incentive (94% of the possible payable incentive.) This incentive was paid in December 2021 (FY20 - $388,988, paid early 2021).

         Employee share scheme

         At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated April 2019 at $4.76 per share under the 2019 employee share scheme. These shares
         vest 2022.



         Principle 6. Risk management
         “Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
         that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”

         The Board considers risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
         optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific
         focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.

         While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
         and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
         balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
         Principles and Guidelines.

         Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
         performance against budget and forecasts.

         The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian produce handling
         and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia (when practicable with regard to Covid-19 travel restrictions)
         to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.

         The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated
         with being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing
         revenue from more points along the value chain.

         Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post harvest processing and fruit handling facilities.

         The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB; Halyomorpha halys) remains one of the top pests of concern for New Zealand's horticultural industry. A
         native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and accidentally introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s, adult BMSB feed on fruit and make them
         unmarketable. The Ministry of Primary Industries is working with industry groups along with the public to prevent the unintended import of BMSB,
         including eradication protocols if BMSB are detected in New Zealand. Seeka personnel and supplying growers are informed on how to identify BMSB
         and the immediate actions to be undertaken if the pest is found.

         Communicable diseases are a risk to labour availability, food safety and market access. Seeka works with industry bodies, the Government,
         community agencies and international groups to secure reliable labour. Risk to food safety and market access is managed through Seeka's full
         orchard-to-market track and trace service, which includes a register of all orchard visits and finger-scanner access to post harvest facilities. Tracing
         from point of origin to point of sale allows Seeka to manage risk from contagion and ensures our markets can have confidence in the safety of our
         supply chain and our products. Seeka's response to the communicable disease Covid-19 is detailed in the following health and safety section.


         Health and safety
         The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
         Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
         risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.

         Seeka has a Covid-19 response committee to protect our people and prepare our business. We have worked with health professionals, secured
         personal protective equipment, and used social distancing protocols to mitigate risk and keep our people safe as we deliver an essential service. This
         includes using operational “bubbles”, onsite personnel temperature logging, touchless signing in, the provision of personal protective equipment, two-
         metre screening, enlarged break areas, 24-hour cleaning and remote management.

         Seeka is part of a community effort that kept our whānau safe as collectively we worked to harvest our growers' crops and supply the world with safe,
         healthy food. This included operating an essential service from Auckland New Zealand and Victoria Australia, during prolonged periods of community
         lockdown in FY21.

         Our people work in multiple, complex environments, and we focus on building safety into everything we do. This included instilling Seeka's safety
         culture as we amalgamated OPAC and Orangewood in FY21. Over the full year, the Group employed more than 4700 people, with Group salary and
         wages equating to 1915 full time equivalents.

2. Permanently disabled or requiring immediate in-patient hospitalisation.



Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”

Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the markets
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.

The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit
process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk committee:
  • Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and

  • Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.

For FY21, Troy Florence of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for the Group. Troy replaced Pip Cameron of PwC who completed
her five-year term as Seeka’s Auditor at the end of FY20.

PwC has confirmed its independence to the audit and risk committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the reporting period.
PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.

In FY21, PwC was paid $493,000 for audit fees and expenses, and $261,000 for tax compliance, consulting, planning, structuring and due diligence,
tax pooling and debt covenant compliance certificate agreed upon procedures.

To further increase auditor independence, in FY21, Seeka appointed BDO as its tax compliance agent.

Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
external audit findings.

Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated financial audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s financial systems.
Directors also pay attention to matters raised by PwC, the external auditor.



Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”

Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering excellence to all stakeholders.

The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:
  • Annual and interim reports
  • Market announcements
  • Annual shareholder meeting
  • Mid-year stakeholder meeting
  • Ad-hoc investor presentations
  • Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type
  • Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors
  • Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update via the online portal, or where
practicable in person, where they can raise matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which
affect Seeka at the annual shareholder meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the
company’s auditor PwC, on a one share, one vote principle.

         Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar
         Link Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. Notices of shareholder meetings are posted on the NZX website and Seeka's website. Where
         circumstances allow, Seeka sends notices of shareholder meetings at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements
         can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.

         When raising new capital, when practical the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company on a pro
         rata basis so they can maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.

         Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK

         Remuneration includes key performance indicator payments. Remuneration by the Group’s Australian subsidiary Seeka Australia in Australian dollars
         was converted to New Zealand dollars using the average exchange rate for the year. The impact of movements in exchange rates from FY20 to FY21
         was reviewed and would not have significantly changed the employee remuneration disclosure.


         Employee share scheme
         As part of their employment benefits, eligible permanent employees are invited to participate in Seeka’s employee share ownership scheme.

         In March 2019, offers under Seeka's employee share ownership scheme were made and 568,000 shares were allocated to permanent employees at
         $4.76 per share on 10 April 2019. The shares vest FY22.
