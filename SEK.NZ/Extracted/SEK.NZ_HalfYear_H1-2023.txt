                Chair and Chief Executive's report

                New Zealand's kiwifruit industry had a very tough 2023 harvest with low volumes and
                challenging weather. Seeka, as a large grower and operator, is not immune to these
                challenges. Seeka’s revenue for the 6 months ended 30 June 2023 was $212.7 million,
                down from $247.3 million in the previous corresponding period to June 2022 (pcp). From
                this 14% drop in revenue, profit before tax was also lower at $13.6 million (pcp: $30.1m).
                This financial result reflects lower kiwifruit volumes harvested by Seeka and the wider New
                Zealand industry in 2023.
                Despite challenging trading conditions, Seeka progressed its strategy. The company has focussed on
                operational excellence and has delivered a timely harvest to growers, along with low fruit loss and quality
                produce to the markets. New automation commissioned in 2023 delivered on expectations, which along
                with operational changes has produced better outcomes for all stakeholders.
                Seeka’s in-house teams have improved their reporting systems to our operational decision makers. New
                picking processes, introduced to overcome industry quality issues in 2022, also worked well.
                Operationally the business is set to handle the anticipated volume rebound in 2024.
                Seeka has focussed on reducing costs, and all segments of the business were reviewed to create a
                leaner organisation. The company remains focussed on removing inefficiencies in the supply chain, and
                innovatively, Seeka has implemented a captive insurance structure which places more cover directly to the
                international markets to help contain the ongoing increases in insurance costs.
                The company has focussed on prudent debt management, slowing capital expenditure and reducing forward
                capital expenditure to within depreciation levels. Seeka engaged with its banking syndicate and has their
                continuing support, including their waiver of two banking covenants for the 2023 test period. The company
                continues to review its asset mix and investigate opportunities to sell and lease back some facilities.

      Challenging growing conditions
      2023 was a difficult season across the horticultural sector. Kiwifruit growers faced many challenges in a
      tight labour environment. Heavy rains and a warm winter contributed to an indifferent budbreak, particularly
      in Northland and the Te Kaha regions. A heavy frost on 7 October 2022 impacted many orchards right
      across our growing regions, with a number devastated. Continual rain through the Christmas period was
      exacerbated by Cyclone Hale and Cyclone Gabrielle, which caused severe damage in the Hawke’s Bay and
      Tairāwhiti Gisborne regions. Thankfully, all our people and growers were safe; quite remarkable given the
      extent of the flooding and damage.
      On 10 and 11 May, significant hail hit the Te Puke region, and while some orchards only experienced light
      damage, others suffered total loss. This hail event further lowered crop volumes. Hail-damaged lines also
      decrease packhouse efficiency and margins as additional grading staff are required to remove damaged fruit
      as Seeka works to provide the best possible outcomes for impacted growers.
      With its warm, moist growing conditions, harvest 2023 also produced SunGold kiwifruit with below
      normal dry matter. This occurred in a year when Zespri had increased dry matter maturity thresholds as a
      mechanism to improve the consumer taste experience. This convergence resulted in a significant volume of
      quality SunGold kiwifruit not being packed for export. This further lowered returns to our orchard and post
      harvest operations.
      SeekaFresh, our wholesaling and produce distribution business, continues to rebuild after two years of
      Covid-19 restrictions. The avocado programme, whilst challenging, delivered market-leading returns to our
      growers. The kiwiberry programme had an excellent season and achieved record export returns.
      Many of the issues faced in New Zealand were mirrored in Australia with hail and flooding in the
      Shepparton region affecting 2023 crop volumes.

      Operational excellence
      Operationally, within a very challenging harvest, Seeka has delivered an excellent harvest for growers and
      Zespri. The fruit Seeka delivered to the market in 2023 is excellent; our initiatives to deliver quality fruit and
      performance were successful. Onshore fruit loss is extremely low and our current offshore fruit loss is also
      low. The company remains obsessed with quality.
      The new automated packing machine at KKP performed well and has delivered the anticipated throughput
      and capacity gains. Automation upgrades at both Oakside and Seeka Gisborne have also enhanced capacity
      and throughput.
      Our mix of automated and manual packlines gives Seeka the flexibility to efficiently handle a harvest that
      includes fruit from hail or water damaged orchards. Quality lines can be quickly and efficiently processed
      on Seeka’s highly automated packlines, while crop from damaged orchards can be cared for with intensive
      manual grading. This mix of packing technology allows Seeka to provide a timely harvest to supplying
      growers.
      While it is too early to make a reliable prediction on the 2024 crop, the current cold winter conditions are
      favourable for kiwifruit growth and are in stark contrast to the previous year’s winter.

                Finance renewal
                Prudently, Seeka has suspended dividends and reduced capital expenditure to maintenance levels.
                The company engaged with our banking syndicate early in the scheduled banking renewal process,
                and they have supported Seeka to provide banking certainty with the syndicate waiving two of the
                banking covenants for the current financial year and approving negotiated covenants for 2024. A
                new Sustainability-Linked Loan was added to the suite of banking facilities which rewards Seeka
                should it achieve set sustainability targets, with penalties if they are not met.
                The company has also targeted operational and overhead cost reduction in the first six months of
                2023, with these initiatives set to achieve forward savings of $3 million per annum.

                Capacity
                In recent years Seeka has made significant investments in capacity and automation at KKP, Oakside,
                Seeka Gisborne and Transcool, which has lifted our New Zealand kiwifruit capacity to more than 50
                million trays in a “normal” growing season. This investment means that Seeka can, and is, reducing
                capital expenditure to within annual depreciation, with a focus on ensuring our assets are fully
                maintained and Seeka’s people and stakeholders enjoy a safe environment. To further lift efficiency,
                automation upgrades continue at Oakside and Transpack in preparation for harvest 2024.
                Seeka continues to invest in quality accommodation for seasonal workers. New accommodation
                facilities have been leased in the Te Puke region and Seeka has built a new accommodation facility at
                Sharp Road Aongatete which it intends to sell and lease back.

                Forward focus
                Your company has been through an extended period of challenges with Covid-19 and weather events.
                Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, and the volumes to Seeka's New Zealand post harvest fell
                29% in 2023 to 29.8 million class 1 trays, compared to 42.0 million in 2022.
                The weather pattern has recently changed from La Niña to El Niño, and the current winter conditions
                are cold and dry; a stark contrast to last year.
                The challenges of quality have been managed and the 2023 selling season is going well.
                Seeka has turned its attention to planning for a resurgence in kiwifruit volumes and a return to
                profitability in 2024.
                We thank our people, stakeholders and growers for their hard work and continuing support.

         Basis of preparation
        This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the consolidated interim financial statements for the half
        year reporting period ended 30 June 2023. Accounting policies which are limited to a specific note are described in that note.

         Reporting entity and statutory base
         The interim financial statements presented are those of the consolidated Seeka group. Seeka Limited is referred to as Seeka Limited or the
         Company. The group is referred to as the Group, Seeka, or Seeka Group.
         Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and a Financial Markets Conduct (FMC)
         Reporting Entity for the purposes of the FMC Act 2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the NZX main board equity
         security market (NZX Main Board).

         Nature of operations
         Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.
         In New Zealand the Group provides orchard management, orchard leasing, post harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit, avocado,
         citrus, berry, persimmon, and kiwiberry industries. Seeka manufactures and sells the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product range along with
         avocado oil. The Group also provides retail and ripening services for imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale market.
         In Australia, Seeka owns, leases and operates orchards and associated post harvest assets, making the Group the largest producer and supplier of
         Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of European pears, plus other fruits, including plums and jujube dates.

         Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
         Group consolidated interim financial statements for the half year reporting period ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance
         with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (NZ GAAP) and comply with the New Zealand International Financial Reporting
         Standards (NZ IFRS) and other reporting standards as applicable to profit-oriented entities. Specifically, Group interim financial statements have
         been prepared in accordance with NZ IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. This consolidated interim financial information does not include all
         of the information required for the full annual audited financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial
         statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS.
         The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
         The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) on 23 August 2023. The Directors do not have the authority to
         amend the financial statements after issue.

         Summary of significant accounting policies
         Other than detailed above, the accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the annual audited financial statements for the year ended
         31 December 2022, as described in those annual financial statements.
         Where a change in the presentational format of the financial statements has been made during the period, comparative figures have been
         restated accordingly.

         Going concern assumption
         The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
         The 2023 New Zealand kiwifruit harvest was impacted by a number of adverse weather events, including a severe frost on 7 October 2022,
         cyclones in January and February 2023, and hail in May 2023. Similarly, Australia faced severe flooding and hail events during the same period.
         These weather events have resulted in a significant reduction of kiwifruit volumes in New Zealand and Australia.
         The Group has a forecast net loss before tax between $20m and $25m for the 12 months ending 31 December 2023. Seeka has undertaken cost
         containment measures and is progressively reviewing and restructuring business units, as well as limiting capital expenditure.
         The Group compares the carrying amount of net assets with the market capitalisation value at each balance date. The share price at 30 June 2023
         was $2.61, equating to a market capitalisation of $109.59m. This market value excludes any control premium and may not reflect the value of
         Group net assets. The carrying amount of Group net assets at 30 June 2023 was $272.58m ($6.49 net assets per share).
         Seeka has engaged with its banking syndicate and has refinanced its banking facilities at 30 June 2023 into a Sustainability-Linked Loan facility of
         NZD$201m. The facilities have extended maturity dates, with 61% extended to 31 January 2025 and the remainder extended to 31 January 2026.
         As part of the refinancing, Seeka has obtained a waiver for the net leverage ratio and interest cover ratio for the 30 June 2023 and 31 December
         2023 test periods, see note 12.
         Seeka’s outlook is vulnerable to the weather during key growing periods. However, an anticipated El Ninò weather pattern provides a more
         positive outlook. The longer term impacts of climate change are being considered and Seeka intends to mitigate these risks through regional
         diversification, growing techniques, and taking an innovative approach to all parts of the supply chain.
         The Group has performed impairment testing across all its operating CGUs. These tests are outlined in note 6.
         The outlook for the Group and the kiwifruit industry is for increasing volumes, which is supported by the SunGold and Zespri RubyRed licences
         that have been released by Zespri, and bought by growers to develop new kiwifruit orchards.
         The Directors have considered the economic environment, the forward outlook for the kiwifruit industry, the results of the value in use
         calculations, and the forecast covenant compliance to determine that the going concern assumption is able to be supported.

Seasonal nature of Group operations
Seeka's core business is providing supply chain services to New Zealand and Australia's horticulture industries. A high proportion of
Group revenue is generated and cost of sales incurred in the autumn when produce is harvested and prepared for market. Correspondingly,
approximately 80% to 100% of Group gross profit is recorded in the interim report. Seasonal fluctuations impact the timing of gross profit,
particularly the amount and quality of kiwifruit inventory remaining in store at 30 June.

Goods and services tax (GST)
The statement of financial performance and statement of comprehensive income have been prepared so that all components are stated exclusive
of GST. All items in the statement of financial position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and payables, which include GST
invoiced.

Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the entity
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and are effective that are expected to have a significant impact
on the Group.

         Performance
         This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

         1. Segment information
         The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in business activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a manner
         consistent with the internal reports provided to the chief decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the allocation of resources
         alongside operational outcomes, such as EBITDA and EBIT, and are responsible for setting strategic direction.
         The Group has five operating segments:
         – Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the retail sector.
         – A single Australian operating segment covers the integrated supply chain service for the Group’s Australian-grown fruit.
         Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs and other
         income from the sale of assets recorded in the statement of profit or loss are allocated to all other segments. Transactions between segments are
         conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated on consolidation.
         Segment information is prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

         New Zealand segments
         Orchard operations
         The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.
         The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and kiwiberry crops from:
         – Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts) whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the orchard
           owners.
         – Long term leased land which the Group has developed into productive orchards, pays all development and production costs, owns all crops for
           the term of the lease, and shares profit with the landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
         – Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
         Post harvest operations
         The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado, citrus, berry, and persimmon industries. This includes all crops from the
         Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from independent orchard owners.
         Retail service operations
         The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This includes
         fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and ripening
         services for imported fruit, operates a wholesale market, and the post harvest operations relating to kiwiberry.
         Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi Crush, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and hospitals, along
         with post harvest services for kiwiberry.
         All other segments - New Zealand
         This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower services and overhead sections recorded in the statement of profit or loss and
         impairment and revaluations of other assets not attributed directly to any other segment. It also includes the gain on sale from assets that had
         been classified as held for sale.

         Australian operations
         The Group grows, provides post harvest services, and retails all produce from orchards the Group owns or leases in Australia. The main products
         are kiwifruit, nashi pears and European pears, which are primarily sold in Australia.




         EBITDA and EBIT
         EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
         reflects operating cash flow generation.
         EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
         Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
         information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors and
         management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expense associated with
         debt (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large investments in fixed and leased

         Turnover
         The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
         services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
         where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

         At 30 June 2023, 16.6 hectares of Northland orchards (Jun 2022 - 29.4 hectares) and nil hectares of Ōpōtiki orchards (Jun 2022 - 3.5 hectares)
         owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. No growing costs have been attributed to these remaining orchards at 30 June 2023 as they are
         valued on a crop-off basis.
         Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
         continuing use. This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition,
         and the Group is committed to the sale and expects it to be completed within one year from the date of classification. The accounting standard
         allows for the period to extend past 12 months if the circumstances causing the delay are out of Seeka's control. As at 30 June 2023 one orchard
         of 13.5 hectares (Jun 2022 - one orchard of 13.5 hectares) has taken longer than 12 months to find a willing buyer, however Seeka remains
         committed to selling the property and a sale is anticipated within the next 12 months. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of
         the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.


         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The Group used judgement to recognise the remaining orchards as held for sale, despite one being held for sale for greater than 12 months.
         This judgement is based on the ability to obtain a buyer for the assets classified as held for sale. This is impacted by external real estate market forces
         and changes to this estimate may result in the balance being reclassified to a non-current asset.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to
the appropriate asset class. At 30 June 2023 the assets under construction relate to Sharp Road RSE accommodation $3.40m, and investment in
automation at Seeka Gisborne $3.93m.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations were undertaken by CBRE Limited,
independent registered valuer.
In Australia valuations were undertaken by Opteon (Goulburn North East Vic) Pty Ltd, independent valuers based in Victoria, Australia. All
Australian land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2022.
As at 30 June 2023 the directors believe there are indicators that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings differs materially
from their fair value. As a consequence, the Group has performed a desktop fair value calculation, adjusting the market capitalisation and market
rental rates for the circumstances present at 30 June 2023, and has calculated a reduction in the valuation of $12.8m. This is related to land and
buildings, and has been applied against the revaluation reserve accounts for all properties apart from one property, which did not have revaluation
reserves and was recorded in the statement of profit and loss.
Impairment
In the six months to June 2023, $0.43m of hail netting assets in Australia, and $0.12m of fixed electrical assets were impaired. In the six months
ended June 2022, $0.11m of assets were impaired relating to capitalised structures on a long-term-leased orchard.


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
At 30 June 2023, the Group has performed a desktop fair value calculation to determine the value of the land and buildings by adjusting the market
capitalisation and market rental rates for the conditions present at 30 June 2023, and has calculated a reduction in the value of land and buildings of
$12.8m, being a reduction in revaluation reserves of $11.8m and a loss on revaluation through the statement of profit and loss of $1.0m.
Independent valuations will be obtained at 31 December 2023 in line with the accounting policies of the Group.

         Impairment tests for goodwill
         At 30 June 2023, indicators of impairment existed, including the market capitalisation and industry circumstances as described in the Basis of
         Preparation note, and the impairment of land and buildings as outlined in note 5. In response the Group has performed impairment tests on all cash
         generating units (CGUs), in addition to CGUs with goodwill balances to ensure that future cash flows of the CGUs and the Group support the fair
         value of the assets.
         The impairment tests have been performed using a value in use calculation model. No material impairment was identified.
         The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value-in-use), with a terminal value
         beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated in this note. The
         assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit is determined based on forecast
         crop volumes, past financial performance and the Board's expectations of future market dynamics, plus the Group's five year financial plans.
         The impairment tests have incorporated the lower volumes in the 2023 harvest and a more conservative forward looking growth profile of kiwifruit
         volumes over the five years. It is anticipated that the 2024 harvest will be significantly better than the previous two years, which is a view supported
         by the industry.
         The Goodwill and asset value allocated to the post harvest CGU is supported by historical profitability, increasing volume forecasts, and forecast
         growth of the kiwifruit industry and returns. The 2022 and 2023 harvest have been impacted by lower yields. The headroom in the post harvest
         CGU has reduced, after impairing the land and buildings assets (see note 5), however there is no impairment identified as at 30 June 2023.
         The impact of climate change has been incorporated to the extent that it impacts the forecasts and considered as part of scenario planning from an
         operational capacity planning perspective. Scenario planning is being carried out across the Company to model for the impact of climate change on
         future yields.
         Seeka has a long history of adapting to the environment, such as when Psa arrived in New Zealand and the industry pivoted to the SunGold variety,
         alongside past climatic events such as droughts, hail, and floods. The business will continue to adapt to the changing environment.


         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         The goodwill impairment tests require judgement to determine the appropriate forecast cash flows and inputs into the calculations. The primary
         estimates relate to the forecast EBITDA growth rates, discount rates, WACC and terminal growth rates.

7. Biological assets - crop
Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears, other pears, cherry, avocado, and plum crops growing on leased and owned
orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.
The following table reconciles beginning balances to end balances for biological assets crop measured at fair value.

Refinancing
In the six months to 30 June 2023, Seeka has engaged with its banking syndicate and has refinanced its banking facilities into a Sustainability-
Linked Loan facility of NZD$201 million.
The facilities have extended maturity dates, with 61% extended to 31 January 2025 and the remainder extended to 31 January 2026.
As part of the refinancing, Seeka has obtained a waiver for the net leverage ratio and interest cover ratio for the 30 June 2023 and 31 December
2023 testing periods. The 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024 banking covenants have been set on a “step down” basis to enable the Group to
reach its long term covenants of 3.25x for the net leverage ratio and 2.00x for the interest cover ratio.

         13. Dividends
         In the last 12 months, no dividends were paid (prior 12 months $0.26 per share).
         As part of the refinancing, as described in note 12, the restrictions placed on dividend payments was amended from a required net leverage ratio
         not exceeding 3.75:1.00 during the period of 30 June 2023 to 29 June 2024, to a net leverage ratio not exceeding 3.25:1.00.

         established in 2019 (including funds from the vesting of the schemes).

         15. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
         The following table analyses financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as at 30 June 2023.
         The different levels are defined as:
         – Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
           Instruments in level 1 are comprised of water shares and irrigation water rights.
         – Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
         – Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
           when determining an appropriate price.
