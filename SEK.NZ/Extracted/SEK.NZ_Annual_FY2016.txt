ANNUAL REPORT
       Seeka
       Seeka is a Te Puke-headquartered, NZX-listed produce company. Our operations span New Zealand, and
       Australia through our wholly-owned subsidiary Seeka Australia Pty Limited. Kiwifruit is our foundation fruit.

       Our New Zealand operations include growing, picking, processing and dispatching kiwifruit, avocados and
       kiwiberry to key world markets. Seeka is the largest kiwifruit grower in New Zealand. Our operations take local
       produce and create premium New Zealand exports, either directly or in conjunction with Zespri; the principal
       exporter of New Zealand-grown kiwifruit.

       Seeka is also a major importer of bananas and other tropical fruits to New Zealand and provides retail services
       through its Glassﬁelds operations.

       In Australia, Seeka is the country’s largest kiwifruit grower and packer and markets Australian and imported
       Seeka New Zealand kiwifruit. Seeka is also Australia’s largest nashi grower and supplier and a large grower of
       European pears, along with smaller volumes of cherries, plums and apricots. Seeka directly markets all of its
       Australian fruit with Seeka brands sold in stores across Australia 12 months of the year.

       Seeka is extending further into food processing. In 2016 the company purchased the Kiwi Crush range of
       products to complement its small avocado oil processing operation, delivering incremental returns to growers
       and stakeholders from non-class-1 fruit. Kiwi Crush products are highly regarded in the health and hospital
       sectors, aiding people recovering through treatment processes or relieving symptoms. Seeka will open a food
       processing centre in 2017.

       The company is following a deliberate growth strategy. In 2016, Seeka revitalised its brand to reﬂect
       the company it aspires to be. Our goal is to proﬁtably grow the company and deliver wealth to our key
       stakeholders. We aspire to be inspirational leaders, independently ingenious and obsessed by quality. To be
       always safe and growing futures for all stakeholders founded on relationships, now and into the future. Our
       core brand attribute is Select Excellence; we want everyone who associates with the company to experience
       that when they select Seeka, they Select Excellence.

Report of the
Chairman and Chief Executive



Introduction
2016 was an exciting year for Seeka, one with considerable change including shortening our name to Seeka Limited as a
result of a rebranding programme that presents us in a more modern and fresh way. This annual report incorporates the
branding for the ﬁrst time.

In addition to Seeka producing a record proﬁt and delivering operational improvements, outstanding fruit handling results
were achieved for our growers and customers.

The company successfully handled record kiwifruit volumes in New Zealand, delivered leading avocado returns from
its targeted export programmes, initiated its Australian business operations and continued to develop its retail services
business centred on its tropical fruits category in New Zealand.

Our strategy of focussing on excellence in everything we do has delivered outstanding results for our stakeholders. Our
achievements are outlined in the following ﬁnancial and operational highlights.

        • Purchase of the Kiwi Crush range of products
        • Successful rebrand of Seeka
        • Major infrastructure and capacity build with coolstore and precooler expansion at two of our main sites at Main
          Road Katikati and KKP in Maketu

        • Purchase of Seeka 360 property at Young Road, Paengaroa, and initial site refurbishment for Seeka’s new headquarters



     Dividend
     The directors have declared a fully imputed dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend will be paid 24 March to those
     shareholders on the register at 5pm on 17 March, 2017. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply. This dividend
     declaration brings fully imputed dividends distributed to shareholders relating to the 2016 ﬁnancial year to $0.20 per
     share, compared to $0.19 per share relating to the 2015 ﬁnancial year.



     Shares issued
     Seeka issued 1,132,922 shares during the year:
        • 68,698 for the dividend reinvestment plan
        • 398,100 to the Seeka employee scheme — approximately 4% of company shares are held for employees under this
          scheme with the ﬁrst vesting occurring in October 2017
        • 666,124 for the ﬁnal year of the successful grower share scheme

     By helping nearly all growers become shareholders, the grower share scheme secured loyalty during the period of
     uncertainty created by Psa, with participating growers beneﬁting from Seeka's strong performance from secure crop
     volumes. In return for committing to supply Seeka over the scheme's three-year period, growers were issued 2,010,226
     shares (11.5% of Seeka's total shares) at a total issue value of $7.26m. By the end of 2016, these shares had a market value
     of $9.45m. Combined with $0.57m of dividend payments, this represents a total capital and dividend gain of $2.76m — a
     38% return to growers on the issue value.

Commentary
Seeka remains in a strong period of growth. Fuelled by increasing New Zealand kiwifruit volumes the company has
invested in growing its New Zealand capacity and improving existing infrastructure. Kiwifruit volumes increased by 17% to
32.44m trays. At the same time Seeka integrated its Australian business and set a platform for growth in that market. As a
result, the company has year-round branded produce in the Australian market. Turnover increased to $229.40m (up 24%)
and revenue to $191.32 (up 35%).

Proﬁtability continues to improve reﬂecting economies of scale. EBITDA increased by 78% to a record $24.76m.

Basic earnings per share is up to $0.65 compared to $0.29 in the pcp.

Seeka invested $43.06m in its New Zealand kiwifruit business and in orcharding, packing and fruit storage in Australia.
Investments included:
   • $16.94m developing New Zealand kiwifruit coolstore and packing infrastructure
   • $3.98m acquiring the strategic property of Seeka 360
   • $2.01m acquiring the Pukenga orchard — a strategic land bank for future post-harvest development
   • $2.36m in the ongoing rollout of plastic bins
   • $4.74m upgrading New Zealand kiwifruit packing equipment ahead of 2017
   • $9.78m upgrading other New Zealand plant, property and equipment
   • $3.25m developing Australian orchards and post harvest facilities

To ﬁnance these investments Seeka increased net debt (all interest-bearing debt less cash deposits) by $19.80m to
$72.76m while total assets grew to $197.31m.

Seeka continues to:
   • Focus on building and delivering shareholder wealth and increasing dividends. During the year the company
     successfully integrated Seeka Australia, including implementing our business systems into our Australian
     operations. At the same time the company focused on its core kiwifruit business by delivering packing and
     coolstorage capacity to process a record 32.44m trays in New Zealand and 0.66m trays in Australia, along with
     1,523 tonnes of nashi pears and 1,790 tonnes of European pears; the other major crops Seeka grows in Australia.
   • Evaluate options to handle increasing kiwifruit volumes and minimise costly investments, and strive for
     improvements that deliver leading results. The company continues to look for opportunities to innovate, expand or
     diversify to secure long-term growth and sustainable proﬁtability.
   • Focus and take advice on its ﬁnancial position and balance sheet to pursue growth opportunities.

Implementing Seeka’s strategy may result in the company undertaking value-accretive acquisitions or further expanding
geographical boundaries. Our vision remains to be “New Zealand’s Premier Produce Business”.



Outlook
Seeka advised stakeholders late 2016 that New Zealand Hayward kiwifruit volumes are forecast to be 20% to 25% down on
the previous year’s record levels. This is in line with industry-wide estimates. Partially offsetting this reduction are expected
increases in SunGold volumes and anticipated improved earnings from Seeka Australia and our retail services business. Our
early guidance is that operational earnings in 2017 may be up to 15% lower than the record levels achieved in 2016.




                                                                                                                                    5
      Seeka 2016 Annual Report




          Review of operations
          Proﬁts are up. Proﬁt after tax of $10.39m is $6.12m ahead of the pcp (+143%), reﬂecting record New Zealand kiwifruit
          volumes, successful avocado selling seasons, and the ﬁrst year of operations in Australia. In addition, Seeka settled the
          outstanding insurance claim for mitigation costs arising from excess grower fruit loss as a consequence of the 2015
          Oakside ﬁre. Taking some 18 months, the settlement resulted in a receipt of $3.63m, the associated costs of $4.04m being
          recorded in the prior period.

          While higher New Zealand kiwifruit volumes have led to better earnings, they have required signiﬁcant investment and
          Seeka increasing long-term borrowing.

          Australian operations generated a positive EBITDA. In 2016 Seeka harvested 656,000 tray equivalents of Australian
          kiwifruit, 1,523 tonnes of nashi pears and 1,790 tonnes of European pears; the three major Australian crops grown by
          Seeka. While earnings were lower than expected, they reﬂect a challenging ﬁrst growing season with Seeka learning to
          operate in the Australian business and orcharding environment. Australian operations produced an EBITDA of $1.03m.
          Seeka Australia is 100% debt ﬁnanced.

          During the year the company commenced direct marketing and selling capability in Australia for both Seeka’s Australian
          and New Zealand produce.

          Seeka’s integrated avocado service and strong export and local marketing programmes delivered a record $26.86 per
          export tray to growers for the 2015 to 2016 season with a forecast return of $24.42 per tray for the 2016 to 2017 season;
          the third year in a row Seeka has topped industry returns.

         Kiwiberry volumes increased to 62,407, up from 38,675 trays in the pcp. Volumes are expected to increase to 140,000
         trays in 2017. Good returns were delivered to growers. This is despite issues with the industry’s China phytosanitary
         protocol and the sudden closure of this key market. The industry is working to reopen the Chinese market.

         New Zealand kiwifruit volumes were up. Hayward class 1 volumes handled by post-harvest increased by 1.36m trays
         as yields reached a record average of 12,800 class 1 trays per hectare (the equivalent of 46 tonnes of fruit across all
         supplying hectares). Market share remained steady at 24.8%. Zespri SunGold volumes increased by 3.54m trays with
         market share increasing from 14% to 16%. Further growth in Zespri SunGold is anticipated as orchards continue to recover
         from Psa-V and new areas are grafted as more licenses are released by Zespri. Total New Zealand kiwifruit volumes
         handled by Seeka increased to 32.44m trays — up from 27.76m in the pcp (class 1 and 2).

         Seeka delivered growers a timely harvest and facilities were fully utilised. Disciplined and professional planning ensured
         that Seeka had the capacity to handle all growers’ fruit.

         Seeka continues to focus on infrastructure expansion and capacity planning to ensure we have adequate capacity for
         forecast volumes. While the company is pursuing innovative collaborative marketing programs that would use existing
         vacant infrastructure offshore, there is little alternative to further investment in New Zealand considering the kiwifruit
         industry’s inertia to implementing offshore handling and storage, and its minimal approach to collaborative marketing. All
         growers and stakeholders will beneﬁt from the long-overdue overhaul of this component of our industry.

    Seeka 2016 Annual Report




     Continuing post-harvest investment for New Zealand kiwifruit
     New Zealand post-harvest earnings have increased on bigger kiwifruit volumes. Assets assigned to our post-harvest
     operations increased from $83.44m to $111.72m during the year with coolstore and pre-cooling investments primarily
     at KKP in Maketu and Main Road Katikati. The anticipated volume increase will see further capacity increases at these
     sites along with additional coolstores at Transcool in Maketu. Packing machine investments also occur in 2017 with a new
     leading-edge Compac Spectrim being installed at Main Road with the current machine being relocated to an upgraded
     Peninsula packhouse in Whenuakite to handle bigger volumes from the Coromandel.

     The post-harvest division delivered EBITDA of $26.78m — up 102% on pcp. Post harvest earnings are expected to decline
     in 2017 on lower Hayward volumes.

     While annual volumes may ﬂuctuate, as anticipated in 2017, Seeka has undertaken detailed planning in anticipation of
     growing kiwifruit volumes through to 2020. Resource consents and longer lead times require Seeka to commit even earlier
     to infrastructure investment. Our ﬁrst priority is to focus on fully utilising existing sites and infrastructure.

     The company has strategically secured the Pukenga Orchard (adjoining Seeka 360) on the edge of the proposed Rangiuru
     business park for future expansion.



     Seeka Australia — Platform for growth
     Seeka undertook its ﬁrst harvest and selling season in 2016. Volumes were lower than expected reﬂecting hail and
     a challenging ﬁrst growing season. EBITDA totalled $1.03m compared to the pcp EBITDA loss of $1.38m (reﬂecting
     acquisition costs).

     Seeka grows kiwifruit, nashi, European pears (multiple varieties), apricots, plums and cherries in Australia, with operations
     being progressively rationalised to the core products of pears, nashi and kiwifruit.

     Seeka has extensively upgraded its post-harvest assets in Australia with extra coolstore capacity and a new kiwifruit
     packing machine which is expected to deliver efficiencies in 2017.

     Underlying business systems, including key safety systems have been upgraded.

     Seeka plans to expand the orcharding area and has secured additional land to develop alongside its existing bare land
     holdings. Additional water rights have been secured to ensure sufficient water resources in 2017 and beyond.

     In addition Seeka is trialling new fruit varieties for its Australian business.

Seeka is our brand
The company undertook an extensive review to revitalize its brand so it projected our company's vision, core strategy and
beliefs. This included independent insights and guidance from a renowned brand specialist. While kiwifruit remains our
foundation, our new brand Seeka better reﬂects our emerging produce business.

As part of the branding process, management and the board considered the attributes the company wants to be
recognised for in all stakeholder dealings. The six key brand attributes are:
   • Safety always
   • Founded on relationships
   • Inspirational people
   • Independently ingenious
   • Quality obsession
   • Growing futures

The Seeka brand incorporates our aspiration “Select Excellence”. It is our aspiration to be excellent, to drive excellence
in our operations, decision making and behaviours. We want the consumers of our produce, the growers who choose to
supply Seeka, and Seeka investors to know they are selecting excellence when they select Seeka.

      Seeka 360 campus — opening of new headoffice
      Seeka 360 is scheduled to open at 3pm on 30 March 2017 and all stakeholders are invited. This facility delivers a new
      grower-centric headquarters for Seeka’s international business. Based on 7.4 hectares adjacent to the Seeka-owned
      Pukenga orchard, our new headquarters is in the heart of the Maketu packing hub and close to the Oakside facility.

      Seeka’s new headquarters, expected to be completed at a total cost of $5m, will accommodate 80 staff and include
      extensive grower facilities with a 150-seat auditorium.



      The Seeka team
      Seeka people continue to be the key asset in Seeka. The company continues to reﬁne its health and safety strategy and
      systems to ensure that it exceeds legislative thresholds and keeps its people safe.

      Seeka remains committed to safety and the development of all employees; formal safety processes and policies are in
      place. Safety processes continue to be reviewed with targeted projects underway. Key operating systems for monitoring
      safety have been reviewed and reﬁned during the year and Seeka’s compliance teams have worked to ensure the
      compliance of Seeka’s contractors and suppliers.

      While seasonal labour was adequate in 2016, shortages loom. Seeka employed 460 recognised seasonal employer
      workers (RSEs) from Malaysia and the Paciﬁc Islands to complement the local workforce. We initiated innovative
      arrangements with Work and Income New Zealand to maximise work opportunities for New Zealanders, including
      employing people from regional outlying centres for our packhouses.

      Seeka has recruited cadets into its business with nine cadets now in the company. Creating a sustainable workforce is a
      priority for Seeka.



      Mr Bryan Grafas
      Bryan Grafas, Seeka’s general manager orchards, retired after 28 years with the company. Bryan helped grow the company
      to become the largest kiwifruit orchardist in Australia and New Zealand, along the way he developed the long term leases,
      many of which are now transitioning back to the landowners having delivered signiﬁcant economic beneﬁt to Seeka and
      its investors.

      He was a truly inspirational leader; he lead Seeka’s orchard business through the Psa outbreak. Bryan remains closely
      associated with Seeka, he remains a grower and friend of the company. Seeka thanks Bryan for his service and leadership.

Mr Malcolm Cartwright
Malcolm Cartwright, Seeka's deputy chair, retires following 15-years of service to the board and company. Malcolm
brought a strong grower and governance focus to the board, having been the inaugural chair of Seeka Growers Limited
(SGL) up to 2014, and a director of AvoFresh Limited since 2008.

Prior to joining Seeka, Malcolm held positions at NZKMB, NZKGI and KNZ, and was instrumental in forming a competitive
post harvest kiwifruit industry and generating value from a coordinated, single-desk export structure. While a director, and
grower-supplier to Seeka, he helped shape our business as we formed close working relationships with growers founded
on performance.

Malcolm will continue to make a valuable contribution to our business as a council member of SGL, a director of AvoFresh,
and a loyal and much-valued supplier of kiwifruit and kiwiberry. The board and company thank Malcolm for his insights
and service.



Close
In 2016, Seeka delivered record operational earnings on the back of exceptional kiwifruit yields, record fruit volumes and
strong post harvest performance.

Seeka has conﬁdence in the long-term growth in the New Zealand kiwifruit industry, although lower Hayward volumes will
impact in 2017. Seeka's strategy will see it buffer the direct consequence of the lower volumes on ﬁnancial results through
its diversiﬁed business strategy.

While we forecast a drop in earnings, your company is well positioned to deliver rewarding stakeholder performance in
2017; we have a large and loyal grower base that has beneﬁtted from our strong operational and ﬁnancial performance,
and a more-diverse product offering to our key supply-chain partners.

We remain focused on growing the value of our business and growing shareholder earnings.

Directors and management thank our many stakeholders for the support they have given our business. We are committed
to providing you with a high-quality service and the opportunity to select excellence as a grower, contractor, supplier, or
investor, as we grow rewarding futures for this and future generations.

Basis of Preparation
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that apply to the full set of financial statements.
Accounting policies which are limited to a specific note, are described in that note.
Reporting entity and statutory base
The financial statements presented are those of the consolidated Seeka group comprising Seeka Limited (the Company) together with
its subsidiaries (the Group, Seeka or Seeka Group).

Seeka Limited is a profit-orientated company registered in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 and an FMC Reporting Entity
for the purposes of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Seeka Limited is listed and its ordinary shares are quoted on the NZX
main board equity security market (NZX Main Board).

On Friday 28 October 2016 Seeka Kiwifruit Industries Limited was renamed Seeka Limited.

Nature of operations
Seeka is a produce business operating in New Zealand and Australia.

In New Zealand the Group provides orcharding, post harvest and retail services to New Zealand’s kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry
industries. The Group also provides retail and ripening services for imported tropical produce, and operates a wholesale market.

In Australia, following a 2015 acquisition of land, orchards and business assets, the Group became the largest single producer and
supplier of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, a major supplier of European pears, plus lesser production of other temperate-climate
fruits.

Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 7 of the FMC
Act 2013. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), incorporating New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other applicable
financial reporting standards as appropriate for profit-oriented entities. The Group financial statements also comply with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of:

         financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the profit or loss (note 31 and 32)
         biological assets at fair value (note 11)
         land and buildings at the revaluation model (note 9)
         Irrigation water rights (note 14)

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.

The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) on 27 February 2017.

Seeka                  ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses
resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of
subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing during the month of that
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income
statement.

Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

          Assets and liabilities for each entity's balance sheet within the Group are translated at the closing rate at the date of that
           balance sheet;
          Income and expenses for each entity's income statement and statement of other comprehensive income, are translated at
           average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
           prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the
           transactions); and
          All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to the understanding of the financial statements are
provided throughout the accompanying notes. The accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the periods
presented in these financial statements. Certain comparative information has been reclassified to conform with the current year’s
presentation. There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued and effective, that are expected to
have a significant impact on the Group (note 33).

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning future operational and financial performance. By definition, these
assumptions may not always equal actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are identified in the notes below. Estimates and judgements are continually
evaluated and are based on historical experience as adjusted for current market conditions and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Assumptions underlying management’s estimates can be
found in the following notes to the financial statements.

Area of estimation                                                             Note

Property, plant and equipment                                                     9

Goodwill                                                                         10

Biological assets                                                                11

Going concern assumption
The Group reported a profit before tax of $13.61m (2015: $5.25m) and operating cash inflows of $21.25m (2015: $1.80m) for the year
ended 31 December 2016. As at 31 December 2016 the Group had net assets of $85.31m (2015: $70.82m).

The ability of the Group to remain in compliance with its bank covenants has been considered by the Board in the adoption of the
going concern assumption during the preparation of these financial statements. The Board forecasts that the Group can trade at levels
appropriate to meet its bank covenants for the 2017 financial year.

In doing so they have considered forecast information, the security of bank funding, and any potential impact on ongoing crop supply
including Psa-V.

Goods and services tax (GST)
The statement of financial performance and statement of comprehensive income has been prepared so that all components are stated
exclusive of GST. All items in the statement of financial position are stated net of GST, with the exception of receivables and
payables, which include GST invoiced.

Seeka                 ANNUAL REPORT 2016


Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the
individual operating segments.

Note 1. Segment Information
The Group’s operating segments are entities that engage in business activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in
a manner consistent with the internal reports provided to the chief decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the
allocation of resources alongside operational outcomes and are responsible for implementing strategic decisions.

The Group has five operating segments:

          Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries.
          A single Australian segment encompasses the integrated business associated with the Group’s Australian-grown produce.

Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs
and insurance proceeds recorded in the statement of financial performance are allocated to all other segments. Transactions between
segments are conducted at arm’s length and are eliminated on consolidation.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations

The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.

The Group also produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:

          Leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts) whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
           orchard owners.
          Leased land (long term contracts) which the Group has developed into productive orchards, pays all development and
           production costs, and owns all crops for the term of the lease.

Post harvest operations

The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the Group’s
orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from independent orchard owners.

Retail service operations

The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This
includes fruit from the Group’s orchard and post harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and ripening
services for imported fruit produce, and operates a wholesale market.

In the second half of the year the Group entered a direct buying arrangement for the importation and supply of bananas in New
Zealand whereby total revenues and expenses are reported in the statement of financial performance. Previously the Group had
imported bananas on an agency arrangement whereby the Group only reported commission revenue.

Since September 2016, following the Group’s purchase of the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges (see note 24), retail
service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies to hospitals and the retail sector.

All other segments - New Zealand

This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower services and overhead sections along with insurance proceeds
recorded in the statement of financial performance and impairment and revaluations of other assets not attributed directly to any other
segment.

Australian operations
The Group owns and operates Australian orchards, provides post harvest operations and markets the fruit produced from those
orchards, primarily in Australia. The main products are kiwifruit, nashi pears and European pears.

Turnover

Turnover (a non-GAAP measure) includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers where the Group acts as
the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. (See note 2).

EBITDA and EBIT

EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of
profitability and reflects operating cash flow generation.

EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods
and services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of
growers and suppliers where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all
produce sales both local and export.

In the second half of 2016 the Group entered a direct buying arrangement for the importation and supply of bananas in New Zealand
whereby total revenues and expenses are reported in the statement of financial performance. Previously the Group had imported
bananas on an agency arrangement whereby the Group only reported commission revenue.

Revenue is shown net of discounts, which include the $2.93m cost of the grower incentive scheme (2015: $2.49m) (see below for
details).

Impact of seasonality
Group revenues are generated from seasonal horticultural operations, with post harvest revenues recognised as services are
provided and orchard revenues recognised once the fruit is harvested. Retail revenues are generated at the point of sale. In New
Zealand kiwifruit are harvested from March to June, avocados from August to January, and kiwiberries from February to March. In
Australia nashi and European pears are harvested January to March, and kiwifruit from March to May.

Oakside fire - insurance proceeds for asset loss
On 4 March 2015 a fire at the Group's Oakside facility destroyed an ancillary packhouse and caused damage to an office space and a
number of coolstore buildings and associated plant, all part of post harvest operations. The Group is fully insured for loss on assets
and also business interruption, and in 2015 the loss on the asset claim was accepted by the Group insurers NZI, QBE and AIG.
During the 2015 financial year the value of insurance recoveries for the loss of property and business interruption was $5.46m, of
which the Group received $2.48m, recognised as other income in the statement of financial performance. During the current year the
value of the claim was finalised, and a further $0.5m was recorded in the statement of financial performance and the balance of
insurance proceeds received.

As a result of the March 2015 fire at the groups Oakside facility, Seeka and its growers suffered a financial loss due to extraordinary
fruit softening and fruit loss. This loss was subject to an insurance claim and Seeka advanced the grower pool $4.04m to minimise the
risk of grower loss with the advance only to be repaid as a priority charge from any further insurance proceeds received should the
active claim be accepted and paid.

During the current financial year the growers insurance claim was accepted and a full and final settlement agreed with the insurer,
with Seeka receiving $3.63m which is recorded in the statement of financial performance (see note 4).

Grower incentive scheme
In response to industry-wide crop loss from the kiwifruit vine disease Psa-V, in 2013 the Group initiated a grower incentive scheme to
secure post harvest volumes for harvests 2014, 2015 and 2016. Eligible growers that joined the scheme committed to supply all
kiwifruit and kiwiberry crops from their orchards up to and including harvest 2016. In return, when each season's supply obligation is
met (in September) the Company issues each complying grower with $0.10 worth of shares for every tray supplied that season.
Shares are issued at the NZX volume weighted average price (VWAP) of shares prior to the issue.

For accounting purposes, the Group recognises:

         the expense as a discount to sales from post harvest revenue in the statement of financial performance, and
         the value of issued shares as share capital when the shares are issued.

The year ended 31 December 2016 is the final year of the three year scheme.

Accounting policies

Revenue comprises the fair value received for the sale of goods and services, net of goods and services tax (GST), rebates and
discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.

Orchard revenue
Managed orchards - revenue is invoiced and recognised as earned for orcharding services provided to managed orchards supplying
the Group.

Leased orchards and leased land orchards - crop revenue is recognised in the statement of financial performance at the point of
harvest based on forecast orchard gate returns (OGRs) with a corresponding increase in the statement of financial position. The
proceeds are then received over the 12 month period following harvest. Revenue estimates are updated at balance date.

Post harvest revenue
From fruit packing, coolstorage and other supply-chain activities. Services peak from April to December with the bulk of revenues
collected by end November. Revenue is recognised as services are provided.

Retail service revenue
Ripening and delivery services, and fruit sales to key retail customers - revenue is recognised as services are provided on a principal
or agency basis depending on who bears the risks and rewards.

Fruit marketing and wholesale market sales programmes (domestic and international) – where the Group acts as an agent and
collects a commission on sales with revenue recognised when the produce is sold.

Where the Group purchases fruit directly from suppliers for resale, revenue is recognised when the produce is sold.

Collaborative marketing programmes (the Group purchases fruit from Zespri International for sale in agreed international markets
under licence from Kiwifruit New Zealand) - revenue is recognised when the produce is sold.

Where the Group manufactures and sells products, revenue is recognised when the products are sold.

Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.

Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

Grower relationship payment - fruit loss
On 4 March 2015 a fire at the Group's Oakside packhouse destroyed part of the facility and caused damage to an ancillary
packhouse, office space and a number of coolstore buildings and associated plant, all part of post harvest operations. Seeka and its
growers suffered extraordinary fruit softening and loss as the result of the fire and the strategy put in place to mitigate fruit loss at that
site. While the strategy was successful, growers still suffered extraordinary financial loss that is the subject of a further insurance
claim by Seeka Growers Limited for the value of the fruit lost. As at 31 December 2015 the claim was partly agreed, but a substantial
portion was still in the process of evaluation by their Insurance underwriters. Seeka considered it important to stand by its growers
while they worked through the detailed insurance process and during the 2015 financial year advanced $4.04m to the grower pool so
as to maintain its grower payments thereby minimising the risk of grower loss. In doing so, it was agreed that the advance will only be
repaid to Seeka as a priority charge from any further insurance proceeds from the active insurance claim should the claim be
accepted. On 11 November 2016, full and final settlement with the grower’s insurer was agreed and Seeka was repaid $3.63m which
is recorded in the statement of financial performance as a repayment of the advance made in 2015 by Seeka.

Seeka                  ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Accounting policies

Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of financial performance as incurred, except where a future economic benefit
arises and they are recorded as prepayment.

Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group are classified as operating
leases.

Operating leases include short term orchard leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the
lessor) are charged to the statement of financial performance on a straight line basis over the period of the lease, except for short
term orchard leases where lease costs are recognised at the same time as other crop related income and expenses.

Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the
reporting date are recognised in other payables in respect of employees' services up to the reporting date and are measured at the
amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave
is taken and measured at the rates paid or payable.

In the current year an adjustment has been made between deferred tax and the current tax liability to amend the opening balance.

Accounting policies

Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date, and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the tax losses of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination and that affects neither accounting or taxable
profit. Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities are not recognised to the extent that they
probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on
the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at balance date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.

Note 7. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

The following table details the offset amounts.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the
future taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2015
- Nil).

The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the
buildings; actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.




Note 8. Events occurring after balance date
There are no material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction and
in the 2015 financial year those damaged by the Oakside fire), plus any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation
for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers, ANZIV, independent registered valuer. In Australia
valuations are undertaken by Goulburn Valley Property Services, independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. At each
balance date approximately one third of assets classified as land and buildings are revalued and these valuations are used to assess
the appropriateness of the carrying values of all assets classified as land and buildings that are held by the group.

Valuations are undertaken by the independent valuers using inherently subjective techniques that include estimations.

The valuers consider four different approaches in concert to arrive at a fair value;

      1.    Replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements based on
            the current cost of construction less depreciation based on the age of the building with an allowance for physical
            depreciation. Specific consideration is given to the 'optimised depreciated replacement cost' methodology.
      2.    Sales - considers sales of other comparable properties.
      3.    Investment - assumes a hypothetical lease of the property with a current market rental being established and capitalising
            this at an appropriate rate of return (10% – 12.5%) that would be expected by a prudent investor.
      4.    Discounted cash flow –First used in 2016: This is a variation of the investment method whereby it takes the current market
            rental calculated under the investment method and forecasts net cash flows over a period of 10 years. The cash flows are
            adjusted for expected growth in market rentals and estimated costs incurred to maintain the land and buildings in
            operational use. This method assumes the land and buildings are sold in the terminal year (year 11).

The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax of $1,943k
(2015: $3,130k).

                                                                                                   Land         Buildings                Total

As a consequence of the building revaluations conducted December 2016, $1.63m (Dec 2015 - $0.23m) of accumulated depreciation
was offset directly against the assets' cost or valuation, prior to revaluation.

Details of what the depreciated value of land and buildings would be if they were stated on a historical cost basis are as follows.

Impairment
On 4 March 2015, the Group's Oakside facility suffered a fire which led to the destruction or damage to an ancillary packhouse and
office, and a number of coolstore buildings and associated plant, all of which were part of post harvest operations.

As a result the Group recognised a $1.74m asset impairment expense within the statement of financial performance during the year
ended 31 December 2015.

The Group was fully insured for loss on assets and also business interruption with the claim settled in the current financial year. The
group received insurance recoveries of $5.96m of which $0.50m has been recorded in the statement of financial performance in the
current year (2015: $5.46m).

During the year the group replaced some of its Australian bearer plants as part of a plant and crop renewal plan. This resulted in an
impairment and the write off of the carrying value of bearer plants replaced by $0.1m which has been recognised through the
statement of financial performance.

Accounting policies

Bearer plants

Bearer plants are the Group's investment in kiwifruit vines, pear, avocado and other fruiting trees on Group-owned and leased land.
Bearer plants are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to purchase the asset.

Land and Buildings

Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at least triennial valuations by independent valuers, plus any
subsequent improvements at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. At each annual balance date, approximately one third
of assets classified as land and buildings are revalued and those valuations are used to assess the appropriateness of the carrying
values of all land and building assets held by the Group. Revaluations are performed more frequently if changing industry conditions
may cause their carrying value to differ significantly from fair value. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is
eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

Changes in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and buildings are accounted through comprehensive income and other
reserves, except where an assets fair value is less the original cost, in which case the change is recognised in the statement of
financial performance.

Plant and Equipment and Motor Vehicles

All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes all costs incurred to
purchase the asset.

Subsequent additions at cost are included in the asset’s carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it
is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of financial performance during the financial period in which
they are incurred.

Impairment of assets are recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line or diminishing value method to allocate their
cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation of bearer plants on leased
land orchards is aligned to the term of the lease.

The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

         Buildings: 20 - 50 years
         Machinery: 10 - 20 years
         Vehicles: 4 - 7 years
         Furniture, fittings and equipment: 3 - 10 years
         Bearer plants: 5 - 50 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at balance date.

An asset’s carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount, and any gain or loss is included in
the statement of financial performance. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in the revaluation reserve in respect of
those assets is transferred to retained earnings.

The amortisation period of software is four to five years and the remaining amortisation period for the interest in leased land is from 34
to 92 years.

The Group's interest in leased land occupied, or held for future development, arose on the acquisition of Huka Pak and is the
difference in the value of the lease terms to relative market terms.

Permanent water shares are an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure required to grow pears, kiwifruit and other annual
crops in Australia and are carried at cost. The fair value of permanent water shares used for impairment testing is supported by the
traded price of the shares.

Impairment tests for goodwill
The Board reviews business performance based on operating segments and monitors goodwill at the operating segment level in
accordance with the policy below. Goodwill represents the Group's retail services acquired with Glassfields, the acquisition of Seeka
Australia (Pty) Limited and the acquisition of the Kiwi Crush and Kiwi Crushies product ranges.

The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the 5 year after-tax cash flow projection, with a terminal value beyond 5
years. Cash flows beyond the 5 year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates stated below. The
assumptions used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margin for the cash generating unit, is determined based
on past performance and Directors' expectations of future market development. No impairment arose in the current year.

No impairment would be required if the discount rate applied was 1% higher or if the terminal growth rate was 1% lower.

Accounting policies

Intangible assets
Assets with a finite useful life are subject to depreciation and amortisation and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not
subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually for impairment, with impairment losses recognised when the carrying amount
exceeds the recoverable amount. When assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest identifiable unit able to generate
cash flow.

Software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific
software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful life (typically three to five years).

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the
acquired business or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of a business is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included in investments in associates. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is not
amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if deemed prudent, goodwill is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to that
entity.

Supplier contracts
When an intangible asset is recognised on a supplier contract it is amortised over the life of the contract on a straight line basis. The
expense is charged to the statement of financial performance.

Lease interest in land

The Group’s interest in long term leased land occupied, or held for future development, is amortised over the life of the lease and
tested for impairment on a triennial basis along with land and buildings.

Permanent water shares
The Group records permanent water shares at cost; the shares have an indefinite life and are not depreciated. Integral to growing
annual crops in Australia, the carrying value is tested annually for impairment and as required, adjusted to take account of any
impairment losses.

Other intangibles
Other intangibles include a licence to grow G3 kiwifruit and is amortised over the life of the licence on a straight line basis. The
expense is charged to the statement of financial performance.

Note 11. Biological assets - crop
Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.

Crop assets are kiwifruit, Nashi pears, Packham Pears, Corella Pears, other pears, cherries, avocado, apricot, and plum crops
growing on leased and owned orchards and yet to be harvested at balance date.

Crop where cost is deemed fair value:

Kiwifruit, Nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance
date and as such cost is deemed fair value.

For each crop cost is tested for impairment at balance date using the Group budget for yields and market returns less costs yet to be
incurred on an orchard by orchard basis to establish a recoverable value for the crop on each of the groups orchards.

Where the recoverable value is less than cost, the cost is impaired through the statement of financial performance (note 30).

Accounting policies

Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair
value depends on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.

When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (so long
as the costs are considered recoverable).

When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to
market.

The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference to current and expected sales returns when available, in the
event market data is not available an assessment is made based on historical data.

Within current trade receivables, $1.14m are past due (Dec 2015 - $1.35m), of which 5% are more than 90 days (Dec 2015 - 4%).
Non-current trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with
repayment terms of up to five years.

Accounting policies

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.

Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due but not considered impaired. Debts which
are known to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is objective evidence that
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Accounting policies

Raw materials and stores, work in progress, finished goods and fruit produce are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and direct labour, and are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average
costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sales costs.

Accounting policies

Allocation rights are carried at fair value supported by the value of the traded rights on a recognised exchange or market at
measurement date.

Annual water allocation rights are recognised as a current asset when they are allocated to the group’s permanent water shares from
the first of July each year by the Victorian Water Register, and are subsequently expensed when the water entitlement is used to
irrigate the orchards.

                                                                                                                    2016             2015

Accounting policies

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value (the invoiced amount). If the Group has been provided with extended terms of
trade, they are then recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The provision for onerous leases relates to a coolstore lease that is no longer required. The lease on the coolstore expires 31 March
2017, and the provision is discounted at 10% per annum.

No other leases were identified as onerous.

Accounting policies

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated
reliably and the Group expects to settle the obligation.

The Group’s total facilities of $114.8m (Dec 2015 - $115.6m) comprise a multi-option credit facility of $31.2m (Dec 2015 - $31.4m) and
term loans of $83.6m (Dec 2015 - $84.2m).

All of the Group’s term loans are on interest-only repayment terms.

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to
protect the term portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates. See note 31.

Accounting policies

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised
cost.

When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan
transaction cost. When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services
and amortised over the period of the facility.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after balance date.

                                                                                                                        2016              2015

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the
number of fully paid shares held.

Grower Incentive Scheme
On 7 September 2016, the Group issued 666,124 shares at a price of $4.40 each in respect of the 2016 kiwifruit supply season to
participating growers. See note 3.

Accounting policies

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until
the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity
holders.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (excluding any costs of
servicing equity other than ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period,
adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the period.

Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after
income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average
number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of
the period.

Share based payment reserve
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based compensation plans: a new employees share scheme that was established in
2014, and a scheme established in 2002 that is not active and is in the process of being terminated with all surplus shares sold during
the year.

The active scheme is managed by a trust established in October 2014, and the directors of the trustee company (Seeka Employee
Share Plan Trustee Limited) are also Directors of Seeka.

Under the employee share schemes shares are issued to an employee share trust, with certain employees eligible to subscribe to
shares held by the trust with this benefit recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting
period. At the end of the vesting period the employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares
transferred to them, alternatively the employee can elect not to have the shares transferred to them and any outstanding debt will be
forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees.

At balance date, the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted to employees and remain outstanding under the
schemes was 416,500 (Dec 2015 - 423,300), representing 2.59% (Dec 2015 - 2.59%) of the shares of the Company on issue at that
date. There are no shares outstanding under the 2002 scheme (Dec 2015: 242,000).

The shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust.

The shares held by the ESS carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares. While monies are owed on the shares they
remain with the trustee.

The options element of the scheme is valued using a Black Scholes pricing model. Because the Company has a small market
capitalisation with minimal trading, the Board forecasts expected volatility.

Accounting policies

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense in the statement of
financial performance with a corresponding increase in the share based payment reserve. The fair value is determined by reference to
the fair value of the options granted, calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).

When the shares vest, the amount of the reserve relating to those shares is transferred to share capital.

Shares may be issued at the Board’s discretion at a price set by the Board based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
calculation of the Company's shares during the period prior to issue. The Employee Share Scheme (ESS) cannot be issued with
further shares if that issue would result in the ESS having an interest of more than 5% of the Company’s issued capital. Shares are
issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust. Dividends paid on the shares are applied towards repaying the debt
between the ESS and the Group on behalf of the employee.

Proceeds received along with any employee contributions are credited to share capital when the options are exercised.

ESS has a non-beneficial interest in all the shares allocated to employees. Annually the Group reviews the scheme and decides upon
the allocation of further shares and the price at which those shares will be issued to the ESS. Trustees of ESS are appointed for an
unspecified term and may be removed by the Company at any time.

Shares held by the ESS carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares.

The dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the
dividend re-investment plan. Cash dividend payment was $3.12m (Dec 2015: $2.52m).

On 27 February 2017, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend will be paid 24 March to those
shareholders on the register at 5pm on 17 March, 2017. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply to the dividend. This dividend
declaration brings fully imputed dividends distributed to shareholders relating to the 2016 financial year to $0.20 per share, compared
to $0.19 per share relating to the 2015 financial year.

Accounting policies

Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the period but not distributed at balance date.

Impairment of investment
The group owns 32% of UPNZ Limited (UPNZ). During the current financial year Seeka fully impaired its $340,000 investment in the
Company. UPNZ imports plastic pocket packs from China and Chile and distributes them to the New Zealand kiwifruit industry. In late
March 2016, a visual inspection found grease deposits on several packs supplied by UPNZ. As a consequence Zespri Group Limited
(Zespri) placed all kiwifruit packed into UPNZ pocket packs sourced from China on hold until they could determine whether the grease
posed any potential food safety issues. UPNZ was forced to recall this product and as a result its customers, including Seeka,
suffered costs checking the packed kiwifruit inventory to remove all affected trays. Seeka believes this will have a major impact on the
value of its investment in UPNZ and has recognised an impairment in the statement of financial performance.

Seeka                     ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Provision
Prior to discovering the grease contamination, the Group supplied Zespri with 212,153 trays of kiwifruit packed into UPNZ pocket
packs that were potentially affected. The Group is advised that offshore checking by Zespri of the 212,153 trays found 12 trays
contaminated with grease. As a consequence Zespri has made a claim against the Group for all the costs of checking that product
including all fruit loss, irrespective of cause. The Group is in dispute with Zespri over the claim, but the Directors have made a
provision in these accounts for the most likely value that they believe the Group could be found liable for. That provision is not
disclosed as it is considered commercially sensitive while the dispute is in progress.

Accounting policies

The fair values of the listed securities are based on the securities' closing share price at balance date. Where pricing information is
available, unlisted securities are revalued at balance date. All other unlisted securities are currently held at cost less impairment as it
reasonably represents current fair value. The carrying amount of all unlisted securities have been reviewed at balance date and any
impairment is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income to the extent of any related reserve available and then
through the statement of financial performance.

Accounting policies

Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the
voting rights in the entity.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost.

The Group's share of associates' profits or losses are recognised in the statement of financial performance and the carrying amount of
the investment in the statement of financial position.

Dividends received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

Note 29. Risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks specific to producing and selling horticultural crops, along with corporate financial
risks related to credit, liquidity and capital risk. The Group operates a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation programme via
its audit and risk committee.

The Group's policy is to ensure that the Group creates value and maximises returns to its shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders, as well as ensuring that adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Group’s business whilst
managing its financial risks.

a. Risk management strategies related to orchard and retail operations
Horticultural operations expose the Group to risks to production and market returns. The main production risks are climatic events,
diseases and pests. These impact on volumes produced from the Group's orchards, volumes to post harvest (both from Group
operations and independent growers) and volumes available for retail.

Market risks of pricing and exchange rates impact on orchard operations (the amount the Group is paid for growing crops) and impact
on retail revenues where the Group imports and sells fruit produce, mainly bananas. The exchange rate risk on imports is managed
through the use of foreign exchange contracts to match known and planned purchases. Market risks do not directly impact on post
harvest operations, as charges are normally set prior to harvest and deducted before sales revenues are paid to supplying growers.

The Group operates in four regions spread over two countries; New Zealand's Northland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty, and in
Australia's Mundoona region of Victoria. Main produce lines are kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears and avocados, with small
production of other temperate-climate fruits. Group retail activities are in New Zealand (including imported tropical produce), Australia
and Asia. The Group's geographical, product and market spread limits the impact on Group operations from an adverse event
occurring in a specific region, produce or market. To further mitigate risks, the Board uses the following strategies.

Production risks - climatic events, disease and pests

The Group follows industry best practice to mitigate production risks. This includes orchard management practices to optimise
production from Group orchards, and extensive planning to ensure post harvest and retail services are suitably resourced to manage
each season's crop volumes.

In New Zealand, the major climatic risks are hail, frost and storm damage.

          hail events are typically highly localised, and for kiwifruit the Group has access to industry hail insurance for its orchard
           operations, plus top-up payments from a Seeka Growers Limited hail insurance programme.
          frost events are typically regional, and the Group advocates best-practice crop protection, including active frost
           management on kiwifruit orchards operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's post harvest operations.
          storm events are typically regional, and the Group advocates best-practice crop protection, including shelter belts on all
           orchards operated by the Group and other growers supplying the Group's post harvest operations.

In Australia, the major climatic risks are drought, hail and fire. As the owner and operator of all orchards supplying its Australian
operations, the Group actively manages climatic risks of its total production base. The orchards are located on three sites in the
Mundoona region.

          Drought: to secure adequate irrigation, the Group has purchased extensive, long-term water shares from a reliable
           irrigation programme.
          Hail events are typically localised, and the Group currently has hail cloth protecting one orchard.
          Fire: risk of serious grass wild-fire rises during periods of extreme weather, with the Country Fire Authority responsible for
           risk assessment and management of fire events. The Group takes all practical steps to internally manage fire risk including
           removing excess vegetation from Group properties.

Seeka                 ANNUAL REPORT 2016

All horticultural undertakings are susceptible to disease and pest incursions. To minimise the risk of crop loss the Group monitors its
orchards and undertakes recognised spray programmes to protect crops to the fullest extent possible. The kiwifruit vine disease
Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is widespread throughout New Zealand, and is being actively managed. To date Psa has
not been detected in Australia.

Market returns
New Zealand kiwifruit
The Group has no direct market risk from the sale of kiwifruit harvested from lease operations, as all export marketing activities are
undertaken by Zespri Group Limited (Zespri) under statutory regulations. The Group, however, is impacted by the level of Zespri's
market returns which impact on the Group's orchard profitability. The Group monitors Zespri returns and uses modelling techniques to
analyse current and projected orchard income. This information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.

New Zealand avocados and kiwiberries
The Group has a direct market risk from the sale of avocados and kiwiberries with half of the kiwiberry sales and all of the avocado
sales managed by the Group's retail operations. The Group forecasts seasonal supply, monitors market conditions, develops a sales
programme around the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to optimise market access and returns. This
information is used when setting Group budgets and orchard lease terms.

The Group has a direct currency risk from export sales as it does not own the products but acts as the growers’ agent. The Group
may hedge up to the total cash flows from each operation using actual sales made and estimated total product volumes to be
exported.

Imported tropical produce
The Group has a direct market, price and currency risk from imported fruit produce (banana, pineapple and papaya) where the Group
imports fruit produce for sale as the principle through its supply and sale contracts. The Group may hedge up to the total known and
projected cash flows to manage the exchange risk. The Group has no material direct price and currency risk from imported fruit
produce where the supply agreement enables the Group to amend its purchase price according to trading conditions.

Australian produce
The Group has a direct market and price risk from the sale of all Australian product which is managed by the Group's Australian
operations. As the largest single grower and supplier of Australian kiwifruit and nashi pears, the Group has developed strong
relationships with key retailers. The Group forecasts seasonal supply, monitors market conditions, develops a sales programme
around the needs of key retailers and controls product quality and supply to optimise market access and returns.

Seeka Australia is the Group’s single major international operation, exposing the Group to the Australian dollar. Foreign exchange risk
includes future commercial transactions, assets, liabilities and net investments. Currency exposure from net assets is managed
through borrowings in Australian dollars.

Accounting policies

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Operating leases include short term orchard leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the statement of
financial performance on a straight line basis over the period of the lease, except for short term orchard leases where lease costs are
recognised at the same time as other crop related income and expenses.

b. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
customers, including outstanding receivables, derivative financial instruments and committed transactions.

The maximum credit risk is the financial loss to the Group if counterparties fail to discharge a contractual obligation. The Group's
maximum exposure is:

         the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the consolidated statement of financial
          position, and
         the amount of contingent liabilities, if any, in relation to the financial guarantees provided by the Group.

For banks and financial institutions, only registered banks or their subsidiaries are accepted. The Group does not generally require
any collateral or security to support financial instruments due to the quality of the financial institutions.

For customers, including outstanding receivables, the Group deals predominantly with growers for which it receives payment for post
harvest services directly from Seeka Growers Limited. Credit risk is therefore not considered significant.

Other than concentration of credit risk on liquid funds deposited with one bank with a high credit rating, the Group does not have any
other significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables are spread over approximately 200 customers.

The following table details cash balances at balance date.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.

The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to
ensure that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet
its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.

When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.

At balance date, the Group had $114.8m (2015 - $115.6m) of available credit of which $74.4m (2015 - $54.2m) was drawn. All credit
lines are currently provided by one finance provider.

The following table details the remaining contractual maturities at balance date of the Group’s financial liabilities.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital
structure to support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.

The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or
selling assets.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.

The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

                                                                                                                             2016            2015

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings
times interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants. Refer to note 17.

Seeka                    ANNUAL REPORT 2016

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified on the statement of financial
position either as available-for-sale or at fair value through profit or loss. The majority of these investments are in industry-related
entities, only some of which are publicly traded.

A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and
equity reserves.

The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management
procedures are deemed necessary.

The decision to change the fair value of an investment is recorded through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial
performance whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance was available. When no such reserve existed, any related loss is
processed directly in the statement of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions.
The Board continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are
designated as effective hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.

The following table details interest rate and price sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their impact on the
statement of financial performance or equity. Cash and advance balances do not attract interest and are not subject to pricing risk,
and have therefore been excluded from this analysis.

                                                                            Interest Rate Risk                                        Price Risk

Note 30. Determination of fair values
Fair value of financial assets
The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.

The different levels are defined as:

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement
date. Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited and irrigation water rights.

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant
would use when determining an appropriate price.

                                                                                     Level 1              Level 2       Level 3               Total

Accounting policies

Financial assets, liabilities and instruments
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
purposes. Fair value measurements are categorised into a three-level hierarchy, based on the types of inputs to the valuation
techniques used.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and available-for-sale
securities) is based on quoted market prices at balance date (level 1 inputs). The quoted market price used for financial assets held
by the Group is the current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined
using valuation techniques (level 2 inputs). The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market
conditions existing at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt
instruments held. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.

Trade receivable and payables
The carrying value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values
due to their short term nature. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with unobservable (level 3 inputs) reflect the
assumptions that market participants would use when determining an appropriate price, additional disclosure is provided for the inputs
and assumptions used in such cases.

Land and buildings and interest in leased land
Fair value is determined on a rolling 3-year cycle by an independent valuer, with approximately one third of land and buildings assets
are value each year using four different approaches as described in note 9.

Group bank loans currently bear an average variable interest rate of 3.5% (Dec 2015 - 5.4%), with the Group using interest rate
swaps to protect the term portion of the loans. Swaps cover 64% (Dec 2015 - 93%) of the term liabilities at balance date and are
classified as held for trading or as cash flow hedges.

Accounting policies

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to
their fair value at each balance date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised as a financing cost in profit or loss immediately unless
the derivative is designated and effective as a hedge instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends
on the nature of the hedge relationship. Derivatives are classified as current or non-current based on the effective date.

Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents
whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the
hedged item.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedge relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold,
terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or no longer meets the
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of financial performance. When a forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is
immediately transferred to the statement of financial performance within other gains / (losses).

Derivatives and financial instruments
The Board uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active
market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions
are based on quoted market rates and reliance placed on quotes provided by Westpac.

Accounting policies

The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and
receivables and available for sale financial assets. Classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
The Group determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance date.

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised when the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments
are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in
the statement of financial performance. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments
have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available for
sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

This category has two sub categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss on
initial recognition. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so
designated by the Group. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading.

Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of selling the receivable. Loans
and receivables are included in receivables in the statement of financial position.

Available for sale financial assets

Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either designated
in this category or not classified in any of the other category. They are included in non-current assets unless the Group intends to
dispose of the investment within 12 months of balance date.

Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date or the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the
asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through
profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have
been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Realised
and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
category are included in the statement of financial performance in the period in which they arise. Unrealised gains and losses arising
from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available for sale are recognised in other comprehensive
income in the available for sale investments revaluation reserve. However, if the loss is deemed to represent objective evidence of an
impairment, any additional loss over and above previous gains recognised in reserves will be recognised in the statement of financial
performance. When securities classified as available for sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the
statement of financial performance as gains and losses from investment securities.

The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset or unlisted security is not
active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include reference to the fair values of recent arm’s
length transactions, involving the same instruments or other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow
analysis, and option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances.

Impairment of financial assets

At balance date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a security below its
cost is considered in determining whether the security is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets,
the cumulative loss is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on
that financial asset previously recognised in profit and loss, is removed from equity and recognised in the statement of financial
performance. Impairment losses on equity instruments recognised in the statement of financial performance are not reversed through
other comprehensive income.

Seeka                  ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Note 33. Application of new and revised New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are now in effect
The following new standard and amendments are mandatory for the first time in the current year and adopted by the Group.

NZ IAS 41 (Amendment) 'Agriculture'. (effective for annual periods beginning or after 1 January 2016). Early adoption was allowed.
Biological assets except for bearer plants are accounted for under IAS 41 while bearer plants are accounted for under IAS 16
'Property, Plant and Equipment'. The amendments also clarify that produce growing on bearer plants is to be accounted for under IAS
41. This amendment was adopted early by the Group and applied retrospectively from 1 January 2013.

NZ IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016). The amendment requires an
investor to apply the principles of business combination accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a
business in NZ IFRS 3. Existing interests in the joint operation are not remeasured on acquisition of an additional interest, provided
joint control is maintained.

Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective
The Group has not early applied the following new and revised standards, amendments or interpretations that have been issued but
are not yet effective:

NZ IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017). NZ IFRS 15
addresses recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. It replaces the current revenue recognition guidance in NZ IAS 18
Revenue and NZ IAS 11 Construction contracts and is applicable to all entities with revenue. It sets out a 5 step model for revenue
recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has yet to assess NZ IFRS 15's full impact. The
Group will apply this standard from 1 January 2017.

NZ IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). NZ IFRS 9 is to replace IAS 39
and will simplify the mixed measurement model as well as establish three primary measurement categories for financial assets:
amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through profit and loss. Basis of classification depends on the entity's business
model and contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. IAS 39 guidance on impairment and hedge accounting will continue to
apply.

NZ IFRS 16 'Leases' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). NZ IFRS 16 replaces the current guidance in
NZ IAS 17. Under NZ IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Under NZ IAS 17, a lessee was required to make a distinction between a
finance lease (on balance sheet) and an operating lease (off balance sheet). NZ IFRS 16 now requires a lessee to recognise a lease
liability reflecting future lease payments and a ‘right-of-use asset’ for virtually all lease contracts. Included is an optional exemption for
certain short-term leases and leases of low-value assets; however, this exemption can only be applied by lessees.

For lessors, the accounting for leases under NZ IFRS 16 is almost the same as NZ IAS 17. However, because the guidance on the
definition of a lease has been updated (as well as the guidance on the combination and separation of contracts), lessors will also be
affected by the new standard.

The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted but only in
conjunction with NZ IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The Group intends to adopt NZ IFRS 16 on its effective date and has yet to assess its full impact.

Independent auditor’s report

To the shareholders of Seeka Limited

The consolidated financial statements comprise:

        the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016;
        the statement of financial performance for the year then ended;
        the statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
        the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
        the statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
        the notes to the financial statements, which include significant accounting policies.

Our opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company), including its
subsidiaries (the Group), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at 31
December 2016, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs NZ)
and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of
our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (Revised) Code of
Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (PES 1) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.

Our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of tax compliance and consultancy services.
The provision of these other services has not impaired our independence as auditor of the Group.

Our audit approach
Overview
                            An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance
                            whether the financial statements are free from material
                            misstatement.
                            Overall group materiality: $1.88 million, which represents
                            1% of Group revenue.
                            We selected 1% of revenue as the benchmark for our
                            materiality as we consider this is an appropriate measure
                            of performance of the Group. The Group operates in a
                            high volume low margin industry where net profit is not
                            representative of the scale of the Group.
                            KAM 1 –Valuation of Biological Assets – crop
                            KAM 2 – Valuation of Land and Buildings




Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out
above. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit, the
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both
individually and in aggregate on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Audit scope
We designed our audit by assessing the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial
statements and our application of materiality. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of
management override of internal controls including among other matters, consideration of whether there
was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.

We audited both the New Zealand and Australian operations of the Group at a materiality level calculated
by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned
or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes where the statutory materiality was
lower than that allocated in the Group calculation.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the
context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The Directors are responsible for the annual report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements
does not cover the other information included in the annual report and we do not and will not express any
form of assurance conclusion on the other information.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained
prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements, as a
whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs NZ and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the
External Reporting Board’s website at:

https://xrb.govt.nz/Site/Auditing_Assurance_Standards/Current_Standards/Page1.aspx

This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Who we report to
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body. Our audit work has been undertaken
so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s shareholders, as a body, for our audit work, for this report or
for the opinions we have formed.



The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Pip Cameron.

Summary of waivers granted by NZX
On 1 September 2014, NZX granted Seeka a waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 7.11.1 in relation to its grower incentive
scheme in respect of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 kiwifruit supply seasons.

Listing Rule 7.11.1 requires an issuer to issue shares within 5 business days after the latest date on which applications for those
shares close. Under Seeka's grower incentive scheme, a grower is required to return an entitlement and acceptance form prior to 31
March in the relevant supply season in order to participate in the scheme. However, a participating grower would not be issued shares
under the scheme until 7 September of the relevant supply and any future supply season(s), which is later than the 5 business day
period required by Listing Rule 7.11.1.

Accordingly, NZX has granted Seeka a waiver from the requirements of Listing Rule 7.11.1 for the purposes of its grower incentive
scheme. A condition of the waiver is that Seeka must issue shares within 5 business days of 31 August in each of the relevant supply
seasons.
