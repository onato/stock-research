    FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
    Seeka is pleased to provide you with this report covering the 2017 financial year.

    A seasonal reduction in New Zealand yields reduced kiwifruit harvested and processed by Seeka for the 2017 season by 21%
    compared to 2016. Within this total, the Hayward (green) component reduced by 33%. The scale of this reduction and its potential to
    significantly impact the company’s operational earnings was identified early. Seeka updated shareholders and took steps to minimise
    costs and maximise earnings.

    The steps taken by Seeka and outlined in this commentary led to a better profit from operations than forecast given the scale of the
    reduction in New Zealand kiwifruit volume.

    Seeka’s investment in new and upgraded plant, precooling and cool storage capacity in anticipation of higher crop volumes,
    particularly Zespri SunGold fruit, meant the company was able to optimise plant configuration and staff utilisation. Growers benefited
    through record low fruit loss while operational efficiencies reduced costs.

    A significant change to the banana sourcing arrangements of a key retail customer led to Seeka’s retail services business losing a
    supply contract. Annually the carrying values of all assets are reviewed for impairment, the loss of this supply contract resulted in an
    impairment of $2.031m in the carrying value of goodwill.

    Seeka ended the year with an excellent operational result and enters 2018 with a strong financial and operational outlook.


    Highlights
       • Profit after tax of $5.833m (2016: $10.385m), a decrease of 44%
         (2016 comparative included the one-off after tax gain from insurance proceeds of $3.092m)

       • Improved earnings from Seeka Australia with earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA) of NZD$2.251m (2016:
         $1.029m), up 119%.

       • Record low fruit loss to Seeka’s New Zealand kiwifruit growers of 1.18% for Hayward (green) conventional, 0.42% for Hayward
         (green) organic growers and 0.73% for Zespri SunGold growers. Comparatively good results within the industry and specifically
         the best Seeka has ever delivered.

       • Successful completion of the New Zealand 2016/17 avocado selling season with Seeka handling a record 487,095 export trays
         (2015/16: 225,656 export trays) delivering $24.85 per tray to growers (2016: $26.86). The forecast 2017/18 returns are in
         excess of $40.00 per export tray.

       • Successful and safe harvest seasons for all crops across Australia and New Zealand including kiwifruit, avocados, nashi, plums,
         pears and cherries.

       • Installation of a new $6.0m Compac Spectrim packing machine at Main Road Katikati that offers automated grading. Also the
         relocation of the existing machine to the Peninsula packhouse to handle increases in the Coromandel-grown crop.

       • Completion of the coolstore and pre-cooling capacity upgrades at Main Road, Katikati and at KKP and Transcool, Te Puke, an
         investment in excess of $8.6m.

       • Implementation of Seeka’s Australian orchard plan resulting in the development of 60 hectares of new kiwifruit orchard over the
         next five years along with the introduction of exciting new pear varieties.

       • Establishment and commissioning of the Delicious Nutritious Food Company delivering a first year earnings before interest, tax
         and depreciation of $0.294m.

       • Net debt (bank loans less bank deposits) totalled $83.121m (2016: $72.757m); an increase of $10.364m. Total assets increased
         from $197.309m to $222.023m; an increase of $24.714m.

  Dividend announcement
  A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 23 March 2018 to
  those shareholders on the register at 5pm, 16 March 2018. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply to the distribution. This dividend
  will bring the total dividends distributed in the last 12 months to $0.22 (prior twelve months $0.20).


  Outlook
  Seeka is anticipating a return to average Hayward (green) kiwifruit yields along with a steady increase in the Zespri SunGold volumes. The
  improvement programmes underway in Australia are expected to progressively improve earnings, and along with the anticipated increased
  New Zealand avocado earnings and continuing development of the Delicious Nutritious Food Company give Seeka a positive earnings
  outlook. Seeka is anticipating an improvement to earnings at an EBITDA level of between 5% and 10%.

Review of operations
Revenue for the twelve months ended December 2017 totalled $186.814m (2016: $191.317m). The reduction reflects lower total New
Zealand kiwifruit volumes handled from 32.438m trays to 25.675m trays, a decline of 21%. Hayward (green) volume declined by 33%.

Consolidated earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) totalled $23.128m (2016: $24.764m); down 6.61%.
EBITDA from Seeka Australia totalled $2.251m (2016: $1.029m); up 119%.

Seeka implemented a number of innovations to minimise the impact of lower New Zealand kiwifruit volumes along with concentrating
on the Australian business, the avocado business and emerging business units including the establishment of the Delicious Nutritious
Food Company.

Consolidated profit after tax for the year totalled $5.833m (2016: $10.385m); down 43.8%. It should be noted that the 2016 result
includes $3.092m in after tax one-off insurance proceeds.

Cash flow from operations totalled $14.058m (2016: $21.252m); down largely due to the gross insurance proceeds of $3.627m
received in 2016.

Cash invested in property, plant and equipment totalled $20.870m (2016: $40.920m); down on the previous corresponding period
(pcp). Major capital expenditure items included the installation of a new Compac grader at Main Road and the relocation of the
previous Main Road machine to the Peninsula packhouse. Capital works also included the construction of coolstores and pre-coolers
at Main Road, KKP and Transcool along with the programme of converting wooden bins to plastic.

Seeka’s New Zealand coolstore infrastructure is now largely in balance with expected crop volumes and the next large project under
consideration is replacement of the packing machine at KKP to handle expected greater Zespri Sungold volumes in 2019.

    Orchard operations in New Zealand
    Activities include the servicing and growing of kiwifruit, kiwiberry and avocados through managed, leased and long term leased
    arrangements. Orchard operations span from Northland through the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast.

    Kiwifruit volumes decreased in 2017 following an industry-wide drop in green kiwifruit yields. For the 2017 kiwifruit harvest Seeka
    grew 30.70m kilograms (8.45m trays) compared to 40.57m kilograms in 2016 (11.16m trays).

    In addition Seeka grew 0.54m kilograms of avocados (98,356 trays) in the 2016/17 harvest (2015/16: 0.054m kilograms, 9,739 trays).
    Seeka also grew 0.04m kilograms of kiwiberry (24,402 trays) for harvest 2017 (2016: 0.03m kilograms, 20,202 trays).

    Seeka is actively investing in long term leases to replace those which have expired.

    Total revenue for orchard operations for the year was $48.582m (2016: $47.889m). EBITDA of $6.376m (2016: $5.638m).

    Post harvest operations in New Zealand
    Coordinate the harvest, packing, storage and dispatch of kiwifruit, kiwiberry and avocados to the market, or in the case of Zespri
    kiwifruit to the port.

    In 2017 25.675m trays of New Zealand kiwifruit were packed (2016: 32.438m); a reduction of 6.724m trays being a direct effect of the
    industry-wide fall in Hayward (green) yields.

    Seeka delivered a safe and timely harvest to growers. The harvest was rain interrupted creating issues, however Seeka coordinated the
    harvest to optimise fruit quality and minimise fruit loss. A new Compac Spectrim grader was built and commissioned at Main Road
    with the previous machine relocated to the Peninsula packhouse in the Coromandel. New coolstores were built at Main Road, KKP and
    Transcool.

    Seeka innovated to mitigate the potential earnings impact of reduced volumes. Sensibly Seeka delayed capital expenditure and
    implemented procurement reviews that successfully reduced costs. Importantly Seeka developed a new capacity planning tool, called
    Blueprint. Blueprint has improved management’s ability to match expected harvested crop volumes with optimised plant utilisation
    and coolstore capacity. It also ensures that a grower’s fruit receives an optimal harvest, and Seeka is able to optimise packing, cooling
    and inventory management to minimise costs.

Hayward (green) conventional, 0.42% for Hayward (green) organic growers and 0.73% for Zespri SunGold growers.

Post-harvest revenue of $96.700m for the year is a reduction on the prior years $110.823m. EBITDA of $21.958m down on the prior

Revenue totalled $24.294m, ahead of the prior year of $16.847m. EBITDA of $2.920m compares favourably against pcp of $1.941m.

Avocado earnings continue to grow in importance in this division’s revenue and earnings and the tray return to growers continues to
lead the Industry. Seeka expects the current year sales programme (2017:2018) to approach $40 per export tray – well surpassing the
previous record of $26.80. Seeka has gained a brand reputation for supreme quality throughout the customer base – with our retail
customers able to rely on a supply chain that delivers them high quality fruit every time.

The tropical business including banana importation and ripening has delivered positive earnings. A decision by a key customer to
rearrange their supply chain and source bananas direct from the market and only use Seeka for ripening has led Seeka to impair the
goodwill associated with its sourcing contract by $2.031m.

Seeka has established a new business, the Delicious Nutritious Food Company as a wholly owned subsidiary. The business manufactures and
markets a range of kiwi crush products, manufactures and supplies avocado oil and will include the packing and distribution of kiwiberry. The
combined operations deliver a full year business cycle. EBITDA for the partial first year of manufacturing totalled $0.294m and is included in the
overall EBITDA for retail services.

     Seeka has concentrated on upgrading the orchards, post-harvest infrastructure, safety and business systems and the general
     presentation of the business in Australia.

     Seeka is further expanding its kiwifruit plantations with infill planting of existing orchards and the development of new orchards.
     The company has some 60 hectares of new kiwifruit orchards in development and purchased land adjacent to its existing orchards
     for further development. Developments will take three to five years to bear fruit, but Seeka is confident in both the orchards and
     Australian business.

Long range business planning has set AUD$8m as the targeted EBITDA for this business operation. Innovation includes new variety
trials which are underway. Seeka is introducing new hybrid pear varieties to replace some commodity pears on its orchard.

The Australian team is focused on improving the presentation and quality of fruit sold to market. Goulburn Valley is a highly regarded
fruit growing region in Australia with a hot climate, high sunshine hours and low rainfall. Fruit grown in this environment has high dry
matter and great taste and is well received by the market as confirmed by independent consumer studies.

Seeka is actively investing in its Australian business as a future growth platform establishing new orchards and introducing new varieties.
The quality of fruit grown in Australia, relatively low cost of establishment, established infrastructure and high value close domestic market
provides confidence in the investment programme.

EBITDA of $2.251m is a significant improvement on prior year EBITDA of $1.029m.


The Seeka team
Inspirational people is a hallmark of our brand and we have focused on our people development strategy to ensure that Seeka is well
resourced for the future.

Seeka is committed to the success of our people and has invested in the future by establishing a number of programmes. During the year
Seeka established a leadership development programme to ensure that the future leaders are fully equipped to continue the success and
growth of Seeka. Orchard cadetships are available for those looking to begin a career in horticulture and are exposed to the full remit of
orchard management and can go on to become trainee managers. Seeka has been collaborating with Te Awanui Kiwi Leaders initiative to
establish a fully-mentored cadet programme. Seeka also offers an overseas experience programme to selected employees.

The company has refined its health and safety strategy and systems to ensure that it complies with legislation and keeps its people,
contractors and stakeholders safe. Established key performance measures including Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR),
Notifiable Injuries, Notifiable Incidents and Severity Rate (average days lost from injury) as key performance indicators for the
company. The key performance indicators set with management staff include these key components.

The 2017 actual results and 2018 targets are shown in the following table below.

                                                                                                                    2018 Target             2017 Actuals

Safety systems continue to be refined and actively managed to ensure our people are safe. The Company is continuing to make
excellent progress with its health and safety strategy and deployment. Further Seeka continues to invest in training and systems,
to ensure contractor compliance. Non-compliant contractors are removed from the approved Company supplier list. Generally
contractors have worked cooperatively with Seeka to achieve compliance and Seeka is satisfied with the compliance of its contractor
community.

Seeka also has a team of dedicated employees to source and care for its seasonal workforce. This includes the overseas workforce recruited
under the RSE scheme which compliments the local New Zealand workforce. Our team ensures that we make all endeavours to employ New
Zealanders first, including working with the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment on innovative schemes. These schemes include
transport arrangements, training courses and innovative incentives to bring regional people to Seeka’s employment hubs.



1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of
hours worked. TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).
2. Severity rate = (number of lost time injuries) / (number of days lost).

     Seeka360 Campus
     Te Arikinui Kiingi Tuheitia opened Seeka’s new headquarters in March 2017. The building and campus is utilised by Seeka, its growers,
     and community.

     Progress is being made to address the deferred maintenance on the property and develop a commercial GEM avocado orchard to both
     showcase this variety and generate income from the previous amenity property.

     Seeka is now planning on relocating its laboratory operations from Te Puke to the Seeka360 hub to further create this produce centre
     of excellence.


     Innovation
     Seeka continues to invest in innovation to support operations, fruit performance, automation and operational efficiency.

     More recent innovations include information systems deployed by Seeka enabling faster decisions to be made at critical moments
     in the business cycle. Inventory managers are able to assess fruit in all stores, understand atmospheric conditions and fruit
     characteristics to prioritise fruit for optimal shipment to the market.

     Information systems have been deployed to improve planning in increasingly complex situations. Blueprint, Seeka’s innovation to the
     harvest of multiple varieties, maturities and sites, is now deployed in the business to improve operational efficiency.

     Seeka’s laboratory business, VLS, has continued to innovate to support growers and the business. Seeka has recently been awarded a
     contract to supply the kiwifruit industry with independent maturity testing services from 2018 – a highlight for Seeka.


     Summary
     Reduced New Zealand kiwifruit volumes primarily resulting from an industry-wide lower Hayward yield impacted negatively on
     Seeka’s earnings. The company responded to this challenge positively and innovated to mitigate the impact. Australian operations and
     Seeka avocados delivered improved earnings and the emerging Delicious Nutritious Food Company is now fully operational. Changes
     in the supply arrangements of a key customer led Seeka to impair the goodwill in its banana sourcing business.

     Seeka is constantly using innovative technological developments in the core kiwifruit business to optimise packhouse operations and
     deliver continuous improvement in performance to growers plus minimise cost to the company.

     Seeka would like to thank all stakeholders for their continued support and all growers who supply Seeka for choosing Seeka as their
     preferred supply partner.

     Seeka is well placed through the quality and focus of our people, our strategic investments in orchards and post harvest facilities, the
     broadening of our retail services business and the support of our shareholders.

The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
 • Leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts) whereby
   the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the orchard
   owners.
 • Leased land (long term contracts) which the Group has developed
   into productive orchards, pays all development and production
   costs, owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit
   with the landowner after all costs are recovered.

Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado and
kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the Group’s orchard
management and lease operations, plus crops from independent
orchard owners.




Turnover
Turnover (a non-GAAP measure) includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers where the Group acts as the agent, and
is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. (See note 2).

EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax. EBIT is an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the vendor by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.



In the second half of 2016 the Group entered a direct buying arrangement for the importation and supply of bananas in New Zealand whereby
total revenues and expenses are reported in the statement of financial performance. Previously the Group had imported bananas on an agency
arrangement whereby the Group only reported commission revenue.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2016 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.



Note 8. Events occurring after balance date
There are no material events occurring subsequent to balance date requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

     Crop where cost is deemed fair value
     Kiwifruit, Nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date and as
     such cost is deemed fair value (note 27).
     For each crop cost is tested for impairment at balance date using the Group budget for yields and market returns less costs yet to be incurred on
     an orchard-by-orchard basis to establish a recoverable value for the crop on each of the Group's orchards.
     Where the recoverable value is less than cost, the cost is impaired through the statement of financial performance.



     Accounting policies
     Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair value depends
     on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
     When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (provided the costs
     are considered recoverable).
     When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.
     The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference to current and expected sales returns when available. When market data
     is not available an assessment is made based on historical data.

Within current trade receivables, $1.10m are past due (Dec 2016 - $1.14m), of which 3.5% are more than 90 days (Dec 2016 - 5%). Non-current trade
receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up to five years.


Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be
able to collect all amounts due and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.

In the current year, $21.98m (Dec 2016 - $25.76m) of packaging inventory costs were expensed to cost of sales in the statement of financial performance.



Accounting policies
Raw materials, work in progress, finished goods and produce are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct
materials and direct labour, and are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average cost. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sales costs.

     The Board has assessed the fair value of the term loans as the outstanding balance at balance date.
     The Group’s bank facilities are held with Westpac and it is expected that all facilities will be refinanced when they become due for review in the
     normal course of business.
     The following table details the amounts of the term loans drawn down at balance date and their maturities.

     All of the Group’s term loans are on interest-only repayment terms.

     Assets pledged as security
     Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect the term
     portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates via the use of derivatives. See note 28.

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the number of fully
paid shares held.

Grower incentive scheme
On 7 September 2016, the Group issued 666,124 shares at a price of $4.40 each in respect of the 2016 kiwifruit supply season to participating
growers. No shares were issued in 2017.



Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

     Basic earnings per share
     Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
     ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the period.

     Diluted earnings per share
     Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
     effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
     to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

     Net tangible asset per share
     Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

Share based payment reserve
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan established in 2016.
The active scheme is managed by a trust established October 2014, and the directors of the trustee company (Seeka Employee Share Plan Trustee
Limited) are also directors of Seeka.
Under the employee share schemes shares are issued to an employee share trust, with certain employees eligible to subscribe to shares held by
the trust with this benefit recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the
vesting period the employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to them, alternatively the
employee can elect not to have the shares transferred to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees.

At balance date, the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted to employees and remain outstanding under the scheme
was 435,800 (Dec 2016 - 743,600), representing 2.51% (Dec 2016 - 4.43%) of the shares of the Company on issue at that date.
The shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust.
The shares held by the employee share scheme carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares. While monies are owed on the
shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the scheme is valued using a Black Scholes pricing model. Because the Company has a small market capitalisation with
minimal trading, volatility is forecasted into the model.
During the year the shares issued in 2014 vested with employees, with all but 77,500 shares transferred to employees. The remaining shares are
held by the trust for payment over two years with interest charged on the outstanding loan balance.

Purchase of shares in Rising Sun Orchards Limited
In October 2017 the Group purchased a 16.67% share in Rising Sun Orchards Limited; a company that purchased and operates a 28 canopy
hectare avocado orchard in Houhora, Northland, New Zealand.

Impairment of investment
The Group owns 32% of UPNZ Limited (UPNZ). During the 2016 financial year the Group fully impaired its $0.34m investment in UPNZ. UPNZ
imports plastic pocket packs from China and Chile and distributes them to the New Zealand kiwifruit industry. In late March 2016, a visual
inspection found grease deposits on several packs supplied by UPNZ. As a consequence Zespri Group Limited (Zespri) placed all kiwifruit packed
into UPNZ pocket packs sourced from China on hold until they could determine whether the grease posed any potential food safety issues. UPNZ
was forced to recall this product and as a result its customers, including Seeka, suffered costs checking the packed kiwifruit inventory to remove
all affected trays. The Board believes this will have a major impact on the value of the Group's investment in UPNZ and it was recognised as an
impairment in the statement of financial performance. No impairment was recognised in 2017.



Accounting policies
The fair values of the listed securities are based on the securities' closing share price at balance date. Where pricing information is available,
unlisted securities are revalued at balance date. All other unlisted securities are currently held at cost less impairment as it reasonably represents
current fair value. The carrying amount of all unlisted securities have been reviewed at balance date and any impairment is recognised through the
statement of comprehensive income to the extent of any related reserve available and then through the statement of financial performance.

     c. Liquidity risk
     Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
     The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure
     that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity
     requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.
     When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.
     At balance date, the Group had $116.2m (2016 - $114.8m) of available credit of which $85.5m (2016 - $74.4m) was drawn. All credit lines are
     currently provided by one finance provider.
     The following table details the remaining contractual maturities at balance date of the Group’s financial liabilities.

     d. Capital risk
     Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
     support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
     The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling
     assets.
     The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings times
interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants. Refer to note 15.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified on the statement of financial position either
as investment in shares and water shares within intangible assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities,
only some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity
reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The decision to change the fair value of an investment is recorded through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial performance
whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance was available. When no such reserve existed, any related loss is processed directly in the
statement of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.
The following table details interest rate and price sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their impact on the
statement of financial performance or equity. Cash and advance balances do not attract interest and are not subject to pricing risk,
and are therefore excluded from this analysis.

     Note 27. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
     The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
     The different levels are defined as:

     Our opinion
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company), including its
     subsidiaries (the Group), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as
     at 31 December 2017, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in
     accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS)
     and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

     Basis for opinion
     We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs
     NZ) and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are
     further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
     statements section of our report.

     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
     our opinion.

Our audit approach
Overview
                            An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
                            financial statements are free from material misstatement.
                            Overall group materiality: $1.9 million, which approximates 1% of
                            Group revenue.
                            We selected 1% of revenue as the benchmark for our materiality as we
                            consider this is an appropriate measure of performance of the Group.
                            The Group operates in a high volume low margin industry where net
                            profit is not representative of the scale of the Group.


                            Key Audit Matters
                                 Valuation of Biological Assets – crop
                                 Valuation of Land and Buildings




Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out
above. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit,
the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both
individually and in aggregate on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Audit scope
We designed our audit by assessing the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial
statements and our application of materiality. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of
management override of internal controls including among other matters, consideration of whether
there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.

We audited both the New Zealand and Australian operations of the Group at a materiality level
calculated by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the
business concerned or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes where the
statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation.

     Key audit matters
     Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
     our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in
     the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
     opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Information other than the financial statements and auditor’s report
The Directors are responsible for the annual report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements does not cover the other information included in the annual report and we do not and will
not express any form of assurance conclusion on the other information.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information
that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report
in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial statements
The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate
the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,

     but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs NZ and ISAs will always detect
     a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
     considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
     the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

     CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
     As at 31 December 2017

     At Seeka, we conduct our business sustainably, safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best
     outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.

     Seeka supports the NZX Corporate Governance Code 2017 (the Code), and Seeka’s Board has reviewed and refined the company’s
     corporate governance policies against the eight principles of the Code.

     Seeka’s corporate governance statement and governance policies are available on Seeka’s website Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.

     The following is a summary of Seeka’s governance actions and performance against each of the Code’s eight principles during the
     reporting period. Seeka’s governance complies with the Code, with exceptions to any principle noted in this governance statement, and
     listed on page 66 of this annual report.

     The Board approved this governance statement on 23 February 2018.


     Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
     “Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards
     being followed throughout the organisation.”

     Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce
     business that connects growers with customers. Our business spans, cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors
     and management understand that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders,
     customers and communities.

     Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s published core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”

     Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs and available on Seeka’s intranet. The code outlines how directors and
     management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders,
     adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”

     The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:

       • Conflicts of interest

       • Use of Seeka information, assets and property

       • Dealing with gifts or gratuities

       • Respecting all stakeholders

       • Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing

       • Compliance with laws and Seeka policies

       • Managing any breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics

     Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy prohibiting the direct or indirect dealing of Seeka securities when holding inside information,
     plus a duty of confidentiality that protects the dissemination and use of confidential company information.


     Principle 2. Board composition and performance
     “To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspective.”

     Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interest of the company, deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.


     Board charter and responsibilities
     The Board’s charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along
     with the duties and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is responsible for:

       • Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards

       • Establishing corporate objectives and strategies

       • Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies

       • Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance

       • Managing risk to Seeka’s business

58     • Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication                                                                Seeka annual report 2017
The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal
representative. The chief executive officer is not a Board member.

The Board Charter was established December 2017. Prior to the charter, the Board operated to the same set of principles defined in the
charter.


Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for
an eighth to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings. Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support
Seeka’s objectives and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain
proper separation between governance and management, all directors are non-executive and the constitution has no provision for a
managing director.

Seeka’s Board currently has seven directors, led by the Independent Chairman Fred Hutchings, who joined the board in September 2012.
Non-independent director Amiel Diaz is the only director residing overseas.

The following table summarises director qualifications, skills and experience.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all
relevant information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.

Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;

  • Amiel Diaz, representative of Seeka’s largest shareholder Farmind Corporation of Japan, and

  • Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka’s largest New Zealand shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chairman of the Ngai
    Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit grower supplying Seeka.

As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors
have extensive experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are
considered non-independent directors;

  • Martyn Brick

  • John Burke, and

  • Ratahi Cross

The Board has three independent directors;

  • Fred Hutchings, Chairman

  • Ashley Waugh, audit and risk committee chairman, and

  • Cecilia Tarrant.


Director appointments and induction
As required the Chairman establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend
people with complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by
shareholders at the next annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder
meeting. The Board provides guidance to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability before any vote.

                                                                                                                                                                         59
     In 2017, following 15 years of service Malcolm Cartwright retired as a director. A nominations committee was formed to identify a replacement,
     with Cecilia Tarrant recommended to shareholders and subsequently elected by shareholders at the 27 April 2017 annual shareholder meeting.

     Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the company’s
     strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
     Board.

     The Chairman undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the
     nominations committee.


     Director profiles
     Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 67 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
     director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 69 of this annual report.


     Diversity
     Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a
     deeper understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.

     The Board works to optimise diversity across director members, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity
     in culture and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key
     clients, creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns.

     With Seeka’s key client groups diversely spread from rural New Zealand to large urban centres in Asia, Seeka’s Board has encompassed cultural,
     ethnical and gender diversity to strengthen business governance:

       • Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is also a lecturer in Maori history

       • Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia

       • Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural backgrounds

     The following table reports gender composition of the Board and senior management team as at 31 December 2017.

     Diversity Policy
     Seeka is committed to providing an inclusive environment that supports a diversity of thinking and skills. This policy formalises the existing
     conduct of the Board and management. Aspects of diversity include gender, ethnic background, religion, marital status, culture, disability,
     economic background, education, language, physical appearance and sexual orientation.

     During the year ended 31 December 2017, Seeka performed in adherence to its diversity policy.


     Principle 3. Board committees
     “The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”

     The Board has established permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
     functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.

All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and
committee members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited
by the committee. Committee charters are reviewed annually by the Board.


Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member Board with three independent directors. To provide effective and transparent committee
governance, while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an
independent director, with committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill
set.

The current standing committees are:

The Nominations Committee Charter was established December 2017. Prior to the charter, the Chairman established ad-hoc Board
meetings to examine Board succession plans, evaluate nominees and assess director performance.

In the event of a takeover offer, the Board Charter provides for the formation of an ad-hoc takeovers committee to operate under a written
charter.

A formal charter for the takeovers committee has not been established, and to date there has been no need to form a takeovers
committee.

While the Board considers the current range of committees comprehensively manages the governance of Seeka’s business, and provides
the best outcomes for shareholders and other stakeholders, the Board Charter allows ad-hoc committees to be formed as required to aid
Board decision making.

     Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
     “The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”

     Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the
     company’s operating environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka
     provides stakeholders with a mid-year performance update, along with regular operational updates to supplying clients.

     Seeka follows NZX continuous disclosure guidelines for the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and
     other stakeholders. The Chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer are responsible for identifying material information between
     Board meetings, with continuous disclosure covered at every Board meeting. Seeka’s Code of Ethics, Board and committee charters and
     policies as recommended in the Code are available on Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/corporate-governance.

     As stewards of more than 230 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and
     international guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes following the international GLOBALG.A.P
     standard for good agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food.

     Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
     communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health,
     safety and welfare.

     In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower
     fruit value; kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers
     appointing AvoFresh Limited.

     Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions
     and grower payments, and publish independently-audited annual statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils,
     provides management support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s
     operational performance for their fruit.

     Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013
     and the NZX Listing Rules. Seeka also supports environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any
     environmental factors that may materially affect operations.


     Principle 5. Remuneration
     “The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”


     Director remuneration
     In accordance with the Board Charter, the Chairman uses professional advice and market information to review director remuneration
     within a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last
     sought in April 2015, when the pool limit was set at $400,000 per annum. Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according
     to expected time commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board. Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and
     receive no performance or retirement benefits. Directors are not required to own Seeka shares.

The base director fee includes remuneration for committee membership.


Chief executive officer remuneration
The review of the chief executive’s remuneration is undertaken by the remunerations committee with the remuneration package the
responsibility of the Board.

Michael Franks was appointed chief executive in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual remuneration that covers
base salary, vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.

The following table reports chief executive remuneration in 2017.


                                                                                                   Annual performance

 1. Benefits are delivered through vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance.

 2. Performance incentive earned from FY16 and paid in 2017.

Performance incentive

The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 40% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set
by the Board, including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For the 2016 financial year, chief
executive officer Michael Franks earned an $182,500 performance incentive. This payment was made in 2017.

For the 2017 financial year, the chief executive officer earned a $156,800 performance incentive. This payment will be made in 2018.

Employee share scheme

Chief executive Michael Franks was allocated 15,000 shares at $3.05 per share under the 2014 employee share scheme. In 2017, these
shares vested, were taken up and issued to the chief executive at $2.372 per share.

At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated at $3.88 per share under the 2016 employee share scheme. These shares
vest in 2019.


Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should
regularly verify that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”

The Board consider risk management a major governance function that protects all stakeholders, builds long-term wealth in our
communities and optimises shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate control of risk management, with the audit and risk committee
providing a specific focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.




                                                                                                                                                     63
     Business risks are identified, recorded on a risk register, assessed, managed through risk mitigation strategies and reviewed at least
     annually.

     Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess
     business performance against budget and forecasts.

     The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian
     produce handling and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia to ensure all directors
     understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.

     The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk
     associated with being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian
     market and sourcing revenue from more points along the value chain. Since the incursion of the kiwifruit vine-killing disease Psa in 2010,
     Seeka has transformed from being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler to become an Australasian produce business involved in the growing,
     handling, supply and marketing of multiple products.


     Health and safety
     Operating in a seasonal industry, in 2017 Seeka employed more than 3,900 people working in multiple complex environments. This
     includes 24-hour operations over the harvest period. Group salary and wages equate to 1,175 full time equivalents.

     The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager
     to ensure Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of
     health and safety risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.

     The following table reports key health and safety measures in 2017 and 2018 targets.


                                                                                                        2018 Annual threshold               2017 Actuals

      1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of
      hours worked. TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).

      2. Severity rate = (number of lost time injuries) / (number of days lost).



     Principle 7. Auditors
     “The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”

     Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and
     the markets with objective, clear and timely financial reporting.

     The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the
     external audit process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor.
     The audit and risk committee:

       • Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments,
         and

       • Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.

     For financial year 2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for Seeka Limited, having been reappointed Seeka’s
     auditor under the Companies Act 1993 at the 2017 annual shareholder meeting. PwC have confirmed their independence to the audit and
     risk committee, and their independence was not compromised during the reporting period. The last audit partner rotation was in FY16.

     PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.




64                                                                                                                                                         Seeka annual report 2017
Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational
data. This includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring
management’s response to external audit findings.

Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s
financial systems.


Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to
engage with the issuer.”

Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities.
Seeka maintains open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering
excellence to all stakeholders.

The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:

  • Annual and interim reports

  • Market announcements

  • Annual shareholder meeting

  • Mid-year stakeholder meeting

  • Ad-hoc investor presentations

  • Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type

  • Quarterly all staff updates

  • Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors

  • Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update, where they can raise
matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which affect Seeka at the annual
shareholder meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the company’s
