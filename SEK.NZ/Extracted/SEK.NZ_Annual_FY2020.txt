FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

It is our pleasure to provide you with this commentary on Seeka’s financial and operational performance for the year ended
31 December 2020. Without doubt, 2020 was the most challenging year since Psa impacted the kiwifruit industry.

This report provides details on the audited results for the 12 months, operational performance of our business segments, the
impact of Covid-19, health and safety, Seeka’s strategy, capacity and automation, the Seeka team, shareholder dividends and
business outlook.

Covid-19, drought, a change to kiwifruit clearance protocols and severe labour shortages created unprecedented operational
and financial challenges for our New Zealand and Australian businesses. While contending with additional costs from stringent
hygiene protocols, Seeka received no Government wage subsidy in 2020.

Despite the challenges, the Group successfully completed all harvests; an outstanding achievement by our people who continued
to provide an essential service as Covid-19 posed a very real threat to their health and the welfare of their whānau. Our people
responded with commitment and innovation, drawing together as a team to deliver a timely harvest to our growers and business
continuity to our stakeholders. This continued into the second half of the year with the New Zealand avocado and Australian
pear and apricot harvests. Seeka strives to provide our customers with a reliable supply of high-quality produce as we manage
challenges across our supply chain. For example, nearly every consignment of Seeka New Zealand avocados experienced
significant disruption.

Our teams continued to excel and their commitment and drive have delivered our shareholders and growers outstanding results.
The team focussed on getting the job done.

Seeka delivered a higher profit despite facing higher costs, a limited labour force and lower fruit volumes from summer drought.
The company lowered debt and maintained shareholder dividends, and our customers were delighted with the quality of our
produce.

Improving underlying financial performance is a key focus for the company.

Seeka continued to sell down Northland orchards and has sold and leased back three Australian kiwifruit orchards. Taking more
than 12 months to transact, the Australian sale realised profit, lowered debt and provides confidence to continue developing
Australian orchards.

Finally, by way of introduction, Seeka progressed initiatives that address the risks and opportunities of climate change. The
Board established a sustainability committee to work with management and develop actions and strategies to become a more
sustainable business. Seeka’s second annual sustainability report is included in this document with work underway to ensure
Seeka’s environmental, social and governance initiatives will be a feature of stakeholder reporting.

Review of operations
Financial
Revenue for the twelve months ended 31 December 2020 increased 6% to $251.46m (pcp: $236.87m). Consolidated earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $42.95m (pcp: $34.52m); up 24%. Profit before tax improved
by $6.42m (65%) to $16.28m and profit after tax improved by $8.27m (120%) to $15.15m.

These results include a number of gains from the continuing orchard sales along with significant improvements in Australian and
retail services operations.

Gains on orchard sales include:

–   $2.8m from the sale of Northland orchards, and

–   $6.2m from the sale and leaseback of three Australian kiwifruit orchards. The gain on sale is calculated under NZ IFRS 16
    which considers leaseback commitment.

Results were impacted by:

–   $3.1m direct costs of Covid-19,

–   $2.2m from productivity losses and Covid-19-related constraints, and

–   $5.0m from the estimated effects of the drought on Hayward production volumes.

Additionally, there was a deferred tax benefit of $5.6m from the reintroduction of tax deductibility of depreciation on buildings.

Net cash flow from operations totalled $26.35m, compared against $18.59m in the pcp.

Seeka received $43.04m in proceeds from properties held for sale (pcp: $44.53m) and invested $13.50m in property, plant and
equipment (pcp: $34.67m). In addition, Seeka invested $6.78m in long term leased orchards in New Zealand, $1.07m in orchard
developments in Australia and $1.00m in the Wai O Kaha Gold Landowners Limited Partnership. Working with the Provincial
Growth Fund and local hapū, this partnership is developing 40 hectares of Hayward orchards at Raukokore on the East Cape.

Net debt at 31 December 2020 was $77.85m (pcp: $116.79m) (bank loans less bank deposits); a decrease of $38.93m, driven by
the planned disposals of orchards held for sale. This reduction reflects our strategy of reducing bank borrowings used to acquire
Northland kiwifruit orchards and business from T&G, and Aongatete Coolstores Limited. Seeka continues to review its asset
holdings to ensure they are consistent with strategy and earn the cost of capital.

New Zealand orchard operations
Orchard operations span from Northland through to the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast, with orcharding covering the
growing of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry on leased, long term leased, and Seeka-owned orchards. This business also provides
comprehensive orchard management and vine management services to orchard owners and develops orchards under contract
for landowners under long term leases, including in partnership with iwi.

12.98m trays of kiwifruit were grown in 2020, compared to 11.42m trays in the pcp. For the second year, Hayward volumes were
affected by drought, being down an estimated 0.5m trays. At an average 10,200 trays per hectare in 2020, Hayward yields were
below the five-year average of 10,800 trays per hectare. While we expect drought to become more common in the future, the
2021 outlook is an improvement in volumes and fruit size, particularly for Hayward.

Seeka also grew 1,041,677 kilograms of avocado (pcp: 732,000 kgs) and 171,750 kilograms of kiwiberry (pcp: 64,400 kgs).

Orchard operations revenue of $75.71m is up $3.29m from the pcp reflecting higher returns from Zespri, higher avocado returns
and the sale of a small amount of SunGold license.

EBITDA for the year totalled $5.44m compared to pcp $4.99m after paying higher labour and compliance costs.

Seeka has a strategy to continue investing in long term leases to secure supply, with fruit volumes set to increase as these
orchards reach maturity. This includes the $1m investment in the Wai O Kaha Landowners Limited Partnership in conjunction
with local Raukokore hapū and the Provincial Growth Fund. In addition, we are developing a new seven-hectare SunGold orchard
in partnership with Ngāti Pūkenga in Welcome Bay.

New Zealand post harvest operations
Post harvest operates eight major facilities spread throughout the major growing regions in the North Island, and handles all
produce from our orcharding operations and from our independent growers.

In 2020, Seeka packed 33.4m trays of kiwifruit (pcp: 33.5m), down on expectation as drought impacted volumes by an estimated
2.4m trays, along with a loss of supply as new maturity protocols caused a short-term harvest rush whereby the volumes of fruit
deemed mature for harvest outstripped our capacity over a short period. Post harvest packed 760,000 trays of avocados and
82,000 trays of kiwiberry as well as contract packing citrus and blueberries in Kerikeri.

Post harvest revenue of $140.09m is similar to last season (pcp: $140.11m) reflecting a shorter storage year and selling season.
Costs increased from Covid-19 protocols, lower than expected volumes, and higher wage rates. EBITDA of $41.87m, while up on
the pcp’s $40.98m, is down on expectation.

New Zealand retail services operations
Includes the supply, export and sale of avocados, kiwiberry and class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, sale of New Zealand kiwifruit
through collaborative programmes, operation of the New Zealand wholesale marketing business including imported tropical
fruits, and the manufacture and sale of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.

A remarkable increase in revenue was achieved with a total of $21.80m compared to pcp of $12.30m (up 77%).

EBITDA of $3.00m is 79.6% up on the pcp’s $1.67m. This was achieved from a sound strategy and good execution of the plan.
Momentum continues to build with vibrant leadership, dedicated staff, great customer relationships, and high quality produce.

Australia operations
Seeka Australia Pty Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned company, leases and operates kiwifruit orchards, and owns and operates
nashi and pear orchards along with associated post harvest facilities in Victoria, directly marketing Seeka’s Australian produce
domestically and to export customers.

Kiwifruit yields were lower than expected following a very hot and dry summer which impacted fruit size. The kiwifruit business,
however, remains profitable. Green nashi sales returned to profitability as Seeka balanced supply to demand. Seeka sold its first
crop of the exciting new Ricó pear variety in 2020.

Total revenue for the year of $13.06m compares to pcp of $11.59m. EBITDA of $7.44m includes a $6.18m gain on sale of
Australian kiwifruit orchards. This delivered operational EBITDA of $1.26m which compares against negative $0.63m in the pcp.
The gain on sale is calculated in accordance with NZ IFRS 16 which takes into account the future lease liability with the sale price
much higher than the asset’s historical carrying value.

A tremendous job by our Australian team has made the business profitable. They executed a strategy that supplied profitable
product lines and delivered our customers excellent produce.

The sale of the mature kiwifruit orchards for AU$26.5m has reduced debt and yielded profit. Seeka has a further 63 hectares of
kiwifruit in development and a further 11 hectares of Ricó pears coming into production, and are trialling exciting new nashi pear
varieties.

Seeka remains positive about its Australian investment strategy.

Avocados and kiwiberry positive highlights
Seeka continues to build its emerging categories of kiwiberry and avocado. These varieties positively contribute to Seeka’s
earnings while delivering competitive returns to growers.

82,000 trays of kiwiberry were successfully harvested and marketed directly and in collaboration with Freshmax. Grower orchard
gate returns averaged an estimated $220,000 per hectare with the highest return over $320,000.

Likewise, Seeka’s avocado business continues to grow delivering supplying growers a premium return for their crop, while lifting
shareholder returns by utilising plant and equipment outside of the kiwifruit season.

These categories are sold under the Seeka brand, which is building a solid reputation for quality. Seeka is creating retail consumer
demand that generates superior returns to our growers.

Impact of Covid-19
Seeka proactively prepared for Covid-19 with a response committee formed prior to harvest and lockdown. The committee
included senior operational and support managers who prepared and executed mechanisms to ensure the safety of our people.
Actions included moving workers sourced from overseas through the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) programme to less
densely populated accommodation facilities. Quarantine facilities were established to house overseas workers who may have
Covid-19 like symptoms to separate them from others; this provided an excellent buffer when the normal winter flu symptoms
arrived.

When a manager of a third-party local accommodation facility was confirmed as Covid-19 positive, Seeka transferred people to
Seeka's quarantine facility until they tested negative. Seeka worked closely with the health professionals managing the Covid-19
response. The committee also sourced items including masks, gloves, sanitiser and thermometers well ahead of lockdown along
with protocols to achieve physical distancing and temperature monitoring.

Seeka’s packhouses and sites were established as “bubbles” with a total ban on personnel moving between facilities. Should
Seeka face a lockdown again, these procedures will be reinstated. The response committee continues to meet regularly and is
ensuring full preparedness for the coming 2021 harvests.

Covid-19 meant many of our experienced overseas workers were unable to return to New Zealand. The number of RSEs in New
Zealand and able to work further reduced as we responsibly aided their return once their work programme completed and they
requested to return home. We facilitated repatriation flights on their behalf. The number of continuing RSE workers for 2021 is
critically low. Seeka expects to have 460 RSEs for 2021 compared to a normal complement of 1180.

Seeka is operating a recruitment programme to attract New Zealanders to orchard work. Collaborating with the Ministry of Social
Development, the Ministry of Primary Industries, Te Arawa and Ngāti Hine, our training and induction programme is helping
interested people become “employment ready”. We are making every effort to fill the seasonal workforce, delivering training
on the available work, safety practices, well-being assessments, and skill-based training including forklift driving. This initiative
complements our long-standing orchard and post harvest cadet pathway.

Labour costs are expected to increase 18% in 2021, impacting orcharding and post harvest costs.

We worked to proactively ensure all our people were safe and in addition to our ongoing traffic management plans and guarding
upgrades we rolled out new Covid-19 protocols, including:
–   New access and egress processes ensure physical distancing,
–   New temporary tearooms,
–   Access to gloves, masks and hand sanitiser,
–   Strict 24-hour cleaning regime across all sites,
–   Work bubbles with personnel prohibited from travelling between facilities,
–   Limited site access from contractors and outside personnel,
–   Developed and deployed screens to ensure two metres of separation on all packing lines, and
–   Seeka’s wholesale markets continued to operate as an essential service, with strict physical distancing protocols.

Seeka estimates Covid-19 added $5.3m of costs to harvest 2020; $3.1m of direct Covid-19 operating costs plus $2.2m from
volume loss due to extraordinary productivity constraints.

Health and safety
This season's lockdown placed significant load on our safety programme, which was exacerbated by the severe shortage of
people. Seeka took all efforts to ensure that we kept our people safe and invested in their safety. We focus on continuous
improvement to ensure the health and safety of all personnel at all locations, with all reported incidents and near-misses
investigated. We reviewed and improved traffic management systems, installed new barriers at post harvest sites, rolled out new
fatigue-management systems, and invested in machine guarding. Forklifts are now largely segregated from post harvest areas
with foot traffic. Seeka has reviewed its tractor fleet and purchased 30 new tractors for 2021 harvest operations at a cost of over
$1m.

Disappointingly, after lockdown ended there were two post harvest serious harm incidents involving forklifts, and one in orchard
operations involving the loading of a tractor for transportation. These impacted the severity rate in the period. All incidents were
reviewed, including independent review of the post harvest incidents, as the company relentlessly drives for a safer environment.
Seeka continues to refine its safety focus.

The following table shows key safety measures against annual thresholds.

Strategic highlights
While continuity of operations was the major focus throughout the lockdown, Seeka was able to make significant strategic
progress in 2020. Kiwifruit is our core product, with the company diversifying geographically and targeting complementary
produce categories. The focus is on growth that delivers accretive value to our stakeholders, including shareholders, growers,
employees, contractors and community. We work to deliver our marketers, principally Zespri, the highest quality fruit and deliver
our growers great returns through our supply chain.

Seeka has excelled where it operates the entire value chain from the orchard to the customer and delivered incremental
returns to growers; as demonstrated by avocados and kiwiberry. We deliver orchard-to-market excellence in New Zealand
kiwifruit, avocados, class 2 kiwifruit, and kiwiberry, along with Australian kiwifruit, nashi and European pears, and have achieved
an excellent improvement in the operational and financial performance of our New Zealand retail services and Australian
businesses.

Seeka has focussed on consolidating its position, refining its management structures, and selling orchards with secure supply
contracts to reset debt while pursuing operational excellence.

The company has focussed on asset utilisation and capacity planning and has substantially built the infrastructure to handle the
anticipated immediate volumes. Seeka has deliberately positioned itself in Northland to provide excellent service to the region’s
growth in avocados and kiwifruit and has increased its avocado market share.

Capacity and automation
Analysis of future crop volumes indicate that Seeka has sufficient post harvest capacity for the 2021 and 2022 seasons,
with additional capacity required for 2023. The company is evaluating options for capacity expansion and is considering the
development of a new post harvest complex on the Pukenga Orchard in Young Road, Te Puke. The Board is expected to consider
this investment mid-year with any construction occurring in 2022.

Seeka continues to evaluate and deploy automation and information systems to drive efficiency, including in-shed automation
technology that reduces labour. New on-orchard scanning technology is providing an exciting opportunity to improve on-orchard
efficiency and reduce costs. By providing accurate measurements, the technology will improve winter pruning, crop optimisation
and crop estimation.

The Seeka team
We are very proud of the performance and commitment of all employees in what was a challenging year both operationally and
personally for everyone.

We have a clear strategy to be the employer of choice in a tight labour market. The company has increased wages and continued
to implement competitive remuneration levels. Talent development is one of our key platforms and we have created new joint
ventures to recruit and train New Zealanders to work in our industry.

Seeka actively sources New Zealand workers to fulfil peak seasonal labour demand and operates in parallel a RSE programme
that delivers focussed pastoral care for our overseas’ workers. Of our 3,500 strong seasonal workforce, 1,073 were scheduled to
come from overseas via this scheme. Seeka remains engaged with the New Zealand Government, noting that even with higher
domestic unemployment there remains insufficient local seasonal labour to safely undertake the harvests.

Dividend
A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid 30 March 2021 to
all shareholders on the register at 5pm on 5 March 2021. The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the
strike price. The total dividends distributed or declared in the 12 months to 31 December 2020 is $0.22 per share (12 months to
31 December 2019 - $0.24).

Outlook
Seeka remains focussed on delivering its strategy to deliver incremental earnings and returns to both shareholders and growers.
Lifting the base business operating profits is one of our strategic platforms. While kiwifruit is Seeka’s foundation crop, the
company also has a growing fruit bowl including avocados, kiwiberry, nashi and European pears across New Zealand and
Australia. We are a growth company and we continue to focus on profitable growth.

Additional capacity is required for the 2023 season with key investment decisions to be made in 2021.

Summary
We are proud of how the company has performed in an unprecedented, challenging environment. Covid-19 tested the resilience
of our people, but with their dedication and leadership the Seeka team and our community got the job done.

The company is responding to a changing climate and environment by the creation of a Board sustainability committee and
targeted initiatives intended to "Grow a Better Future", as detailed in the sustainability report.

Seeka ends the year having achieved a record profit, maintained dividends and significantly lowered debt. We are ready and
prepared to continue our growth journey knowing that lifting base profitability is a key strategic platform.

We thank all growers, shareholders and stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willingly give to Seeka.

The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard
owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry crops from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts)
  whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the
  orchard owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into
  productive orchards, pays all development and production costs,
  owns all crops for the term of the lease, and shares profit with the
  landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest
  costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado,
citrus, berry, and kiwiberry industries. This includes all crops from the
Group’s orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from
independent orchard owners.




EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2019 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;
actual tax payable is limited to the reversal of tax depreciation claimed on that asset in prior period tax returns.
Legislation enacted 25 March 2020 reinstated tax depreciation deductions on non-residential buildings. This resulted in a one-off $5.6m gain in
the income tax calculation for the 2020 financial year, see note 6.

     than 12 months. The Group used judgement to classify the Australian sale and leaseback as an asset held for sale and estimates to calculate and
     judgementally recognise the gain on sale. This included judging the right of use lease asset, lease liability, lease term and estimated discount rate.

Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
appropriate asset class. At 31 December 2020 the assets under construction relate to the Kerikeri coolstore build, which is stage 2 of the Kerikeri
Capital Project. Stage 1 was the packhouse build, which was completed in 2019.
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus any
subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by TelferYoung Valuers,
ANZIV, independent registered valuer.
In Australia valuations are undertaken by Preston Rowe Paterson Shepparton (previously known as Goulburn Valley Property Services),
independent valuers, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia. All Australian land and buildings were revalued at 31 December 2019.
The valuers consider four different approaches in concert to arrive at a fair value;
 1. Direct replacement cost - adds the value of the land to the replacement cost of the buildings and other improvements based on the current cost
     of construction less depreciation based on the age of the building with an allowance for physical depreciation. Specific consideration is given to
     the 'optimised depreciated replacement cost' methodology.
 2. Sales comparison - considers sales of other comparable properties.

 3. Capitalisation of rentals - assumes a hypothetical lease of the property with a current market rental being established and capitalising this at an
     appropriate rate of return (6.25% – 10.5%) that would be expected by a prudent investor. The 2020 year saw capitalisation rates fall between
     0.5% - 0.75% since the previous valuations.
 4. Discounted cash flow - a variation of the investment method whereby it takes the current market rental calculated under the investment
    method and forecasts net cash flows over a ten-year period. Cash flows are adjusted for expected growth in market rentals and estimated costs
    incurred to maintain land and buildings in operational use. This method assumes land and buildings are sold in the terminal year (year 11).
The net book value of land is $23.43m (Dec 2019 - $23.37m) and buildings is $147.14m (Dec 2019 - $131.14m), see note 29.

The following table details the gain on revaluation of land and buildings recognised in the revaluation reserve, net of tax of $10.43m (Dec 2019 -
$3.20m).

As a consequence of the building revaluations conducted in December 2020, $5.90m (Dec 2019 - $3.71m) of accumulated depreciation was
offset directly against the assets' cost or valuation, prior to revaluation.

Impairment of bearer plants
For the year ended 31 December 2020, $0.03m of cherries were at the end of their useful life and removed with the remaining costs impaired.
For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group replaced some Australian bearer plants as a result of the Psa disease being identified on new
grafts. This resulted in an impairment and the write off of the carrying value of bearer plants of $0.40m which was recognised in the statement of
financial performance. There is no significant impairment relating to bearer plants in the year ended 31 December 2020.

    Critical accounting estimates and judgements
    At 31 December 2020 a significant portion of Seeka's land and building portfolio was revalued. Seeka’s property values significantly increased
    in the last year due to an increase in market demand for industrial properties. Seeka operates in the food production industry, which remained
    stable with a high demand for healthy foods during the Covid-19 pandemic. Properties situated in the Bay of Plenty are also expected to be less
    affected than other regions given the ongoing strength of horticulture and agriculture businesses.
    Seeka’s Australian properties are in the food production region of Victoria. The sale and leaseback transaction completed on 15 December
    supports the carrying values of the remaining properties.
    Sensitivity analysis suggests the remaining properties that were not revalued this year could cause an increase in land and buildings of a
    further 2-4%. This is not considered a material movement in land and building values.

Additions
On 15 December 2020, the Group completed a sale and leaseback transaction for three kiwifruit orchards totalling 199 hectares in Australia.
The completion of this sale created a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability, with the difference between the two recognised as a gain on
sale through the statement of financial performance, see note 9.
On 30 September 2019 of the prior year, the Group entered into the sale and leaseback transaction for an orchard in Northland. The lease was
for 15 years. A right of use asset and lease liability was calculated using the incremental borrowing rate, with the difference representing a gain
on sale in 2019.

December 2020 prepaid deposits incorporated $1.5m of deposits for avocado trees not yet received (Dec 2019 - $1.8m).
Accrued income and other sundry receivables includes income to be received from orcharding operations over leased and owned orchards
relating to 484 hectares (Dec 2019 - 481 hectares).
Within current trade receivables, $1.97m are past due (Dec 2019 - $2.13m), of which 1.6% are more than 90 days (Dec 2019 - 2.6%). Non-current
trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up to five years.
A $0.16m provision for doubtful debts was recognised in the financial statements (Dec 2019 - $0.13m).



Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.



     Critical accounting estimates and judgements
     The Group reviewed trade and other receivables for any debtor impairment, credit risk, or any other such risks that may result in non-
     payment. The Group did not identify any circumstances that required further provisioning or impairment of financial instruments.

In the current year, $27.48m (Dec 2019 - $28.89m) of packaging inventory costs were expensed to cost of sales in the statement of financial
performance.



Accounting policies
Raw materials, work in progress, finished goods and produce are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct
materials and direct labour, and are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average cost. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sales costs.

Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect the term
portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates via the use of derivatives, see note 30.




Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Grower loyalty share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share
scheme, whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares based on their orchard's current or forecast production. This issue of up
to 2.6m shares was approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
In April 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 405 participating growers. The issue price of $4.76 per share was
funded by the Group making a $9.8m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying all product
from the participating orchards for three consecutive seasons, participating growers can elect to pay the outstanding balance of their loans, less any
dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them. Shares issued under this scheme vest in 2021 and 2022.
Employee share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible employees to participate in a five-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would
be allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business. In April 2019, 568,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf
of 319 participating employees. The issue price of $4.76 per share was funded by the Group making a $2.7m non-interest-bearing loan to the
trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can elect to pay
the outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them. Shares issued
under this scheme vest in 2022.



Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

The goodwill was allocated to the post harvest and orchard segments and is attributable to the operation’s strong position in the Bay of Plenty and
synergies expected to arise after adding additional post harvest and orchard facilities to Seeka’s operations. The goodwill is not expected to be
impaired in the foreseeable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of $0.20m were
included in administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $2.9m was provided in relation to differences between tax values and the fair value of certain
assets.
Land and buildings were valued using an independent valuation completed by Telfer Young Valuers using the same approach as other land and
buildings detailed in note 10.
No changes have been made since 31 December 2019.


     Critical accounting estimates and judgements
     Business combination requires the use of estimates to determine the fair value of the acquisition's assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.

The share reserve is used to record the value of option benefits recognised on the Group's grower loyalty and employee share schemes as detailed
in this note.
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
– An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
– An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust
deed established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from
the sale of shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.
The following table details movement in the share reserve relating to the employee share scheme.

Grower loyalty share scheme
Under the grower loyalty share schemes shares are issued to a share trust in return for a debt owned back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvests through to 31 March 2022. The option
benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the grower has an option to settle any
outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to them. Alternatively the grower can elect not to have the shares transferred
to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from the sale of
shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.

For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust of behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.
The following table details inputs to the Black Scholes pricing model, used to value the cost of the share schemes to the Group.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

                                                                                                                              2020               2019

The Group is subject to, and monitors, financial covenants imposed by its lenders, including maintenance of equity ratios and earnings times
interest cover. At no stage during the year did the Group breach any of its lending covenants.

e. Price risk - equity securities
The Group has minor exposure to equity securities price risk through incidental investments classified in the statement of financial position either
as investment in shares and water shares within intangible assets at fair value. The majority of these investments are in industry-related entities,
only some of which are publicly traded.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity investments with all other variables held constant, has minimal impact on the Group's profit and equity
reserves.
The Board periodically reviews the performance and strategic benefits of these investments. No other formal risk management procedures are
deemed necessary.
The change in the fair value of an investment is recorded through other comprehensive income or the statement of financial performance
whenever a previous revaluation reserve balance was available. When no such reserve existed, any related loss is processed directly in the
statement of financial performance, otherwise available reserves are utilised to offset the loss.

f. Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group's cash flow interest rate risk arises primarily from short and long-term variable rate borrowings from financial institutions. The Board
continuously reviews term borrowings and uses interest rate swaps to hold a portion of borrowings at fixed rates; these are designated as effective
hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied.
The following table details interest rate and price sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and their impact on the statement of
financial performance or equity. Cash and advance balances do not attract interest and are not subject to pricing risk, and are therefore excluded
from this analysis.

       Independent auditor’s report
       To the Shareholders of Seeka Limited

       Our opinion
       In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Seeka Limited (the Company),
       including its subsidiaries (the Group), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
       the Group as at 31 December 2020, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended
       in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ
       IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
       What we have audited
       The Group's consolidated financial statements comprise:
           ●   the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;
           ●   the statement of financial performance for the year then ended;
           ●   the statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
           ●   the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
           ●   the statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
           ●   the notes to the financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other
               explanatory information.

       Basis for opinion
       We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) (ISAs
       (NZ)) and International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are
       further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
       statements section of our report.
       We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
       our opinion.
       Independence
       We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1
       International Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence
       Standards) (New Zealand) (PES 1) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards
       Board and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International
       Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA
       Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
       Our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of tax compliance and consulting, as well
       as tax pooling. The provision of these other services has not impaired our independence as auditor of
       the Group.

       Key audit matters
       Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in
       our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in
       the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
       opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

SEEKA LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2020                                                                                     71
     Our audit approach
     Overview
                                 Overall group materiality: $2,500,000, which represents approximately
                                 1% of revenue.
                                 We chose revenue as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the
                                 benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most
                                 commonly measured by users. The Group operates in a high-volume low
                                 margin industry where net profit is not representative of the scale of the
                                 Group.
                                 Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement, we:
                                 • Selected two entities for full scope audits
                                 • Performed specified audit procedures and analytical review procedures
                                 on the remaining entities.
                                 As reported above, we have four key audit matters, being:
                                     ●   Valuation of Biological Assets - crop
                                     ●   Valuation of Land and Buildings
                                     ●   Sale and leaseback of Australian orchards
                                     ●   Goodwill impairment

     As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material
     misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we considered where
     management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates
     that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in
     all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including
     among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of
     material misstatement due to fraud.
     Materiality
     The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain
     reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
     misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if,
     individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
     users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.
     Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
     including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out
     above. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit,
     the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both
     individually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
     How we tailored our group audit scope
     We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an
     opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the
     Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
     The materiality levels applied in the full scope audits of the New Zealand and Australian businesses
     were calculated by reference to a portion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the
     business concerned, or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes where the
     statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation.

   Other information
   The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
   included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our
   auditor's report thereon.
   Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
   express any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon.
   In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
   other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
   the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be
   materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained
   prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
   information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

   Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial statements
   The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of the
   consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal control as
   the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that
   are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
   In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
   ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
   using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to
   cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

   Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
   statements
   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements, as
   a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
   report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
   that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always detect a material
   misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
   individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
   users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
   A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As at 31 December 2020
At Seeka, we conduct our business safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best outcomes for our
growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.

Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the recommendations in the NZX Corporate
Governance Code 2020 (the Code) as set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews Seeka's corporate governance
structures against the eight principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures substantially meet Code
recommendations. Any exceptions are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 83 of this annual report.

Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/co.nz/corporate-governance.

The Board approved this governance statement on 26 February 2021.



Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
followed throughout the organisation.”

Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.

Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”

Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are promoted
to staff each year including at staff meetings. The code outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and
model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”

The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:

  • Conflicts of interest

  • Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property

  • Conduct, valuing individuals' differences and respecting all stakeholders

  • Dealing with gifts or gratuities

  • Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing

  • Compliance with laws and Seeka policies

  • Managing breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics

Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy prohibiting the direct or indirect dealing in Seeka financial products when holding inside information, plus
a duty of confidentiality that protects the dissemination and use of confidential company information.

The Insider Trading Policy defines black-out periods during which restricted persons are prohibited from trading in Seeka shares unless provided with
a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to and finishes the first trading day after key events; being the half-year
and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares. Restricted persons includes all
directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts and companies controlled by such
persons, and advisors.

Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chair of the Board, and the chair must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.

No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.



Principle 2. Board composition and performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”

Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interest of the company, to deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.

Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;

  • Amiel Diaz, representative of Seeka’s shareholder Sumifru Singapore Pte Limited, and former shareholder Farmind Corporation of Japan, and

  • Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chairman of the Ngai Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit
    grower supplying Seeka.

As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors have extensive
experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their extensive interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are considered non-
independent directors;

  • Martyn Brick

  • John Burke, and

  • Ratahi Cross

The Board has three independent directors;

  • Fred Hutchings, Board chair and remuneration committee chair

  • Ashley Waugh, audit and risk committee chair, and

  • Cecilia Tarrant, sustainability committee chair


Director appointments and induction
As required, the chairman establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.

Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the Group’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
Board.

The chair undertakes an annual assessment of Board, director and committee performance, seeking assistance, as required, from the nominations
committee and external advisors.

While there is no maximum term, the Board annually reviews director length of service and any potential impact on director independence. When the
Board recommends the re-election of a director whom has served longer than 12 years, they will explain to shareholders their rationale for supporting
re-election. All current directors have served terms shorter than 12 years.


Director profiles
Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 84 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 86 of this annual report.


Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.

The Board works to optimise diversity across director members, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity
in culture and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key
clients, creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns. Notably Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is a lecturer
in Māori history, Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia, and Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural
backgrounds.

Evaluation of board, committee and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chairman undertakes an annual review of Board, committee and director performance. The chairman's 2020
review found that the Board, committees and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified
by the Board Charter.



Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”

The Board has established three permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.

All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the sustainability, remuneration and nominations committee charters biennially and the audit and risk committee charter annually.


Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board with three independent directors. To provide effective and transparent committee
governance, while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent
director, with committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill set. The audit and risk
committee charter specifies a majority of independent directors.

The current standing committees are:

In the event of a takeover offer, the Board Charter provides for the formation of an ad-hoc initial response committee and an independent takeover
response committee to enact the procedures and protocols of the Board's Takeover Response Manual.

To date there has been no need to convene an initial response committee meeting or form an independent takeover response committee.

While the Board considers the current range of committees comprehensively manages the governance of Seeka’s business, and provides the best
outcomes for shareholders and other stakeholders, the Board Charter allows ad-hoc committees to be formed as required to aid Board decision
making.

Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”

Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a mid-
year performance update, along with regular operational updates to supplying clients.

Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chair of the Board, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for
identifying material information between Board meetings, with continuous disclosure covered at every Board meeting.

As stewards of more than 300 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and international
guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P standard for good
agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food. See www.globalgap.org.

Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.

In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit returns;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.

Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower

Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. Seeka also considers environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any environmental factors that may
materially affect operations.

In August 2020, Seeka formed a sustainability committee to provide strategic guidance on Seeka's sustainability framework, targets, measures and
performance. Seeka is working to measure then incrementally improve our environmental performance and the associated governance processes. We
know our orcharding and supply chain operations influence our environment, and we are actively addressing the risks and opportunities of climate
change. The sustainability committee provides guidance to the Seeka Agile Sustainability Team (SAST), which was formed In 2019 to develop Seeka’s
environmental and social policy and processes, and to deliver incremental improvements to the business. Drawing together staff who are passionate
about sustainability from all areas of our operations, and working with external advisors, Seeka's sustainability team is working to integrate
sustainability into the hearts and souls of our employees and deliver projects that reduce Seeka’s environmental footprint. Seeka's second annual
Sustainability report is included in this document.


Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”


Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chair uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration within
a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in April
2018, when the pool limit was set at $450,000 per annum, with the Board withdrawing a resolution to increase the pool in 2020, in response to the
Covid-19 pandemic.

Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according to expected time commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board.
Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and receive no performance or retirement benefits. Directors are not required to own Seeka shares.

The following table reports the allocation of the pool at the date of this report, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. No other benefits
were provided to directors during the year.

Chief executive officer remuneration
The review of the chief executive’s remuneration is undertaken by the remunerations committee with the remuneration package the responsibility of
the Board.

Michael Franks was appointed chief executive in 2006. His remuneration package comprises a fixed annual remuneration that covers base salary,
vehicle, Kiwisaver contributions, medical and life insurance, and an at-risk annual performance incentive.

The following table reports chief executive remuneration in 2020.

Performance incentive

The chief executive officer’s performance incentive has a maximum value of 72% of fixed remuneration for achieving annual targets set by the Board,
including financial performance, strategic goals, health and safety, and risk management. For the 2019 financial year, chief executive officer Michael
Franks earned an $114,064 performance incentive. This payment was made in 2020.

For the 2020 financial year, the chief executive officer earned a $388,988 performance incentive. This payment will be made in 2021 .

Employee share scheme

At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated April 2019 at $4.76 per share under the 2019 employee share scheme. These shares
vest 2022.



Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”

The Board considers risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific
focus on material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.

While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
Principles and Guidelines.

Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
performance against budget and forecasts.

The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian produce handling
and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia (when practicable with regard to Covid-19 travel restrictions)
to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating environments when assessing material risk.

The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated with
being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing revenue
from more points along the value chain. Since the incursion of the kiwifruit vine-killing disease Psa in 2010, Seeka has transformed from being a New
Zealand kiwifruit handler to become an Australasian produce business involved in the growing, handling, supply and marketing of multiple products.

Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post harvest processing and fruit handling facilities, along with
insurance cover for hail damage to crops.

The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB; Halyomorpha halys) remains one of the top pests of concern for New Zealand's horticultural industry. A
native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and accidentally introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s, adult BMSB feed on fruit and make them
unmarketable. The Ministry of Primary Industries is working with industry groups along with the public to prevent the unintended import of BMSB,
including eradication protocols if BMSB are detected in New Zealand. Seeka personnel and supplying growers are informed on how to identify BMSB
and the immediate actions to be undertaken if the pest is found.

Communicable diseases are a risk to labour availability, food safety and market access. Seeka works with industry bodies, the Government,
community agencies and international groups to secure reliable labour. Risk to food safety and market access is managed through Seeka's full
orchard-to-market track and trace service, which includes a register of all orchard visits and finger-scanner access to post harvest facilities. Tracing
from point of origin to point of sale allows Seeka to manage risk from contagion and ensures our markets can have confidence in the safety of our
supply chain and our products. Seeka's response to the communicable disease Covid-19 is detailed in the following health and safety section.


Health and safety
The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.

In 2020 Seeka confronted a new challenge to our health and safety systems, as Covid-19 threatened community health and disrupted business
systems.

Prior to Covid-19’s detection in New Zealand, Seeka formed a Covid-19 response committee to protect our people and prepare our business. We
worked with health professionals to secure personal protective equipment and implement social distancing protocols to mitigate risk. We secured
more-spacious accommodation for RSE workers and organised quarantine housing, which was later used to isolate suspected contacts of a confirmed
community case.

During harvest, Seeka initiated new protective measures to keep our people safe as we worked to deliver an essential service. This included
designating operational “bubbles”, onsite personnel temperature logging, provision of personal protective equipment, two-metre screening, enlarged
break areas, 24-hour cleaning and remote management. We were part of a community effort that kept our whānau safe as collectively we worked
to clear our growers' crops and supply the world with safe, healthy food. Over the Level-4 lockdown period, Seeka paid $12.2m in direct salary and
wages, along with a further $3.0m to picking contractors, and had no recorded cases of Covid-19 in our workforce.

Over the full year, the Group employed more than 3,000 people working in multiple complex environments. Group salary and wages equate to 1,680
full time equivalents.

1. Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) is a key measure that compares total lost time injuries and medical treatments against the total number of hours worked.
   TRIFR = (number of recordable lost time and medical treatment injuries) x 200,000 / (number of employee hours worked).

2. Severity rate = (number of lost time injuries) / (number of days lost).



Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”

Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the markets
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.

The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external audit
process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk committee:

  • Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and

  • Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.

For financial year 2020, Pip Cameron of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for Seeka Limited. Pip Cameron will complete her
five-year term as Seeka’s Auditor at the end of the 2020 financial year and Troy Florence of PwC will be the Auditor for FY21. The last audit partner
rotation was in FY16.

PwC has confirmed its independence to the audit and risk committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the reporting period.
PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.

During the year, PwC was paid $340,000 for audit fees and expenses, and $111,000 for tax compliance, pooling and consultancy work.


Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
external audit findings.

Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated financial audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s financial systems.
Directors also pay attention to matters raised by PwC, the external auditor.



Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”

Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering excellence to all stakeholders.

The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:

  • Annual and interim reports

  • Market announcements

  • Annual shareholder meeting

  • Mid-year stakeholder meeting

  • Ad-hoc investor presentations

  • Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type

  • Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors

  • Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update, either in person or when
practicable via the virtual online portal, where they can raise matters for discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major
decisions which affect Seeka at the annual shareholder meeting. Voting is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and
overseen by the company’s auditor PwC, on a one share, one vote principle.

Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar
Link Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. Notices of shareholder meetings are posted on the NZX website and Seeka's website. Where
circumstances allow, Seeka sends notices of shareholder meetings at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements
can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-announcements.

When raising new capital, when practical the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company so they can
maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.

Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK

 2. Board        2.8 A majority of the board        The Board Charter specifies a minimum of two independent directors.                 At all relevant
 Composition         should be independent                                                                                              times
 and                 directors.                     As Seeka's foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers it appropriate
 Performance                                        to have a mix of directors with extensive experience in kiwifruit production and
                                                    handling, who in the normal course of business would supply Seeka with produce
                                                    from their ongoing orcharding interests. The Board must also appropriately
                                                    represent large shareholders.

                                                    The specified minimum of two independent directors provides the flexibility
                                                    to meet these two criteria, while also ensuring Board decisions reflect the best
                                                    interests of Seeka and its security holders.

                                                    Currently, four directors are deemed non-independent; two for their extensive
                                                    interests in orchards that supply Seeka (industry expertise), one an appointee of
                                                    a large shareholder (market expertise), and one that has extensive interests in
                                                    orchards that supply Seeka as well as being an appointee of a large shareholder
                                                    (industry expertise).

                                                    Three of the seven directors (a minority) are independent.

 3. Board        3.3   Remuneration committee       To manage workload across the Board, the charter only specifies an independent      At all relevant
 Committees            should have a majority of    chair. The current remuneration committee does comply with the code by having       times
                       independent directors.       an independent chair, an independent director and a non-independent director.

                 3.4 Standing nominations           Nominations Committee Charter allows for the formation of an ad-hoc                 At all relevant
                     committee with a               committee as required. To manage workload across the Board, the charter only        times

was reviewed and would not have significantly changed the employee remuneration disclosure.
