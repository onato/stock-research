FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

Seeka is pleased to provide you with our annual report covering our performance, strategic progress and audited financial results
for the year ended 31 December 2019. The company has made excellent progress on its strategic growth pathway, including
consolidating business units and reducing debt through orchard sales, while continuing to deliver excellent results to our grower
clients.

The Group's financial performance was impacted by early 2019’s long dry summer which lowered Hayward kiwifruit yields
in both Australia and New Zealand. Hayward volumes were well down on forecast and prior year yields, and negatively
impacted our financial results. Offsetting this, Seeka expanded our core business with the purchase of Aongatete, delivered
cost efficiencies, made good gains on the sale of Northland orchard assets, and delivered significant improvements in our retail
services business. Operationally, the performance and returns to supplying growers were excellent.

Seeka continues to realise orchard assets held for sale to reduce debt. In some cases, the orchard sales are still awaiting
subdivision or boundary adjustments, and once completed both the sale and gain will be recorded in 2020.

Year end total net bank debt of $116.8m compares to $79.1m at year end 2018, and $148.1m at 30 June 2019. The successful
sale of orchard assets currently being marketed will further reduce net bank debt by at least $27.1m, with $10.1m of properties
conditionally sold at year end which were settled in February 2020.

Seeka continued to invest in core infrastructure with the build of onshore New Zealand post harvest capacity. The Oakside
$21.4m pack house and cool store project was completed in 2019 (the cool store build finished after the kiwifruit harvest) and a
modern pack house and cool store complex is under construction in Kerikeri, with phase two underway. The company expects
lower post harvest capital expenditure through 2020 and 2021.

The Group is focused on consolidating operations following the acquisition of the Northland and Aongatete assets, including
selling orchard assets to repay debt while securing supply to our core kiwifruit business. We are also investigating the sell down
and lease back of the Group’s Australian kiwifruit orchards which would release funds for debt reduction and potential expansion,
as we continue to look for investment opportunities by acquisition to deliver continuing accretive growth and shareholder value.

Seeka has fully adopted NZ IFRS 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16 - the new NZ accounting standard for leasing arrangements), and these
2019 financial results and 2018 comparatives are consistent with the new standard. The transition to NZ IFRS 16 negatively
impacts Seeka's financial results as the accounting for lease interest costs and depreciation are higher than the lease payment
at the beginning of the lease period. Further the full gain on orchard sales is no longer recognised in the statement of financial
performance when the property is leased back to Seeka.

–   $21.4m refurbishment of Oakside machine 2, additional pre-cooling and coolstores lift site capacity by 2.25m trays
    , improves site efficiency, and provides our growers with optimal harvest timing to ensure their fruit arrives in peak
    condition, while reducing their on-orchard risk.

Dividend announcement
A dividend of $0.12 per share has been declared by the Board. The dividend comprises a normal dividend of $0.08 per share
(following Board policy on a pre NZ IFRS 16 basis) and a special dividend of $0.04 cents per share following the completion of
property sales negotiated in 2019 and completed in 2020.

The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 17 April 2020 to those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 20 March 2020.
The dividend reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price. This dividend will bring the total dividends
distributed in the last 12 months to $0.24 (prior twelve months $0.24).

Outlook
Seeka is anticipating improved earnings in 2020 conditional on New Zealand and Australian crop volumes. The company has
an increasing volume of Zespri SunGold with both new growers and new developments, along with a significantly improved
SeekaFresh business and increasing avocado volumes. The company continues to consolidate the acquired businesses and
complete Northland orchard sales, and is investigating the potential sale and lease back of the Group’s Australian kiwifruit
orchards. Seeka is anticipating earnings growth, noting market uncertainty from the current coronavirus outbreak.

The company will provide current year earnings guidance at half year (once harvest is completed) and will update shareholders
on key events as and when they occur.

Operating asset growth through investments and acquisitions
Our core kiwifruit industry is going through a rapid growth phase, driven by the global demand for SunGold kiwifruit. Seeka's
strategic growth plan includes investing in orcharding services so landowners can produce high-value crops, and post harvest
capacity to manage ongoing volume growth. We have also extended our geographical reach with the 2018 Northland acquisition
and subsequent site build, and the 2019 acquisition of Aongatete in our kiwifruit heartland. These investments have secured new
capacity and are delivering a world-class service to our new client growers. Our investments in post harvest capacity are forecast
to handle the growth in crop volumes through to 2021.

Review of operations
Financial performance
Revenue for the twelve months ended 31 December increased 16% to $236.9m (2018: $203.7m). Consolidated earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $34.5m (2018: $33.3m); up 4%. This includes an $0.63m EBITDA loss
from Seeka Australia (2018: $0.06m loss), as a very dry summer lowered Hayward kiwifruit volumes, plus an underperforming
nashi programme.

Consolidated profit after tax totalled to $6.88m (2018: $6.65m), with cash flow from operations up 14% to $18.59m (2018:
$16.35m).

In 2019 Seeka invested $34.67m in property plant and equipment, primarily building the Kerikeri pack house and commissioning
a new packing machine and upgrading Oakside packing machine 2, pre-coolers and cool stores. Once additional pre-cooler and
cool store builds at Kerikeri are completed, Seeka’s post harvest capacity is forecast to be able to handle fruit supply for the next
two seasons. Our focus is on improving supply chain efficiency and seeking innovative solutions to curtail further investments.

During the year, Seeka realised $44.53m in assets held for sale of which $34.55m related to its Northland orchards. These
Northland sales delivered $3.19m in gains along with a secure supply commitment. In addition, at year end Seeka had
conditionally sold a further $10.1m in Northland properties; these sales settled on 24 February 2020.

At balance date, Seeka held $27.08m of assets for sale, including its Australian kiwifruit orchards which are currently being
considered for sale and lease back.

The combination of conditional sales, assets held for sale, or sold assets awaiting settlement totals $42.6m.

Net debt at 31 December (bank loans less bank deposits) was $116.79m compared to $79.01m at year end 2018 and $148.08m
at 30 June 2019.

New Zealand orchard operations
Seeka’s New Zealand orchard operations span from Northland through to the Coromandel, Bay of Plenty and East Coast, providing a
comprehenseive service to owners of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry orchards, including managing their orchards, vine management,
orchard leasing and long-term land leases where Seeka develops and operates the orchards.

Orcharding kiwifruit volumes increased from new production associated with the Northland and Aongatete acquisitions, with
the company growing 41.11m kilograms of kiwifruit (11.42m trays) compared to the prior year’s 37.44m kilograms (10.68m trays).
The acquired orchards helped offset the drop in Hayward yields (9,800 trays per hectare compared to 11,800 trays per hectare in
2018), caused by the hot summer which restricted fruit size and increased reject rates. Hayward yields have now fluctuated over
the last three seasons.

Seeka also grew 732,000 kilograms of avocados (2018: 200,000 kgs) and 64,400 kilograms of kiwiberry (2018: 15,000 kgs).

In 2019 Seeka purchased Aongatete Coolstores Limited and has now fully integrated the orchard division.

Orchard operations revenue of $72.42m is up 37% on 2018's $52.83m, while EBITDA of $4.99m compares to $4.21m in 2018.
The moderate increase in EBITDA reflects the profit share mechanisms in favour of the orchard owners, alongside the primary
risk.

At year end orchard operations had $54.18m of assets and $34.78m of liabilities resulting in $19.39m in net assets (2018:
$25.82m).

Seeka continues to invest in long term lease arrangements with $2.33m invested in 2019, on top of $2.94m invested in 2018.
Income from these investments will flow from 2020 as the orchards enter production.

 New Zealand post harvest operations
 Post harvest operates eight major facilities spread throughout the major growing regions in the North Island handling all produce from our
 orcharding operations and from our independent growers, and packing other fruits including citrus on contract for third parties.

 In the period, 33.46m trays of kiwifruit were packed (2018: 31.41m), with 3.9m trays supplied by growers associated with our new
 Aongatete acquisition completed 18 March.

 Total post harvest volumes were impacted by the dry summer, with Hayward yields from Seeka’s traditional supplying growers
 down 17% on the prior period. Felt across the industry, this significant drop in Hayward production reduced product flow to
 Seeka’s post harvest operations, and tempered the positive impact Aongatete delivered to our core post harvest business.

 The company had the capacity, systems and personnel to deliver a timely harvest to our grower clients. Coolstore fruit loss, a key
 measure of performance for our growers, was extremely low across all varieties.

 Purchased immediately prior to harvest, Aongatete was integrated into the Seeka business and scale-related synergies will be
 delivered in 2020.

 Post harvest revenue of $140.11m compared to $123.81m in 2018. Driven by higher wages, inflation and the ongoing focus on
 health and safety, post harvest costs are up across our industry. EBITDA of $40.98m compares with $37.16m in 2018.

 New Zealand retail services operations
 Includes the supply and sale of avocados and class 2 New Zealand kiwifruit, sale of New Zealand kiwifruit through collaborative
 programmes, handling of imported tropical fruits, and the production, marketing and distribution of Kiwi Crush and avocado oil.

 EBITDA of $1.67m is down from 2018's $2.34m due to a reduced kiwiberry harvest (in line with lower Hayward yields), lower
 avocado volumes from biennial bearing, and higher supply chain costs. The retail services business has undergone a revitalisation
 with significant improvement in financial performance from late 2019. The growth in retail services is set to continue in 2020.

Australia operations
Seeka Australia PTY Limited, a 100% Seeka-owned entity, owns and operates kiwifruit, nashi and pear orchards along with associated
post harvest facilities in Victoria, and directly markets Seeka produce to retailers.

Kiwifruit yields were again down following a very hot and dry summer which impacted fruit size; kiwifruit remain profitable, albeit
at lower levels. The green nashi sales programme delivered a loss. Volumes and planted areas have been reset to match the crop
to profitable market opportunities.

Seeka is positive about its Australian investment and its Australian orchard portfolio, and is confident that its proposed strategy
to sell and leaseback its kiwifruit orchards will realise a gain that will be used to repay debt. This process is continuing.

Seeka continues to test the production and marketing of new kiwifruit and licenced pear varieties on its Australian orchards, with
70 hectares of kiwifruit and 26 hectares of pears in development which will add to production from 2020 onwards.

The detection of Psa in Australia did not impact our mature Hayward kiwifruit orchards and the company continues to monitor
its development orchards. Seeka has licensed a Chinese Gold variety to grow on its new Australian kiwifruit development
orchards.

Across all varieties Seeka is concentrating on quality and increasing financial returns.

EBITDA loss of $0.63m (2018 : $0.06m loss) was due to lower yields and an under-performing green nashi programme.

Seeka’s Australian operations are an important investment in extending our geographical reach and product range and we will
continue to further develop the business, including upgrading existing and developing new orchards, and investing in water
to grow production. Yields per hectare and total volumes are expected to improve over the next three years as new plantings
mature.

2019 volumes by variety are outlined in the following table with 2018 comparatives:

Agile - preparing for challenges and seizing opportunities
Seeka has launched a series of project teams which have adopted the Agile approach. Drawing from expertise held across
our business, Seeka’s Agile teams are focusing on important issues to Seeka and its stakeholders. This includes Seeka's Agile
Sustainability team which is helping reshape our business to the structural challenges of climate change. We are on a journey
of innovation as we determine how to best deliver sustainable business practices within a fast-changing world, measure our
achievements, and hold ourselves accountable for our performance to all stakeholders. Seeka's first sustainability reporting is
included in this document.

The other areas of focus for Seeka's Agile teams include Safety, Innovation, Marketing, SeekaApp and Information Systems. This
is a trial process with teams working to identify their goals, achievable actions and reporting mechanisms. Seeka is finding its way
with Agile, and possibly not all projects will succeed, however excellent early progress is being made.

Strategic highlights
Seeka continues to enact our strategy. Kiwifruit is our core product, with the company diversifying geographically and targeting
complementary produce categories. The focus is on growth that delivers accretive value to our stakeholders; our shareholders,
growers, employees, contractors and community. Our focus is on delivering our marketers, principally Zespri, the highest-quality
fruit and delivering our growers great returns through our supply chain.

Seeka has excelled where it operates the entire value chain from the orchard to the customer and delivered incremental returns
to growers, as demonstrated with avocado and kiwiberry. Seeka delivers orchard-to-market excellence in New Zealand kiwifruit,
avocados, class 2 kiwifruit, and kiwiberry, along with Australian kiwifruit, nashi and European pears.

Seeka continues to consolidate its position, setting its management structures and selling orchards with secure supply contracts
to reset debt while pursuing operational excellence.

We have expanded our core business through the Aongatete acquisition, and secured Northland post harvest volumes while
negotiating $34.55m of orchard sales, with a further $10.10m settled in February 2020. Seeka has also invested in long-term
orchard relationships. Seeka continues to market its remaining Northland orchards.

Seeka is working through the process of potentially selling and leasing back 105 hectares of Australian kiwifruit orchards (on 199
hectares of land) to test if the same outcomes can be obtained in Australia. The planned sale and leaseback will help accelerate
growth in this key market while repaying Seeka debt.

Market conditions for Australian-grown produce are good and the fruit is of excellent quality, noting it is a completely different
growing environment. Kiwifruit production in Australia is set to double in the next five years.

The company has focused on asset utilisation and capacity planning and has substantially built the infrastructure to handle
volume growth over the next two seasons. It has deliberately positioned itself in Northland to provide excellent service to the
region’s growth in avocados and kiwifruit, and has actively increased its avocado market share, including directly purchasing and
syndicating Far North orchards. This has delivered a benefit to investors and new volumes and market share to Seeka.

Safety
Seeka’s focus is on continuous improvement to ensure the health and safety of all personnel at all locations. All reported
incidents and near misses are followed up within the company. There were three serious harm incidents in 2019, two hand
injuries (packing machine drop and Bunbartha pollen mill), and a very serious incident at Oakside when a forklift driver was
injured by the counterweights between two forklifts. The worker in this incident suffered significant injuries and while expected
to make a full recovery, has had an extended period off work. Full traffic management reviews have taken place with corrective
actions and extra barriers erected. Significant money has been invested in machine guarding, traffic barriers and traffic planning
to further ensure the safety of our people, particularly near fixed plant with moving components, and from moving plant and
vehicles.

At 5.0 the total recordable injury frequency rate is above the annual 4.5 threshold and ahead of the 2018 rate of 4.5. The
company continues to monitor, manage and take all reasonable steps to prevent workplace injuries.

The following table shows key safety measures against annual thresholds. :
                                                                                                                    2019 Target            2019 Actuals

The total recordable injury frequent rate (TRIFR) measures the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked. In total Seeka worked a total of 2.70m hours in 2019, with
the number of operating hours varying with the total volumes Seeka packs and handles across all varieties and sites. Seasonal pressures can be challenging along with
harvest deadlines. Seeka TRIFR was 5.0 for 2019.

Severity rate measures the average number of days that an injured person is away from work. Seeka had 3 notifiable injuries including incidents in 2019.

The Seeka team
Seeka’s people have excelled during the year. The company has purchased and integrated Aongatete. It has fully transitioned
to NZ IFRS 16 Leases which given the number and extent of Seeka’s leasing interests, is a significant feat. Operational staff have
delivered excellence in harvest and fruit handling for our grower clients, helping them achieve excellent returns along with the
delivery of outstanding fruit quality to the principal marketer Zespri. The SeekaFresh business has turned its financial performance
around, albeit late in the year. And the Australian business has worked hard in trying conditions supported by Seeka’s commercial
team. Both avocado and kiwiberry growers have benefited from dedicated and focused efforts of the Seeka team.

Seeka continues to invest in its people to become the employer of choice in a tight labour market. The company has reset
minimum wages to new thresholds, and comprehensively reviewed all remuneration levels to ensure Seeka people are well
remunerated. Seeka continues to promote diversity across our organisation, and respect the rights of all employees and
stakeholders. Our remuneration policy promotes pay equity based on performance, and we offer a range of employee-focused
benefits, including health insurance, a wellness programme that supports healthy choices, and a biennial share scheme that
rewards loyalty. We continue to focus on talent development including 12 cadets, with some now emerging as qualified orchard
managers.

Seeka continues to actively source New Zealand workers to fulfil peak seasonal labour demand and operates a parallel
recognised seasonal employer programme (RSE) that delivers focused pastoral care to our overseas workers. Of our 3,000
strong seasonal workforce, Seeka recruited 970 overseas workers through the RSE scheme.

Seasonal labour continues to be a challenge, with the industry increasingly relying on overseas labour to complement the
available local workforce. Backpacker labour was in short supply, adding to employment pressure. This employment environment
pushed the industry to the limit. These circumstances increase the risk profile. Seeka continues to work on initiatives to attract
skilled people and keep them safe.

The company has gone to significant lengths to ensure contractors and subcontractors comply with labour, health and safety
legislation, and strive to achieve best practice. Seeka has a dedicated team that coaches, audits and undertakes gap analysis with
our contractor and subcontractor community to ensure we achieve better than just compliant.

Summary
Seeka continues to consolidate its operations while focusing on delivering performance to our growers. The company has
made excellent progress selling the Northland orchards, reducing debt and securing supply from this region, while developing a
world-class post harvest facility in Kerikeri. Seeka is now pursuing a similar sale and potential leaseback strategy for orchards in
Australia.

Hayward kiwifruit yields were down on last season, and this impacted our profit in 2019. Despite a number of challenges, the
company is benefiting from substantial cash gains realised by the ongoing sales of our Northland orchard portfolio, which along
with the acquisition of Aongatete to our core business has resulted in a pleasing result for the financial year

Seeka expects increased earnings in 2020 following this year of consolidation.

We thank all growers, shareholders and stakeholders for the loyalty and support you willingly give to Seeka.

Turnover
The Board considers turnover a useful measure of the Group's operating activity as it represents the total transactional value of goods and
services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following table details the offset amounts.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future
taxable profits is probable. No amounts were recognised at balance date and there were no unrecognised tax losses (Dec 2018 - Nil).
The deferred tax liability recognised in the financial statements does not represent the tax that would be payable on the disposal of the buildings;

At 31 December 2019, 56 hectares of Northland orchards (Dec 2018 - 140 hectares) owned by Seeka were classified as held for sale. These
properties were purchased as part of the 2018 purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited and business combination detailed in note 19b.
At 31 December 2019, 26 hectares had conditional sale agreements subject to subdivision. These sales went unconditional on 17 February 2020,
see note 8.
The assets are classified as held for sale as their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition was met when the sale became highly probable and the assets were available for immediate sale in their present
condition. The Group is committed to the sale and expects the sale to be completed within one year from the date of classification. These assets
are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell as required by NZ IFRS 5, based on independent valuations of the
properties at year end as detailed in note 10.
Assets related to the sale of three orchards in Australia (Hayward, Austral and Lakes) are also recognised as assets held for sale from 1 September
2019. The sale will be subject to a leaseback arrangement. The Group expects that substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the
assets will transfer to a buyer.
As described in note 11, all of the goodwill from the Australia CGU has been allocated to the disposal group, based on the Group's assessment of
relative fair values of the assets held for sale and Australia assets being retained.
The Group used a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate relative fair values. Key assumptions used include yields per hectare, based on
historic actual yields adjusted for the expected effects of orchard development such as regrafting, and market returns, based on normalised
historic returns which are considered a reasonable best estimate of future returns.
A discount rate of 9% and terminal growth rate of 2% were applied. No reasonably possible adjustments in these assumptions would result in a
materially different allocation of goodwill.



    Critical accounting estimates and judgements
    The Group has used estimates to judgementally allocate goodwill to the Australian assets held for sale, as described above.

Impairment of bearer plants
For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group replaced some Australian bearer plants as a result of the Psa disease being identified on
new grafts. This resulted in an impairment and the write off of the carrying value of bearer plants of $0.40m (Dec 2018 - $0.30m) which was
recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Crop where cost is deemed fair value
Kiwifruit, nashi, Packham and Corella pear crops are not considered to have achieved sufficient biological transformation at balance date and as
such cost is deemed fair value, see note 29.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, $0.50m of development costs were expensed due to the effect of Psa on recently grafted crops on
producing orchards in Australia (Dec 2019: Nil). This was reflected in the change in the fair value of the biological asset.




Accounting policies
Biological assets are the crops growing on bearer plants in the Group’s leased and owned orchards. The method to determine fair value depends
on the degree of biological transformation (the maturity of the fruit) at balance date.
When insufficient biological transformation has occurred, the fair value is the costs incurred at balance date to grow the crops (provided the costs
are considered recoverable). When costs are not considered recoverable they are expensed in the statement of financial performance.
When sufficient biological transformation has occurred, fair value is the estimated net market return less selling cost and costs to market.
The estimated market return less selling cost is established by reference to current and expected sales returns when available. When market data
is not available an assessment is made based on historical data.




     Critical accounting estimates and judgements
     The valuation of biological assets uses estimates of market returns to determine value.

13. Leases
As a result of the adoption of NZ IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019, the Group is required to report all leases on the balance sheet, with the exception of
low value leases or leases less than 12 months. The Group has elected to adopt the standard fully retrospectively, which means prior year numbers

Impact of adoption of NZ IFRS 16
The Group has adopted NZ IFRS 16 fully retrospectively. All numbers in the financial statements have been restated to reflect the standard as if
it has always applied. The leases the Group recognises under NZ IFRS 16 were previously recognised as operating leases under NZ IAS 17 and
were previously disclosed as a commitment in the notes to the financial statements. These operating leases are now restated as right-of-use lease
assets and lease liabilities. The Group also restated one intangible asset, being the lease interest in land, which is now incorporated into the right-
of-use lease asset, so has been removed from the opening balance on restatement. The opening adjustment to recognise the right-of-use lease
asset and lease liability has been recognised in retained earnings, net of the deferred tax impact.
The following table details the impact of the adoption of NZ IFRS 16 on the statement of financial position.

current trade receivables are considered recoverable and relate to debtors secured against crop supply commitments with repayment terms of up
to five years.
The purchase of Aongatete Coolstores Limited has increased debtors and accrued income by a combined $0.78m (Dec 2018 - Nil).
A $0.13m provision for doubtful debts was recognised in the accounts (Dec 2018 - $0.51m).



Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful debts.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis including debts past due, but not considered impaired. Debts which are known
to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected default rates over the balance of trade
receivables. See note 28 for calculation details.

All of the Group’s term loans are on interest-only repayment terms, with the exception of the $6.4m Rabobank loan, which requires a $0.5m
annual payment of principal.
Assets pledged as security
Bank loans and overdrafts are secured by first mortgages over the Group’s freehold land and buildings. The Group’s policy is to protect the term
portion of the loans from exposure to changing interest rates via the use of derivatives, see note 30.

Accounting policies
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
When it is probable that part or the entire loan will be drawn down, any loan facility establishment fee paid is recognised as a loan transaction cost.
When the loan will probably remain undrawn, any loan fee paid is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
the facility.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
balance date.

Grower loyalty share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible growers of kiwifruit, avocado and kiwiberry to participate in a three-year grower loyalty share
scheme, whereby each participant would be allocated a parcel of shares based on their orchard's current or forecast production. This issue of up
to 2.6m shares was approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
In April 2019, 2,061,803 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf of 405 participating growers. The issue price of $4.76 per share
was funded by the Group making a $9.8m non-interest-bearing loan to the trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by supplying all
product from the participating orchards for three consecutive seasons, participating growers can elect to pay the outstanding balance of their
loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.
Employee share scheme
On 15 March 2019, the Group invited eligible employees to participate in a five-year employee share scheme, whereby each participant would
be allocated a parcel of shares based on their role in the business. In April 2019, 568,000 shares were issued to the scheme's trustees on behalf
of 319 participating employees. The issue price of $4.76 per share was funded by the Group making a $2.7m non-interest-bearing loan to the
trustees. Upon meeting the terms of the scheme by continuing employment for three consecutive years, participating employees can elect to pay
the outstanding balance of their loans, less any dividend payments made on the shares, and have the shares transferred to them.



Accounting policies
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.

The goodwill was allocated to the post harvest and orchard segments and is attributable to the operation’s strong position in the Bay of Plenty and
synergies expected to arise after adding additional post harvest and orchard facilities to Seeka’s operations. The goodwill is not expected to be impaired
in the foreseeable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of $0.20m were included in
administrative expenses. Deferred tax of $2.9m was provided in relation to differences between tax values and the fair value of certain assets.
Land and buildings were valued using an independent valuation completed by Telfer Young Valuers using the same approach as other land and
buildings detailed in note 10.

b. Purchase of Kerikeri assets from T&G Global Limited
During the period ended 31 December 2018, the Group purchased Kerikeri-based kiwifruit orchards, packhouse facilities and related assets and
liabilities representing the kiwifruit business previously owned by T&G Global Limited. The transaction was completed in two stages. The first
stage was the purchase of the packhouse facilities and related assets on 30 April 2018. The second stage was the purchase of the orchards from
30 June 2018. One orchard remained subject to subdivision at 31 December 2018 and was settled in June 2019. This orchard remained at the risk
of T&G Global Limited until the relevant individual titles were issued.

The goodwill was allocated to the post harvest and orchard segments and is attributable to the post harvest operation's strong position and
profitability in the Northland market and synergies expected to arise from adding the packhouse to Seeka's operations. The goodwill is not
expected to be impaired in the foreseeable future. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of
$0.41m were included in administrative expenses.
Seeka purchased the Northland orchards with the intention to market them for sale with supply commitments for fruit packing to Seeka. Seeka is
focussed on refurbishing and operating the post harvest facility as part of its post harvest business operations. See note 9 for details.

The calculations for 2018 earnings and net tangible assets per share were adjusted for the November 2018 rights issue. As a result of the capital
raise, a bonus element is applied to the calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax
effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed
to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Net tangible asset per share
Net tangible asset per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s net assets less goodwill by the total shares on issue at the end of the period.

Share reserve
The Group operates two equity-settled, share-based incentive plans:
– An equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for employees. Shares are periodically issued under this plan.
– An equity-settled, grower loyalty share scheme approved by shareholders on 14 February 2019.
The employee share scheme is managed by a trust deed established September 2014. The grower loyalty share scheme is managed by a trust deed
established 15 March 2019. The trustee for both trusts is 'Seeka Share Trustee Limited', whose directors are also directors of Seeka.
Employee share scheme
Under the employee share scheme, shares are issued to an employee share trust in return for a debt back to the Company. Qualifying employees
are eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the scheme with the shares to vest at the end of three years. The option
benefit is recognised as a share-based payment expense and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the
employee has an option to settle any outstanding debt on their shares and have the shares transferred to them.
At the date the shares vest the employee can elect to extend the repayment period by two years with interest charged and the shares held by the
trust as security and only transferred when the debt is fully repaid. Alternatively at the date the shares vest the employee can elect that the shares
do not vest to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustees. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from
the sale of shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.

Grower loyalty share scheme
Under the grower loyalty share schemes shares are issued to a share trust in return for a debt owned back to the Company. Qualifying supplying
growers were eligible to subscribe to shares held by the trust under the terms of the offer agreements dated 15 March 2019 and 22 March 2019.
Shares vest after the grower supplies the Company their kiwifruit and avocado crops for the three harvests through to 31 March 2022. The option
benefit is recognised as a discount against revenue over the vesting period. At the end of the vesting period the grower has an option to settle any
outstanding debt on the shares and have the shares transferred to them. Alternatively the grower can elect not to have the shares transferred
to them and any outstanding debt will be forgiven and the shares sold by the trustee. The proceeds from the shares that vest or from the sale of
shares is used to repay the debt owed to the Company.

For both schemes the shares are issued fully paid in exchange for a loan to the share scheme trust of behalf of scheme members.
The shares held by the trustee on behalf of employees and growers carry the same voting rights as other issued ordinary shares with votes only
able to be made via the trustees. The trustees are not able to vote, other than at the direction of the individual member employees and growers.
While monies are owed on the shares they remain with the trustee.
The options element of the schemes are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model on the grant date, which is the date the shares are first
issued to the trust. Volatility is forecasted into the model.

The dividends are imputed to the fullest extent allowable in the tax year. The total dividend paid includes the non-cash amounts for the dividend
reinvestment plan. Cash dividend payment was $6.31m (Dec 2018: $3.64m).
On 25 February 2020, the directors declared a fully-imputed dividend of $0.12 per share. The dividend comprises a normal dividend of $0.08 per
share (following Board policy on a pre NZ IFRS 16 basis) and a special dividend of $0.04 cents per share following the completion of property
sales negotiated in 2019 and completed in 2020.
The dividend is fully imputed and will be paid on 17 April 2020 to those shareholders on the register at 5pm on 20 March 2020. The dividend
reinvestment plan will apply with a 2% discount to the strike price. This dividend will bring the total dividends distributed in the last 12 months to $0.24
(prior twelve months $0.24).



Accounting policies
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the period but not distributed at balance date.

Zespri share sale
In September 2018 the Group sold all shares held in Zespri. The shares were valued at $5.8m at the time of sale, with a gain of $0.27m being
recognised in other comprehensive income during the year. When the Group adopted NZ IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018, the investment in Zespri
shares was designated as fair value through other comprehensive income.




Accounting policies
The fair values of the listed securities are based on the securities' closing share price at balance date. Where pricing information is available,
unlisted securities are revalued at balance date. All other unlisted securities are currently held at cost less impairment as it reasonably represents
current fair value. The carrying amount of all unlisted securities have been reviewed at balance date and any impairment is recognised through the
statement of comprehensive income to the extent of any related reserve available and then through the statement of financial performance.

Accounting policies
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, typically by holding between 20% to 50% of the voting
rights in the entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method after initially being recognised at cost.
The Group's share of associates' profits or losses are recognised in the statement of financial performance and the carrying amount of the
investment in the statement of financial position.
Dividends received from associates are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the investment in the statement of financial position.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its expected cash flows, liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure
that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity
requirements in the short and longer term. Cash flow forecasting allows for the seasonal nature of Group operations.
When cash flow exceeds working capital management, funds are invested in interest bearing current accounts.
At balance date, the Group had $139.6m (Dec 2018 - $142.1m) of available credit of which $119.7m (Dec 2018 - $75.6m) was drawn. All credit
lines are currently provided by two finance providers.
The following table details the remaining contractual maturities at balance date of the Group’s financial liabilities.

d. Capital risk
Capital risk management focuses on ensuring the Group continues to operate as a going concern and maintains an optimal capital structure to
support its business, maximise shareholder value, and the benefits delivered to other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting dividends, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of shareholder equity ratio, as calculated by total shareholder funds divided by total assets.
The following table details the Group’s shareholder equity ratio at balance date.

                                                                                                                                  2019               2018

29. Determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
The different levels are defined as:
– Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
  Instruments in level 1 are comprised of equity holdings in Zespri Group Limited and water shares.
– Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
– Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that have to be developed to reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use
  when determining an appropriate price.


                                                                                          Level 1           Level 2            Level 3            Total

           To the shareholders of Seeka Limited

           in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ
           IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

     Our audit approach
     Overview

                               An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
                               consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
                               Overall Group materiality: $2,270,000, which represents approximately 1%
                               of revenue.
                               We chose revenue as the benchmark for our materiality as we consider this
                               is an appropriate measure of performance of the Group. The Group
                               operates in a high-volume low margin industry where net profit is not
                               representative of the scale of the Group.
                               We have determined that there are three key audit matters:
                                •   Valuation of Biological Assets - crop
                                •   Valuation of Land and Buildings
                                •   Australian assets classified as held for sale and allocation of goodwill

     Materiality
     The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
     Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,
     including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out
     above. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit,
     the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both
     individually and in aggregate on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
     Audit scope
     We designed our audit by assessing the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial
     statements and our application of materiality. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of
     management override of internal controls including among other matters, consideration of whether
     there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
     We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an
     opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the
     Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
     We audited the New Zealand, Australian and newly acquired Aongatete business of the Group at a
     materiality level calculated by reference to a portion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative
     scale of the business concerned or based on materiality calculated for statutory reporting purposes
     where the statutory materiality was lower than that allocated in the Group calculation.

     Key audit matters
     Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in
     our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in
     the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
     opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

     Information other than the consolidated financial statements and auditor’s report
     The Directors are responsible for the annual report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial
     statements does not cover the other information included in the annual report and we do not express
     any form of assurance conclusion on the other information.
     In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
     other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
     with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise
     appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information
     that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material
     misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report
     in this regard.

     Responsibilities of the Directors for the consolidated financial statements
     The Directors are responsible, on behalf of the Company, for the preparation and fair presentation of
     the consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ IFRS and IFRS, and for such internal
     control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
     statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
     In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the
     Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
     concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate
     the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

     Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
     Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
     statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
     issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
     but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always
     detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
     considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
     the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

SEEKA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
Seeka's core operation is growing, packing and supplying healthy produce to world markets. We are the guardians of more than
1000 hectares of producing orchards, and care for the produce and financial returns of more than 500 landowners. From orchard
development and management, to supply chain infrastructure and operations, we work with a wide range of stakeholders as we
collectively supply healthy produce.

As we work to generate wealth from prime horticultural land, our grower clients, staff, contractors, communities, consumer
clients and investors rely on Seeka to provide safe and sustainable business practices. This includes helping our stakeholders
certify supply operations to the international GLOBALG.A.P. standard for good agricultural practice. In line with the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), GLOBALG.A.P. demonstrates our commitment to care for the land, our people
and its produce, and Seeka has embraced the GLOBALG.A.P. GRASP module that focuses on worker health, safety and welfare.

As a land-based operation, Seeka knows how our environment influences orchard health and the volumes and the quality of the
fruit we handle each season, and we are using this information as we understand the impact of climate change. Seeka's inaugural
sustainability report documents our efforts to measure then incrementally improve our environmental and social performance,
and the associated governance processes.

Sustainability team and process
While Seeka's core business is kiwifruit, our operations extend along the full supply chain from vine to shelf. From bareland
development to the processing of consumer lines, we work to extract the best value from the land and its produce. Our products
include avocados, kiwiberry, nashi, pears, citrus and berries as we strive to offer a better service to our grower and consumer
clients, and make better use of our facilities, supply chain systems and workforce.

The extension of our supply chain system and expansion of products has created a multi-disciplined team. To capture this
expertise and apply it to our sustainability programme, we have implemented Seeka's Agile Sustainability Team (SAST). Drawing
together staff that are passionate about sustainability from all areas of our operations, SAST is working with external advisors
and taking guidance from regional and national experts to develop Seeka's environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy
and processes.

Our Agile approach and SAST team are using a stepped process to deliver incremental improvements.

1. Define what sustainability means for Seeka

2. Identify key inputs and outputs of Seeka's operations

3. Quantify inputs and outputs using available data

4. Identify and rank areas for environmental, social and governance improvements

5. Prioritise actions that deliver incremental improvements

6. Evaluate how Seeka's sustainability actions have impacted our ESG position

A key contributor to the success of our ESG programme is to engage and involve all staff and key stakeholders in our journey, and
to incorporate their insights and expertise. This includes publicising our progress and celebrating our wins.

     independent growers. Includes sustainable environmental management and the generational transformation of land into
     horticultural orchards.

–    Post harvest - the supply chain from the orchard to the point of sale, which handles all produce from Seeka orchards and from
     independent growers. Includes the long-term development of post harvest infrastructure.

–    Corporate - the provision of support services, including process government and management, IT and communications, stakeholder
     relations and value-added services including produce branding.

Key inputs and outputs
Inputs and their associated outputs have been grouped into five categories:

–    Labour - Seeka is a large user of labour with more than 3000 people directly employed each season, along with a large number
     of people working through contractors.

–    Consumables - includes on-orchard consumables such as fertilisers, sprays and ties, post harvest consumables such as
     packaging, labelling and H&S material, and corporate consumables such as mobile devices, vehicles and office supplies.

–    Fossil fuels - used to power on-orchard activities, supply chain movements and corporate activities.

–    Renewable energy - used to power post harvest and corporate operations; the main source of renewable energy is electricity
     generated from largely renewable sources and supplied via the national grid, along with Seeka's trial investment in solar
     generators at Seeka360 head office.

–    Water - Seeka uses water to grow crops, in the post harvest value chain, and to deliver corporate services.

Focus on waste reduction
SAST has identified waste minimisation as a key objective to deliver immediate gains to Seeka's operations and incrementally
improve the company's ESG position. This includes identifying and replicating best practice within our organisation, and diverting
waste product to recycling initiatives.

Step 3. Quantify inputs and outputs using available data
For each of the key inputs, SAST are currently developing a framework to guide ESG policy and actions. Each framework will include
a small number of achievable projects to be undertaken in 2020.

Next steps
In 2020, SAST will draw on the information collated in the input frameworks to progressively develop a formal ESG reporting
framework. The objective is to develop consistent reporting so stakeholders can understand how Seeka is adapting our business to
manage risk and take advantage of new opportunities in our every-changing operating environment. The three elements to Seeka's
reporting framework will be:

–    Environmental - how we steward the land and our natural resources

–    Social - how we manage relations with stakeholders, including employees, grower clients, our communities and our retail
     partners

–    Governance - how we govern our business, manage risk, realise opportunities and comply with relevant legislation and
     stakeholder expectations

To aid stakeholder engagement, Seeka will develop ESG reporting in line with one of the three global reporting frameworks
commonly used in New Zealand and Australia; Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Integrated Reporting, or UN Global Compact
(UNGC).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As at 31 December 2019
At Seeka, we conduct our business safely and ethically, within the legal and regulatory framework, so we can deliver the best outcomes for our
growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and the communities we operate in.

Seeka’s Board and management are committed to best practice governance and Seeka has adopted the NZX Corporate Governance Code 2020
(the Code) as set out in this corporate governance statement. The Board regularly reviews Seeka's corporate governance structures against the eight
principle recommendations in the Code, and considers Seeka's practices and procedures substantially meet Code recommendations. Any exceptions
are noted in this governance statement, and listed on page 78 of this annual report.

Seeka's governance policies are available on Seeka's website, see Seeka.co.nz/co.nz/corporate-governance.

The Board approved this governance statement on 26 February 2020.



Principle 1. Code of ethical behaviour
“Directors should set high standards of ethical behaviour, model this behaviour and hold management accountable for these standards being
followed throughout the organisation.”

Seeka commits to high ethical standards in all dealings undertaken by the Group’s directors, employees and suppliers. We are a produce business that
connects growers with customers. Our business spans cultural, regulatory and country boundaries, and our directors and management understand
that high ethical standards deliver the best outcomes for our growers, clients, employees, shareholders, customers and communities.

Our commitment to ethical dealings is captured by Seeka’s core brand attribute “founded on relationships.”

Seeka’s Code of Ethics is included in employee induction packs, is available on Seeka’s intranet, and the code's principles and objectives are promoted
to staff each year including at staff meetings. The code outlines how directors and management are to consistently act with honesty and integrity, and
model high ethical standards to all employees and stakeholders, adhering to the principle “we do what we say and are accountable for what we do.”

The Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on:

  • Conflicts of interest

  • Proper use of Seeka information, assets and property

  • Dealing with gifts or gratuities

  • Respecting all stakeholders

  • Whistle blowing for safe reporting of potential wrong doing

  • Compliance with laws and Seeka policies

  • Managing any breaches of Seeka’s Code of Ethics

Seeka also has a strict Insider Trading Policy prohibiting the direct or indirect dealing of Seeka securities when holding inside information, plus a duty
of confidentiality that protects the dissemination and use of confidential company information.

The Insider Trading Policy includes a black-out period during which restricted persons are prohibited in trading in Seeka shares unless provided with
a specific exemption by the Board. Each black-out period starts 30 days prior to and finishes the first trading day after key events; being the half-year
and full-year balance dates, and the release to the NZX of any announcement relating to an offer in Seeka shares. Restricted persons includes all
directors, executive officers, members of the management executive team and their administrative staff, any trusts and companies controlled by such
persons, and advisors.

Prior to trading in Seeka shares, directors must notify the chairman, and the chairman must notify the chair of the audit and risk committee.

No breaches of the Code of Ethics or Insider Trading Policy were reported in the year.



Principle 2. Board composition and performance
“To ensure an effective board, there should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and perspectives.”

Seeka’s Board commits to acting in the best interests of the company, deliver benefits to stakeholders and grow shareholder returns.

Board charter and responsibilities
The Board’s charter sets out the Board’s structure, appointments, remuneration, committees and process for performance review, along with the
duties and responsibilities of the Board and chief executive officer. Seeka’s Board is primarily responsible for:

  • Robust and effective health and safety systems and standards

  • Establishing corporate objectives and strategies

  • Monitoring management’s implementation of Seeka’s strategies

  • Approving budgets and monitoring financial performance

  • Managing risk to Seeka’s business

  • Ensuring timely and transparent stakeholder and market communication

The Board delegates the chief executive officer to lead and manage Seeka’s operations, including being the company’s principal representative. The
chief executive officer is not a Board member.


Board composition
Seeka’s Company Constitution specifies that the Board has a minimum of three and a maximum of seven directors, with provision for an eighth
to be appointed between annual shareholder meetings. Directors are to contribute a mix of complementary skills that support Seeka’s objectives
and strategies, with at least two being independent, and at least two ordinarily residing in New Zealand. To maintain proper separation between
governance and management, all directors are non-executive and the constitution has no provision for a managing director.

Seeka’s Board currently has seven directors, led by the independent chairman Fred Hutchings. Non-independent director Amiel Diaz is the only
director residing overseas.

The following table summarises director qualifications, skills and experience.

Director independence
The Board’s Charter follows NZX Listing Rules to determine the independence of a director. Directors must inform the Board of all relevant
information and the Board confirms director independence at least annually.

Two directors are appointees of large shareholders and deemed non independent;

  • Amiel Diaz, representative of Seeka’s shareholder Farmind Corporation of Japan, and

  • Ratahi Cross, representative of Seeka shareholder Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited and is the chairman of the Ngai Tukairangi Trust, a large kiwifruit
    grower supplying Seeka.

As Seeka’s foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers experience in the kiwifruit industry a core competency. Three directors have extensive
experience in kiwifruit production and handling, and through their extensive interests in kiwifruit orchards that supply Seeka are considered non-
independent directors;

  • Martyn Brick

  • John Burke, and

  • Ratahi Cross

As required, the chairman establishes a nominations committee to review the Board’s composition and performance, and recommend people with
complementary skills to join the Board. Nominees can be appointed by the Board, with the appointment to be approved by shareholders at the next
annual shareholder meeting, or nominated and elected to the Board by shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting. The Board provides guidance
to shareholders on a candidate’s suitability for appointment or reappointment.

Directors enter a written agreement covering the term of their appointment and are provided with detailed information about Seeka, the company’s
strategies, policies and procedures, and any other training or other support that will help the director become a fully-functioning member of the
Board.

nominations committee and external advisors.


Director profiles
Director profiles are listed on Seeka’s website (see Seeka.co.nz/investors), and are included on page 79 of this annual report. Full disclosure of
director interests according to section 140 (2) of the Companies Act 1993 are listed on page 81 of this annual report.


Diversity
Diversity is the range of attributes held by members of a group. Seeka’s Board believes diversity within the Board and the company provides a deeper
understanding of stakeholders, broadens the range of skills available to Seeka, and will lead to improved business performance.

The Board works to optimise diversity across director members, while managing an efficient governance process. The Board’s focus is on diversity in
culture and ethnicity, business skills and innovative thinking as these attributes are key to understanding the operating environment of our key clients,
creating unique solutions, and improving stakeholder outcomes and shareholder returns.

With Seeka’s key client groups diversely spread from rural New Zealand to large urban centres, Seeka’s Board has encompassed cultural, ethnic and
gender diversity to strengthen business governance:

  • Ratahi Cross of Ngai Tukairangi is also a lecturer in Māori history

  • Amiel Diaz is a Filipino businessman based in Asia

  • Martyn Brick, John Burke, Cecilia Tarrant and Ashley Waugh have rural backgrounds

The following table reports gender composition of the Board and senior management team as at 31 December 2019.

Professional development
Directors are supported to undertake professional development through individual training and by attending relevant courses. In 2019 the Board also
met with experts in produce marketing and governance.


Evaluation of board and director performance
The Board Charter specifies that the chairman undertakes an annual review of Board and director performance. The chairman's 2019 review found
that the Board and directors have fulfilled all their duties and responsibilities for sound corporate governance as specified by the Board Charter.



Principle 3. Board committees
“The board should use committees where this will enhance its effectiveness in key areas, while still retaining board responsibility.”

The Board has established two permanent committees and will form ad-hoc committees to efficiently and effectively carry out key governance
functions, while retaining ultimate responsibility for all decisions and actions.

All committees operate under written charters which define the role, authority and operations of the committee. All Seeka directors and committee
members are non-executive, and Seeka management and other employees may only attend committee meetings when invited by the committee. The
Board reviews the remuneration and nominations committee charters biennially and the audit and risk committee charter annually.


Committee membership and workload management
Seeka is governed by a seven-member non-executive Board with three independent directors. To provide effective and transparent committee
governance, while managing workload across Board members, Seeka’s committee charters ensure each committee is chaired by an independent
director, with committee members drawn from both independent and non-independent directors that furnish the best skill set. The audit and risk
committee charter specifies a majority of independent directors.

The current standing committees are:

In the event of a takeover offer, the Board Charter provides for the formation of an ad-hoc initial response committee and an independent takeover
response committee to enact the procedures and protocols of the Board's Takeover Response Manual.

To date there has been no need to convene an initial response committee meeting or form an independent takeover response committee.

While the Board considers the current range of committees comprehensively manages the governance of Seeka’s business, and provides the best
outcomes for shareholders and other stakeholders, the Board Charter allows ad-hoc committees to be formed as required to aid Board decision
making.

Principle 4. Reporting and disclosure
“The board should demand integrity in financial and non-financial reporting, and in the timeliness and balance of corporate disclosures.”

Seeka’s Board is committed to keeping investors and the wider market fully informed of all material information concerning the company’s operating
environment and business performance. In addition to all information required by law and NZX Listing Rules, Seeka provides stakeholders with a mid-
year performance update, along with regular operational updates to supplying clients.

Seeka's Continuous Disclosure Policy covers the classification, timing and release of material information to investors and other stakeholders. The
chairman, chair of the audit and risk committee, chief executive and chief financial officer (the disclosure committee) are responsible for identifying
material information between Board meetings, with continuous disclosure covered at every Board meeting.

As stewards of more than 300 orchards in New Zealand and Australia, Seeka is committed to applying industry best practices and international
guidelines for all asset management, backed up by rigorous auditing. This includes certification to the international GLOBALG.A.P standard for good
agricultural practice that focuses production and supply management on the consumer’s demand for safe food. See www.globalgap.org.

Seeka as an employer is focused on sustainable land management that supports long-term employment and wealth creation in our rural
communities, and has formally implemented the GLOBALG.A.P GRASP module with its extended social standards for worker health, safety and
welfare. See www.globalgap.org/uk_en/for-producers/globalg.a.p.-add-on/grasp/.

In New Zealand, Seeka has partnered with all supplying growers to form independent, grower-controlled entities that manage grower fruit value;
kiwifruit growers appoint Seeka Growers Limited as their agent for the supply of kiwifruit to Seeka, with avocado growers appointing AvoFresh
Limited. See www.seeka.co.nz/seeka-grower-council and www.seeka.co.nz/avofresh.

Seeka Growers Limited and AvoFresh Limited manage market returns in independent bank accounts, approve all service distributions and grower
payments, and publish independently-audited annual statements. Seeka is represented on the entities’ controlling councils, provides management
support, and ensures grower representatives are kept informed on market conditions, industry issues and Seeka’s operational performance for their
fruit.

Seeka complies with the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the Companies Act 1993, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the NZX
Listing Rules. Seeka also supports environmental, social and governance concerns, and discloses to the markets any environmental factors that may
materially affect operations.

In 2019 Seeka implemented a sustainability team to develop Seeka's environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy and processes. Drawing
together staff that are passionate about sustainability from all areas of our operations, and working with external advisors including regional and
national experts, Seeka's sustainability team has started developing a formal ESG reporting framework. Our objective is to develop consistent
reporting so stakeholders can understand how Seeka is adapting our business to manage risk and take advantage of new opportunities in our every-
changing operating environment. The three elements to Seeka's reporting framework will be:

– Social - how we manage relations with stakeholders, including employees, grower clients, our communities and our retail partners

– Governance - how we govern our business, manage risk, realise opportunities and comply with relevant legislation and stakeholder expectations



Principle 5. Remuneration
“The remuneration of directors and executives should be transparent, fair and reasonable.”


Director remuneration
In accordance with the Board Charter, the chairman uses independent professional advice and market information to review director remuneration
within a two year period, with shareholders having to approve any increase to the pool available to pay directors’ fees. Approval was last sought in
April 2018, when the pool limit was set at $450,000 per annum. Directors are remunerated by fixed fees that are set according to expected time
commitments and responsibilities as determined by the Board. Directors receive no equity-based remuneration, and receive no performance or
retirement benefits. Directors are not required to own Seeka shares.

The following table reports the allocation of the pool at the date of this report, and directors’ fees paid during the financial year. No other benefits
were remunerated to directors during the year.

Employee share scheme

In May 2019, 8,000 shares allocated under the 2016 employee share scheme at $3.88 per share vested and were paid for by the chief executive for a
total consideration of $27,040 ($3.38 per share).

At balance date, the chief executive had 8,000 shares allocated April 2019 at $4.76 per share under the employee share scheme. These shares vest
2022.



Principle 6. Risk management
“Directors should have a sound understanding of the material risks faced by the issuer and how to manage them. The board should regularly verify
that the issuer has appropriate processes that identify and manage potential and material risks.”

The Board consider risk management an important governance function to protect stakeholders, build long-term wealth in our communities and
optimise shareholder value. The Board retains ultimate control of risk management, with the audit and risk committee providing a specific focus on
material risks as defined in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter.

While no risk management system can completely remove business and financial risks, our goal is to ensure material risks are appropriately identified
and managed within acceptable levels. We accomplish this through a strategic focus, active management, contingency planning and a sensible
balance between costs and anticipated benefits. Wherever appropriate, the processes are consistent with AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management
Principles and Guidelines.

Financial statements and key operational measures are prepared monthly and reviewed by the Board throughout the year to assess business
performance against budget and forecasts.

The Board composition includes directors with long-term experience in New Zealand’s kiwifruit industry, and Australian and Asian produce handling
and marketing. Board meetings include periodic site visits in New Zealand and Australia to ensure all directors understand the Group’s operating
environments when assessing material risk.

The Board’s complementary skill set and understanding of the core business have allowed it to implement strategies to mitigate risk associated with
being a New Zealand kiwifruit handler by diversifying operations across multiple products, expanding into the Australian market and sourcing revenue
from more points along the value chain. Since the incursion of the kiwifruit vine-killing disease Psa in 2010, Seeka has transformed from being a New
Zealand kiwifruit handler to become an Australasian produce business involved in the growing, handling, supply and marketing of multiple products.

Seeka has appropriate insurance cover, as available, for property damage to its offices, post harvest, processing and fruit handling facilities, along with
insurance cover for hail damage to crops.

The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB; Halyomorpha halys) remains one of the top pests of concern for New Zealand's horticultural industry. A
native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and accidentally introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s, adult BMSB feed on fruit and make them
unmarketable. The Ministry of Primary Industries is working with industry groups along with the public to prevent the unintended import of BMSB,
including eradication protocols if BMSB are detected in New Zealand. Seeka personnel and supplying growers are informed on how to identify BMSB
and the immediate actions to be undertaken if the pest is found.


Health and safety
Operating in a seasonal industry, in 2019 Seeka employed more than 3,000 people working in multiple complex environments. This includes 24-hour
operations over the harvest period. Group salary and wages equate to 1,245 full time equivalents.

The Board is responsible for health and safety across Group operations, with the chief executive appointing a health and safety manager to ensure
Seeka complies with legislation and operates industry best practice across the Group, while also supporting the management of health and safety
risks by clients and suppliers. The Board reviews performance against set targets at each meeting.

The following table reports key health and safety measures and targets in 2019.


                                                                                                       2019 Annual threshold               2019 Actuals

1. The total recordable injury frequent rate (TRIFR) measures the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked. In total Seeka worked a total of 2.70m hours in 2019, with
   the number of operating hours varying with the total volumes Seeka packs and handles across all varieties and sites. Seasonal pressures can be challenging along with
   harvest deadlines. Seeka TRIFR was 5.0 for 2019.

2. Severity rate measures the average number of days that an injured person is away from work. Seeka had 3 notifiable injuries including incidents in 2019.

Principle 7. Auditors
“The board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.”

Seeka’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter outlines Seeka’s commitment to an independent audit process that provides shareholders and the markets
with objective, robust, clear and timely financial reporting.

The audit and risk committee in consultation with management and the external auditor reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of the external
audit process, and provides a formal channel of communication between the Board, senior management and the external auditor. The audit and risk
committee:

  • Oversees the independence of the auditor and ensures they conduct their operations free from any actual or perceived impairments, and

  • Monitors the provision of any services beyond the auditor’s statutory audit services.

For financial year 2019, Pip Cameron of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was the external auditor for Seeka Limited. PwC has confirmed its
independence to the audit and risk committee, and that its independence was not compromised during the reporting period. The last audit partner
rotation was in FY16.

PwC auditors attend the annual shareholder meeting to answer any shareholder questions about the audit.


Internal audit
Seeka has a number of internal controls overseen by the audit and risk committee to ensure the integrity of key financial and operational data. This
includes data access, internal financial controls, adequate resourcing, targeted internal audit programmes and monitoring management’s response to
external audit findings.

Due to the size of Group operations, rather than operating a dedicated financial audit function, Seeka uses its compliance team to conduct internal
audit processes and monitor operational compliance, along with independent providers to regularly test the integrity of the Group’s financial systems.
Directors also pay particular attention to matters raised by PwC, the external auditor.



Principle 8. Shareholder rights and relations
“The board should respect the rights of shareholders and foster constructive relationships with shareholders that encourage them to engage with
the issuer.”

Seeka’s shareholders include a significant number of grower clients, employees, suppliers and people living in our rural communities. Seeka maintains
open channels of communication with a diverse range of groups to uphold our key brand attribute of delivering excellence to all stakeholders.

The Board is motivated and committed to transparent and regular reporting and engagement with shareholders including:

  • Annual and interim reports

  • Market announcements

  • Annual shareholder meeting

  • Mid-year stakeholder meeting

  • Ad-hoc investor presentations

  • Attendance of directors at seasonal grower roadshows held throughout the catchment for each produce type

  • Quarterly staff updates

  • Clear access to investor information on the company’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/investors

  • Open access to senior managers via phone and email, see Seeka.co.nz/senior-management-team

Shareholders are actively encouraged to attend the annual shareholder meeting and mid-year stakeholder update, where they can raise matters for
discussion by directors and senior management. Shareholders vote on major decisions which affect Seeka at the annual shareholder meeting. Voting
is by poll, conducted by the Company’s registrar Link Market Services and overseen by the company’s auditor PwC, on a one share, one vote principle.

Shareholders are provided with copies of the annual report, and are encouraged to receive electronic communication by contacting our registrar Link
Market Services, see Linkmarketservices.co.nz. The annual shareholders notice of meeting is posted on the NZX website and sent to shareholders
at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. A link to Seeka’s announcements can be directly accessed from Seeka’s website, see Seeka.co.nz/nzx-
announcements.

When raising new capital, when practical the Board will offer a scheme that allows existing shareholders to further invest in the Company so they can
maintain their relative proportion of Seeka's issued shares.

Seeka’s current and historical share price is located on the NZX website, see nzx.com/instruments/SEK

Differences in practice to NZX Code
The following table summarises the material differences between Seeka’s corporate governance and the Code during the year. Where there are
differences, these have been approved by the Board.


                                                                                                                                    Period of non
 Principle             Concerning                   Key difference                                                                  compliance

 2. Board        2.8 A majority of the board        The board charter specifies a minimum of two independent directors.             At all relevant
 Composition         should be independent                                                                                          times
 and                 directors.                     As Seeka's foundation business is kiwifruit, the Board considers it
 Performance                                        appropriate to have a mix of directors with extensive experience in kiwifruit
                                                    production and handling, who in the normal course of business would supply
                                                    Seeka with produce from their ongoing orcharding interests. The Board must
                                                    also appropriately represent large shareholders.

                                                    The specified minimum of two independent directors provides the flexibility
                                                    to meet these two criteria, while also ensuring Board decisions reflect the
                                                    best interests of Seeka and its security holders.

                                                    Currently, four directors are deemed non-independent; two for their
                                                    extensive interests in orchards that supply Seeka (industry expertise),
                                                    one an appointee of a large shareholder (market expertise), and one that
                                                    has extensive interests in orchards that supply Seeka as well as being an
                                                    appointee of a large shareholder (industry expertise).

                                                    Three of the seven directors (a minority) are independent.

 3. Board        3.1   Audit and risk committee     Following changes to the audit and risk committee charter on 24 July            1 January 2019 to

                                                    Martyn Brick retired from the committee. The audit and risk committee
                                                    currently complies with the code by having a majority of independent
                                                    directors.

                                                    Prior to the charter change, to manage work load across the Board and best
                                                    utilise skills, the audit and risk committee had an independent chair and two
                                                    non-independent directors.

                 3.3   Remuneration committee       To manage workload across the Board, the charter only specifies an              At all relevant

                 3.4 Standing nominations           Nominations Committee Charter allows for the formation of an ad-hoc             At all relevant
                     committee.                     committee as required. To manage workload across the Board, the charter         times
                                                    only specifies an independent chair.
