                Chair and Chief Executive's report

                Seeka's Board and management are delighted to present the Seeka Interim Report for
                the six months ended 30 June 2025, with Seeka recording a $59.4 million net profit
                before tax, compared to $45.0 million in the previous corresponding period (pcp).
                Seeka’s financial results have benefitted from handling higher volumes along with
                Seeka's strategies to lift performance to shareholders and stakeholders.


                Net profit after tax of $37.8 million is well up on the pcp’s $17.1 million, which was
                negatively impacted by a deferred tax adjustment from a legislated change to tax
                deductibility of non-residential buildings 1.


                Seeka continued to reduce debt and build balance sheet resilience. Net bank debt of
                $130.6 million is $40.2 million lower than at June 2024, with a leverage ratio of 1.57:1.
                Seeka further lowered debt in July 2025 when it banked $64.8 million.

                Highlights for the six months.

                                                                                                 6 months to       6 months to
                 New Zealand dollars                                                                                                 Change

                1. In interpreting Seeka’s results, note that legislation enacted in March 2024 removed the tax deductibility of depreciation on
                non-residential buildings and had the effect of increasing Seeka’s deferred tax charge in the condensed statement of profit and
                loss by $13.9m in the six months to June 2024 and by $12.5m for the full 2024 year.

All of Seeka’s business segments delivered higher earnings in the period
New Zealand kiwifruit volumes, the core of Seeka’s business, were up 10% with 47.1 million class 1
trays packed in New Zealand, compared to 43.0 million in 2024. Higher volumes were largely the
result of an excellent growing season and higher yields. This improved earnings for our orcharding
and post harvest business segments.
2025 volumes were within post harvest capacity, with Seeka closely managing capital expenditure
to focus on programmed capital maintenance while investing in automation where it delivers
efficiencies.
New packing solutions are being implemented for the 2026 season with machinery upgrades for
Kerikeri and Huka Pak. Incorporating Reemoon technology, Seeka’s automation investments are set
to deliver efficiencies by handling more fruit through the existing facilities at lower unit costs. Seeka
is also evaluating the trial of a fully automated “lights-out” coolstore that may deliver a step change
in returns on coolstore assets.
Inflationary pressures remain, including the major expenditure items of electricity and packaging.
Seeka is working to limit the impact of cost pressures on the business and its customers.
Seeka operates in a cyclical and seasonal industry, with higher earnings in the first six months of the
year.


Dividend
In the first half of 2025 Seeka paid $0.15 per share in dividends; $0.10 on 20 January 2025 and $0.05
on 15 April 2025.
A further dividend of $0.15 per share was announced on 19 August 2025, to be paid on 15 October
2025 with a record date of 18 September 2025. The dividend is fully imputed and the dividend
reinvestment plan will apply.

                Business segment and other updates

                Orcharding
                Seeka’s orcharding business provides professional orchard management, leasing and long-term
                leasing (orchard development) services. Seeka’s service to orchard owners secures a significant
                proportion of kiwifruit, Kiwiberry and avocado handled by Seeka’s post harvest business.
                Seeka grew 19.1 million class 1 trays in 2025, up 12% on the pcp’s 17.1 million trays.
                Importantly, our orcharding business continues to grow, with Seeka investing in long term leases.
                This includes co-investments with iwi and Kānoa to develop some 70 hectares of new kiwifruit
                orchards in the Raukokore region. The initial orchards produced their first crop in 2025, with volumes
                forecast to increase as the new orchards progressively enter full production.
                Seeka leads the industry in the development of Kiwiberry. This adds a profitable and valuable
                category to New Zealand’s horticultural industry.
                EBIT for the six months of $7.9 million compares favourably against the pcp’s $1.8 million, benefitting
                from stronger yields and improved margins.

Post harvest
Seeka’s post harvest business delivers harvest, packing, coolstorage, inventory management and
distribution for its grower customers covering kiwifruit, avocado, persimmon and citrus. The business
holds the majority of Seeka’s assets with kiwifruit the core activity.
Total kiwifruit volumes of 47.1 million trays was up 10% on the pcp's 43.0 million trays. Volumes
remained within Seeka’s capacity.
Seeka adheres to a strict capital maintenance programme of core infrastructure assets, with a
focus on coolstore plant and electrical switchboard upgrades which reduce Seeka’s risk profile and
associated insurance costs.
To increase handling capacity from existing facilities and improve efficiencies, Seeka is investing
in automation for harvest 2026 with new Reemoon technology confirmed for Seeka Kerikeri and
Seeka’s Huka Pak facility in Tauranga.
EBIT of $68.6 million compares favourably against the pcp’s $60.0 million, benefitting from the lift in
volumes and ongoing focus on efficiency and margins.

                SeekaFresh
                Seeka’s retail services business “SeekaFresh” markets and distributes locally grown and imported
                produce to retail customers in New Zealand and abroad.
                Despite tough local market conditions, SeekaFresh continues to optimise grower returns by
                accessing high-value markets for the core kiwifruit, avocado and Kiwiberry categories. SeekaFresh is
                also building its tropical imports business.
                Seeka purchased the assets of Olivado during the six months. This has reset SeekaFresh’s avocado
                oil manufacturing and marketing business, and while a minor transaction, it delivers local capacity to
                process SeekaFresh’s oil grade avocado in Northland.
                EBIT of $1.0 million compares favourably with pcp’s $0.6 million. The business continues to build in a
                competitive environment.

                Financing
                Seeka has focused on debt levels, leverage ratios and building financial resilience. Seeka sold its last
                Northland orchard and has carefully managed capital expenditure. The Sharp Road accommodation facility
                that was held for sale has been retained by the company.
                Net bank debt at 30 June 2025 totalled $130.6 million, down $40.2 million on 30 June 2024. The resulting
                leverage ratio at 1.57 : 1 is much improved from previous years. Seeka is focused on gradually reducing debt.


                Sustainability
                Good progress has been made on Seeka’s sustainability strategy and targets, with a focus on lowering
                Seeka’s carbon footprint and impact on the environment. Seeka continues to retrofit coolstore systems with
                natural refrigerants, and 2025 gas leaks were lower than at the same point in 2024. Energy audits have been
                rolled out across major sites, and later in 2025 the next phase of solar will be installed at Seeka’s Peninsula
                site.
                Seeka donated kiwifruit to the NZ Food Network to help feed families and Seeka continues to contribute to
                the rural communities we operate in.


                People
                Seeka people have continued to outperform. Our people are the source of our success and across our
                business they remain dedicated to strategy and outcome delivery. The quality of our people is the true
                measure of our business.
                We continue to focus on safety and wellbeing, including a heightened safety awareness programme, and to
                date there have been no serious harm injuries in the business in 2025.
                Our people and capability practices have evolved, and in addition to approximately 650 permanent
                employees and 1200 other seasonal staff, Seeka employs more than 1200 RSE employees, which requires
                extensive planning, deployment and pastoral support.
                Seeka continues to support the development of our people with development programmes, cadetships and
                opportunities for career advancement. Seeka’s performance over the last six months has been achieved by
                the efforts of our people, and we thank them for their effort and endurance.
                Our people are key to the culture that we enjoy.

Forward focus and outlook
Seeka has rebuilt following the disruptions of Covid-19 followed by poor growing seasons. The
company successfully managed the challenges and built on last year’s improved performance to
once again deliver record results in the first half of 2025.
Seeka operates in a seasonal industry, with a significant portion of our earnings delivered in the first
six months of the year. Given the strong interim result, we expect full year profit before tax to be in
the range of $35.0 million to $39.0 million compared to 2024’s $29.7 million.
While it is too early to make a reliable prediction on the 2026 crop, 2025 winter chill in most regions
has been better than at the same point last year. This lifts the probability of a good kiwifruit season in
2026.
Your company and its people have worked hard. We thank our people, stakeholders and growers for
their diligence and support. And we thank you for your continuing interest and support.

         The Directors have concluded that the Group will continue to operate
         as a going concern and the condensed financial statements are
         prepared on that basis.

Performance
This section focuses on the Group’s financial performance and details the contributions made from the individual operating segments.

1. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments engage in business activities that earn revenues, incur expenses and are reported in a manner consistent with
the internal reports provided to the chief decision makers, being the Directors, who regularly evaluate the allocation of resources alongside
operational outcomes, such as EBITDA and EBIT, and are responsible for setting strategic direction.
The Group has five operating segments:
– Four New Zealand segments express the range of complementary services delivered to New Zealand’s produce industries and the retail sector.
– A single Australian operating segment covers the integrated supply chain service for the Group’s Australian-grown fruit.
Direct segment revenues and operating costs are allocated to each segment. Administration costs, overheads, grower service costs and other
income from the sale of assets recorded in the statement of profit or loss are allocated to Other segments. Transactions between segments are
conducted on normal commercial terms and at market rates and are eliminated on consolidation.
Segment information is prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.

New Zealand segments
Orchard operations
The Group provides on-orchard management services to orchard owners who produce kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry crops.
The Group produces kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and Kiwiberry from:
– Short term leased orchards (typically three-year rolling contracts) whereby the Group recovers costs and shares any profits with the orchard
  owners.
– Long term leased land which the Group has developed into productive orchards, provides capital funding, owns all crops for the term of the
  lease, and shares profit with the landowner after all costs are recovered from crop proceeds.
– Owned orchards whereby the Group incurs growing and harvest costs and receives all orchard income from crop sales.
Post harvest operations
The Group provides post harvest services to the kiwifruit, avocado, citrus and persimmon industries. This includes all crops from the Group’s
orchard management and lease operations, plus crops from independent orchard owners.
Retail service operations
The Group provides fruit marketing services in New Zealand and internationally, particularly in the Australian and Asian markets. This includes
fruit from the Group’s New Zealand based orchard and post-harvest operations. In New Zealand the Group also provides retail and ripening
services for imported fruit, and operates a wholesale market.
Retail service operations include the production and selling of Kiwi Crush™, Kiwi Crushies and avocado oil to the retail sector and hospitals, along
with post harvest services for Kiwiberry.
Other segments
This represents the Group’s aggregated administration, grower services and overhead sections recorded in the condensed statement of profit or
loss, and impairment and revaluations of other assets not attributed directly to any other segment. It also includes the gain on sale from assets
that had been classified as held for sale, and are not attributed directly to any other segment.

Australian operations
The Group grows, provides post harvest services, and retails all produce from orchards the Group owns or leases in Australia. The main products
are kiwifruit, nashi pears, European pears, jujubes and plums which are primarily sold in Australia.




EBITDA and EBIT
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairments and revaluations. EBITDA is an indicator of profitability and
reflects operating cash flow generation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax; an indicator of profitability that excludes interest and income tax expenses.
Non-GAAP financial information does not have a standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar financial
information presented by other entities. The Board considers EBITDA and EBIT as useful measures of financial performance for both investors
and management as they are indicators of the Group's operating profitability that remove the impact of tax and the interest expenses associated
with debt and leases (EBIT), along with depreciation, amortisation, impairment and revaluation expenses associated with the Group's large
investments in fixed and leased assets (EBITDA).

Turnover

services provided to external customers during the year. As such turnover includes the value of fruit sales made on behalf of growers and suppliers
where the Group acts as the agent, and is considered the supplier by the purchasing party. This includes all produce sales both local and export.

         Assets under construction are assets that are yet to be capitalised and are not depreciated. When the asset is ready for use it is transferred to the
         appropriate asset class.
         Land and buildings
         Land and buildings are revalued to their estimated market value on at least a three-year rolling cycle (excluding assets under construction), plus
         any subsequent additions at cost, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. In New Zealand valuations are undertaken by CBRE Group Inc.,
         independent registered valuer.
         In Australia, valuations were completed at 31 December 2024 by Opteon (Goulburn North East Vic) Pty Limited, independent valuers based in
         Victoria, Australia.
         As at 30 June 2025, the Directors believe there are no indicators that would suggest that the carrying value of land and buildings differs materially
         from their fair value and as a consequence there is no need to revalue this class of assets at 30 June 2025.
         Impairment
         In the six months to 30 June 2025, impairments include $0.46m of poor performing pears cut out in Australia, and $0.59m of post harvest assets
         following the removal of old equipment, to be replaced later in the year (Jun 2024 – Nil, Dec 2024 - $0.30m).


         Critical accounting estimates and judgements
         At 30 June 2025, the Group reviewed the carrying value of its land and buildings, considering current market conditions and input from its external
         valuer. Management concluded there were no indicators of impairment or material differences from fair value.
         In line with Group policy, independent valuations will be obtained at 31 December 2025.

At 30 June 2025 Seeka's market capitalisation was less than its net assets which is an indicator of impairment. The Group has performed an
impairment test to ensure that future cash flows of the Group support the fair value of the assets.
Goodwill balances are assessed annually for impairment. The impairment tests are performed using a value in use calculation model.
The recoverable amount is based on the net present value of the five-year after-tax cash flow projection (value-in-use), with a terminal value
beyond five years. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates and discount rates. The assumptions
used for the analysis of the net present value of forecast gross margins are determined based on forecast crop volumes, past financial
performance and the Board's expectation of future market dynamics, plus the Group's current year forecasts and five year financial plans.
The Group's goodwill and asset value are supported by historical profitability, increasing volume forecasts, and forecast growth of the kiwifruit
industry and returns.
No impairment was noted as a result of the impairment test.


Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The impairment tests require judgement to determine the appropriate forecast cash flows and inputs into the calculations. The primary estimates
relate to the forecast EBITDA growth rates, discount rates, WACC and terminal growth rates.

         7. Biological assets - crop
         Crops growing on bearer plants are classified as biological assets and measured at fair value.
         Crop assets are kiwifruit, nashi pears, Packham pears, Corella pears, and other crops growing on leased and owned orchards yet to be harvested
         at balance date.
